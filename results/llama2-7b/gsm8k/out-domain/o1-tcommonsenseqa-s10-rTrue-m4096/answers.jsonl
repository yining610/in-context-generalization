From the question, we know that there were 2 pounds of jellies beans and 3 pounds of brownies (given that 3 times of 3 lbs = 9 lb). Therefore, the amount of jelly beans added will be 1 lb (given that 1 lb = 2 Q). The amount of brownies added will be 3 lb (given that  2 times of 3 lb = 6 lb).\n   Next, we will need to determine the amount of jelly bean and brownies that were previously present in the box of goodies (given that there were 2 lb of jellies beans). From the problem, we know that there was originally a box of 2 lb. If there were 1 lb of jelly beans, then  1/2 lb is still left. So, the number of jelly bean should be 1 lb. Similarly, if there were 3 lb of brownies, then  2/3 lb is still left. Therefore, the number of brownies should be 2 lb.\n   Therefore, the final solution is:\n\n   F _box of goodies_(lb) = 2 lb + (1 lb) + (3 lb) + (1 lb)  +  2(lb) = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1  +  2 (lb) = 2 _lb +_ 1  + 3 _lb +_ 4 _lb =_ 2 _lb + 6 _lb =_ 8 _lb.\nSo the final weight of the package is 8 lb", "answer": " 16"}

We know that she bought a pair of shoes as well, but the receipt was lost, so we don't know how much she spent on them.\nThe $106 we're interested in here includes only the clothing items, so we subtract it from the total budget before proceeding. Now, her budget is $84, so she can't have spent any more on the shoes beyond what we already know.\n2. With that in mind, we can start plugging in numbers. First, let's assume she spent $20 on the shoes (since she lost the receipt, this is the highest amount that makes sense). That leaves her with $16 left from the $84 budget. The rest of the problem is a simple matter of math:\n     $16 = $20 - ($106 - $16) / $84 = $16 - (106 / 84 ) => 10(6 / 84) = 16 (The equation above simplifies to 10(6/84) = 8)\n10(6/ 84) = (10 (6/84 - 1) + 10 (6/ 84 - 2) + 10(6/- 84) => (10*6/84 -1) + (10*6/(84-1)) => (950/81) => [950(81)/ 84] => [10(950) /1] => [10*(950) /84] => [9500 / 84] => 115\n115 = 16\n\n### Evaluation:\nHow long do you think it took you to get this right?

Taking that information together, we know Samantha's full name must be Jamie Grey if Jamie's first name is \"Jamie\".\n4. From there, we can subtract three from 26 to get 23, as this is the number of letters in Bobbie's last name.\n5. To find Jamie's first and last name, we know that her first name is Jamie, giving us the three letters \"Ja\"\n6. Therefore, we have the following: JaKeS is the first and last of 23 letters and JaKe is the last and first of 23 letters with 22 in between.\n\nInput: The sum of the four digits in 714 is a perfect square, so is the sum of its digits.

Next, let's figure out how much each shorts costs.\n     Sol:Because we now know that each shoe costs $5, we can multiply $5 for 5 to find the cost of each shorts to be $25\n3. Finally, let's determine the cost of the tops.\n     Sol:From the previous step, we already know that a single top costs Ann $7. Given that she bought 4 of them, each top should cost $7 * 4 = $28.

This means we must first calculate how much money he earns per hour at each job and then combine the two.\n2. The first step is to determine how much he earns per hour.

Let\u2019s go through the options to determine the correct answer:\n   A: 4 months after the fight, the boxer will weigh 97 kg\n\n     Since he is on a diet and allowed to lose 3 kg/month, and it\u2019s been 4 months since the fight, his weight reduction is 36 kg\n\n     Therefore, 97 - 36 kg = 61 kg, which is the answer.\n\nSo A: 4 months from the fight\n\n   B: He weighs 88 kg on the day of the match\n     This option says the boxer weighs more after the fight than before. However, this is not correct given the information we\u2019ve been told.\n     After the fight, it\u2019s possible that the boxer may have gained weight from eating more and drinking more because they are exhausted from the fight and want to recover.

{"idx": 80, "text": "1. The question is comparing the years that James and his partner have both spend teaching.\n2. To determine the combined years, we can simply add the years together. We'll also need to account for James's 40 years of teaching, so we'll need to subtract James's 4 decades from the combined total.\n4. Therefore, we can determine that James's partner has been teaching for  10 years less, which means that James's partner's time teaching is 30 years(10 years x 3 decades = 3 decades).\n5. So, when we add James's partner'sdecades to James's decades together, we get 8 decades (James + partner).\n6. Finally, we subtract James's 8 decades from the combined 8 decades, which gives us the combined years of 4 decades (8 - James's 8).\n\n### Conclusion\n\nFrom this example, we can see that to calculate the combined years of teaching, we can use the basic formula [(James's partner's years of teaching) - (James's teaching years)].\nNote: This formula can be helpful for finding the difference between two values, such as the length of a journey. When James travels, it is important to know when to stop and what time he arrives at his destination.", "answer": " 70"}

{"idx": 95, "text": "1) Let's analyze this problem:\n   a. The first question we need to answer is how long does it take John to write 20 pages a book?\n   b. We can then multiply the number of pages by the number of books to determine the number of pages he will write in total.\n   c. Finally, we can use this total number of pages written to calculate how long it will take to write all three books.\n2) Using the information we've gathered, let's analyze it:\n   a. For the first question, we know that John writes 20 pages per book. Let's say that these 20 pages are written in a day. So each day, he completes 20 pages.\n   b. Then, for the second question, you need to multiply the number of pages they need to write by the number of books they need to write. 400 multiplied by 3 is 1200. Therefore, they need to write 4 pages at a time.\n   c. We can then use this number to calculate how long it takes to write the 1200 pages they need to write. Let's say it takes 1 hour to write 4 pages and take a break.  Therefore, they can write 1200 in 3 days.\n3) Based on this analysis, I recommend that, in this scenario, John writes 3 books that are each 400 pages, each day. And it will take 3 days to complete the project.\nSo the answer is D: 21 hours", "answer": " 60"}

Based on the question, it isn't clear if the rain collected will be all liquid. We can assume the rainwater will not be all liquid, and will include some impurities such as dirt and debris.\n3. To determine the amount of money James can set for selling all the collected water, we can use the following equation:\n   M = (Q * P) - C\n4. where M is the amount of money James receives for selling all the water collected (in dollars), Q is the amount of collected rain (in inches), P is the set price per gallon for selling water (in dollars per gallon), and C is the cost of water collection (in dollars)\n5. We can solve for M by inputting the known variables Q, P, and C into the equation above.\n5.

{"idx": 126, "text": "4. The question is asking about a growth rate and time period. We need to understand how to set up a linear equation that models this problem.\n5. Start by considering the base data: Haley grows at the constant rate of 3 inches per year.\n6. Now, translate the problem into a mathematical statement by considering the base data and rewriting it as an equation. In other words, put it into algebraic form. For example: Haley grows 3 inches per year, so to get x height in 10 years, we need to multiply 3 by 10, which is equal to 30 inches. So the equation would be written like this: x height (in inches) = 30.\n7. Now we can input the data we have - the base data, which is Haley is 20 inches tall currently. We want to know what her height will be after 10 years, so we need to solve for x.\n8. Plug in the data into the equation. In this case we have 20 + 30 = x, so the equation is written like this: 20 + x = 30. \n9. Solve the equation by subtracting 30 from both sides (20 \u2212 30 = \u221230), and then divided both sides by \u221230 (\u221230/\u221230 = 1). The solution is: x = 10 inches.

This question is asking us to solve a specific multiplication or division problem, where we must determine the number of packages the third butcher delivered.\n\n    1. First, we'll need to understand the number of packages delivered from each butcher in total:4 x packages from Butcher1, +7 x packages from Butcher2 = 11 total packagesSo far, we have 11.\n    2. Now, we'll need two more pieces of information to help us solve the question:\n      - 100 lb of beef delivered by all three butchers \n\n    3. Therefore, we can use our knowledge of multiplication to solve the problem. We can do this by multiplying the number of packages delivered by each butcher with the weight of the beef in each package. For example, Butcher 1 delivered 10 packages, each weighing about 4 lb. So, we multiple 10 packages x 4 lb = 40 lb of beef. Similarly, Butcher 2 delivered 7 packages, each weighinng about 4 lb. We can multiple 7 packages x 4 lb to arrive at 28 lb of beef.\n        4. To arrive at the final answer, we can add the weight of the beer delivered by each butcher. 40 lb +28 lb. Adding 40 lb + 28 lb, we arrive at 68 lb of beef delivered from two butchers. This leaves only 32 lb of beef left to be delivered by the third butcher.\n\n68 lb + 32 lb = 100.We've done it!

Another option is to start with the total time spent on Jeoaprdy + Wheel and subtract the total time spent on Wheel since Jeopardy has 2 episodes and Wheel has 4.\nThe total time is 40 + 160 - 160 = 40 muns\nHence the answer is 2. total of 40 mins+40 mins = 80mins\n3.

{"idx": 173, "text": "There are a few strategies you can use to approach this problem, depending on your math skills and level. Here are four common ways to answer the question:\n\n1. Factoring:First, let's divide 68 stars (total) by 2 (number of empty bottles). The result is 34, which is how many stars you must make to fill both bottles.\n\n2. Grouping:Now let's look at the original bottles Kyle purchased. Each bottle can hold 15 stars, so the first 2 bottles hold 30 stars total. There are 30 more stars Kyle needs to make to fill the bottles.\n\n3. Subtraction and addition:Now let's focus on the 3 extra bottles Kyle bought. Each bottle can be filled by 15 stars, as we've already established.\n\nWe can create a table to track the number of empty bottles and stars remaining for each group of bottles:\n\nBottles | Empty Stars | Remaining Stars\n---- | ---------- | --------------\n1 | [30](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Crightarrow%207%5Cwedge%202%5Cwedge%7B30%7D) | [5](https://latex.mhchem.com/png.png?%5Crightarrow3x5)%40)\n\nBottles 2:\n\n2 | 0| 30+5=35<br>\n\nBottles3:\n\n3 | 0| 45+5 = 50\n\nNow, we can use the tables above to solve the problem. We first look at bottle 1, which has 35 empty stars and 30 remaining stars. Subtracting those two numbers leaves 5, which we can use to fill the second bottle. Next, we look at the third group of bottles, which has 50 empty stars and 35 remaining stars, so we can fill the remaining star with the bottles. Finally, we have one additional empty bottle, so we fill it with one star.\n\n4. Pattern:One strategy is to notice the pattern of the question and use that to predict the correct answer.

We can start by representing the information in mathematical equations:\n`x=` Number of rabbits\n`y=` Number of weasels\n`Rabbits=` Initial number of rabbits\n`Weasels=` Initial number of weasels\n2. The problem states that there are 10 weasels and every fox catches 4 weasels. Therefore, the total number of weasels caught is 40.\n3. We can use the equation `x= Rabbits - Weasels ` to find `x` (the number of rabbits left), which is equal to the number of weasels that originally belonged to rabbits (initial number of rabbits - total weasel count). The equation becomes: `x = rabbits - 40`\n4. Similarly, the equation `y= Weasels + Fox Catch + Fox Left ` determines the number of weasel left after an average of 4 per fox, weasel left becomes: `yn = fox catch + (y/4) + 40-y`\n5. Substituting the values, the equation becomes : `x + (y/4 + 40-Y) = 50`\n6. Putting x and y in for respective value and solving for Y it becomes : `50=40+40`Y `40-0=40`Y\n7. Therefore, the number of remaining rabbits and weasel will be `x = 50` rabbits and `y=50 `weasels\n\nSo the final answer will be `x=50`  and  `y=50`\n### Instruction:Answer the grade 4 math question below.\n\nInput: Three friends are walking around a circular track in a clockwise direction.

So, she bought 15 boxes of pizzas, as we are given 10 boxes at the cost of $14 per box and 5 additional boxes at 50 cents per box, as she paid $200 but received change.\n2. Given this information and the information provided about the cost per pizza and cost per drink, we can calculate how much she spent on pizzas and drinks.\nPizzas: $14x15 = $210Drinks: $0.5x5 = $2.50So, her total purchase was $176.50 in pizzas and $2.50 in drinks, or $248.50 in total.\nNow let's look at her change:The cost of all the items she bought was $5.50 more than the amount she spent $176.00.

So, these 8 beakers are the ones that are tested for copper ions using 45 drops in total.\n3.

So, to find X, we can first break down the problem using the information given:\n   - total package of red bouncing balls = 7 * 18\n   - total package yellow bouncing balls =6 * 18\n\n3. Now, let's apply some simple mathematics on the problem:\n   - Let X be the unknown number of more red bounce balls than yellow bounce balls.\n   - total red bounce-X balls = 7 * (18 - X)\n   - total yellow bounces = (6 - x) * 18\n   \nSo, we can solve for X like this:\n   - total red balls = 7 * X\n   - total yellow balls = 6 * 18 - 7 * X\n\n4. Subtracting one equation from the other, we get:\n   - 7 * X -6 * 18 = (X-X)\n      \n   6 * 18 +7X = 7 * X - (X-X) =0\n\n5.

Apples grow at a constant rate while a tree is growing, such that a tree is half grown after 5 years.Apples have approximately a 30% chance of rotting.\n\nYou toss a coin three times and toss a die twice.\n\nIf your tree is fully grown, how many fully grown apples do you have?\n\nOutput: If you let the growth of an apple tree go at a constant rate so that a tree is half of its way after 5 years, it takes about 10 years to fully grown an apple tree. So if we have a tree that is fully grown, after the tree is fully grown, then we have 0.5 of this tree grown after 5 years, and we have 0.25 of the tree fully grown after 10 years.\n\nSo we know that we have 2x0.5 apples. So 2x0.25 apples. so the total of this is 0.5+ 0.25.\n\nAnd we know that after 5 years, we also have some rotten apples.\n\nSo you throw out the rotten apples and then the remain amount is what fully grown apples.\n\n\n\nSo the final answer to how many fully grown appples we have if we have a tree which is fully grown after 1 years, 0.5x4+0.25x3=2.25 apples\n\nInput: You're at an airport where the boarding passes of incoming flights are randomly distributed between two separate stations (one for first class, and one for premium class).

This formula tells how many pages each book in the series has, and Sabrina can use it to find out how many pages left in each book.\n3. Sabrina can use this information in the following formula to find how many pages remain in each remaining book based on her current reading speed: # pages remaining = # of pages/how many pages she read in one month.\n4. To find out total pages, Sabrina first needs to calculate the total pages at the end of the second month, which is the sum of the first month pages minus the pages she read during that month. This formula is: # pages remaining in second month = # pages left at end of previous month - # pages she read in the previous month.\n5. Finally, Sabrina takes the difference between this total in the second month and the total in the first month.

We can see that we're given a few pieces of information regarding the number of apples in each bag and the total number of all the apples, both Pam's and Gerald's. The key detail to consider here is that each of Gerald's 40-apple bags = how many apples is in Pam's bag. Therefore, each of Gerald' 40 apples = how many apples in Pam's bag, i.e. 3 Gerald's bakets are equal to how many apples in one of Pam's bags.This means that Gerald's bakes have 1200 (total number of apples) = total number of Gerald's apple bags.

The question is asking if spending more for gas in summer would cost more in winter.\nHere are some numbers to work with:\n   In winter ($/gal) = 15.10 + 1.50 = 16.60\n   In summer ($/gal) = (16.60 + 15.1o) * 1.13 = 17.30\nWe can then find out the relation between these numbers like this:\n   (15.10 - 14.50) = 15% - 10% = 5%\n   (17.3 - 14.4*1.13) = 28.7% - 12.9%*1.13 =  16.8%\n   (15%/5%)*(17.3 -14.4 ) =   2.8 = [1.5] = yes\n   So the final answer is 'Yes' as spending more for gas during summer could cost more in winter. \n\nInput : For his birthday, Carl gives each person in his family a unique present.

In this case, the number of remaining occupants is the total number occupied seats and the original number of passengers on the bus. In other words, the number of occupants = the number of occupied seats + 16, our original number of people on the bus.\n\nTherefore, the number of free seats = number occupied seats - number people on the bus\n\nOr, the number of free / vacant seats = remaining occupied seats - seats for the original 16 people\n\nTherefore, after 2 additional stops, there are 0 empty seats.\n\nSo the final answer would be 0 empty seats.", "answer": " 57"}

{"idx": 335, "text": "11. The question is about the cost of making 1 quart of each type of ice cream. The cost will be equal to the sum of the ingredient expenses (strawberries and raspberries and heavy cream) plus the container expense.\n\n2. Let' s break down the expenses:\n\na) **Strawberry ingredient expense: $2.50**: Since we need 4 cups of strawberries, each 2 cup strawberry container will cost $2.50, resulting in a total expense of $2.50 for the strawberries.\n   \nb) Raspberry ingredient expence:$10.00$: Since we need 2 cups of raspberries, each 4 cup raspberry container will cost $10. This results in a total expense for the raspberries of $10.00\n\nc) Heavy cream expense: $7.60: Since we need 2 quarts of heavy cream, each 4 quart container will cost $7.60, resulting in a heavy cream expense of $7.60.\n \n3. So, the sum of these expenses is:\n\n```\nStrawberry ingredients expense + Raspberry ingredients expence +  Heavy cream expence > > >   $2.50+$10.00+$7.60 = $20.10\n```\n\n4. So, to answer the question, we can conclude that it will cost $20.1 to make 1 quart for strawberry ice creams and $20.1.", "answer": " 20"}

We already know that John's total cost comes to $2100 ($500 for the piano and $1200 the teacher), and that the discount was $300, meaning that John received a 25 percent discount.\n3: To solve for the discount, we divide $2100 by $1500 and come up with $1.4.

The formula would be (37.5 \u00f7 12) acres= 3.125 acres, which will be harvested in one month.\n\nThe number of bales of grass harvested each month can be calculated as:\n\n**(5 + 21 + 59) \u00f7 12** \n\n= 75, which will be harvests in one month.\nNext, let's calculate by what time the total number of bale will be harvested.\n\n**12 (75 \u00f7 5)**\n\n= 1,500 Days\nTherefore, 1,507 months in 18 years, so 184 months.\nSo the final number of bales will be harvest in 3 3 years, 5 months.\nThus, the farmer would not have left any bales of hay by the end of December.\nFinal:\nThe hay farmer would not have any hay leftover by the end of winter if he also owns 9\nhorses that eat 3 bales of grass per day.", "answer": " 12834"}

The triangle must be congruent if the angles between the alternate sides are equal and if the sides are proportional but not necessarily equal.\n2. The first criterion states that the angles between the alternate (opposite) sides of the triangle must be equal for two triangles to be congruent. This means that the sides of the two triangles must also be equal, but it is not necessary for the angles to be equal as well.\n3. The second criterion is a mathematical relationship that says that if the sides of two triangles are not equal but are proportional to each other, then the triangles are still congruent.\n3. This is because they have the same shape and all the other properties (intersecting lines, etc.) are the same, then the triangles must be congruent.

P= [(120-100)/120] x 100 = 20%\n   This shows that the average percentage difference between the crane and the building is 20%.\n\n   Note: The answer is 20%, not 22.22%, as the answer is the average of the difference and does not account for rounding errors.\n2: Use a ratio formula - Ratio calculation:\n   Given that the first crane is 228 ft/200 ft = 1.14 and the second crane is 120 ft/100 ft = 3/2 = 1.5\n. The ratio of cranes to buildings is (1.14:3/2)=1.08:1.5. So the difference between the two ratios is 1.5:1.08 = 1.3953.

If a dog can reach the middle of a hallway in ten seconds, how much time does a dog have left to be safe from a cat?\nOutput: A dog is a carnivore. In order for a cat to catch a dog, it would have to first be at the end of the hall and then catch the dog. This doesn't seem physically possible, so the answer would be: a dog would have to be faster than a cat to be safe from a catch.\n\nInput: There are two people in a room. The door to the hallway is open, but the door connecting the hallway to the staircase is closed. The door connecting a hallway to the stairs will not open when its door is open, so if it were open, you wouldn't be able to enter it. If you do not enter it, it will remain that way until both of the hallways doors are closed.\nOutput: The door to the staircase can remain open while someone is in the hallway if both of the hallway's doors are closed, but if the door to the staircases is closed and the hallway door is open, the hallway door can't be closed.\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following grade math question in 3 hours or less without the use of a computer.\n\nInput: In a class of 50 students, there are 23 children who like football.

If it were a whole number, then we could say it is even if it is evenly divisible by 2. However, since we have a comma-separated decimal, we will need to calculate the remainder in order to check if the number is even.\n2: To calculate the remainder, we take 1,00,00,0,00 as the operand of our division, and 2 as the divisor. In mathematical notation, this is represented as 1,00 0,00 00 \u00f7 2. The remainder is equal to 1,00\n\n3: 1,00 is not an even number, because it is divisible by 2 with a remainder.

This does not provide enough context to answer the question, as it doesn't tell us how much each individual weighs before or after they get on the scale.\nTo address this, we need to add more information to the question. Let's assume that each person is 1-pound scale accurate. This means that if the scale says Jim weighs 200 pounds, then it's likely that he actually weighs at least 200 pounds and possibly as much as 10 pounds more or less than that.\nWith this in mind, we can answer the question by subtracting Jim's weight of 110 pounds from the total scale weight, which would be the total of Stan's, Steve's, and Jim's weights. This would tell us that Stan, Steve, Jim, and the scale together would weigh a total of 240 pounds.\nInput:Fifty-three percent of women are right-handed.

We can simplify the problem to:\n   Jess must walk 3 blocks to arrive at work\n3. To figure out how many more blocks she has to walk, we can start with the total distance (11 + 6 + 8) = 25. This means she still needs to walk 25 - 3 = 22 blocks to arrive at work from her current location. And so her total walk is 11 + 22 = 33 blocks.\n4. So, the final answer is 33 blocks and this has been calculated using the basic math formula for distance traveled:\nDistance = (Starting point) + (Destination) - (Current position)\nSo we've got:\nDistance = 11 + 8 -6\nGiven that distance is equal the total walk, so we have:\nDistance = 25 - 6\nDistance = 22\nSo we've simplified the problem and have the answer 33 blocks.

The question does not specify how many people will be in each car, but will be running it.\u00a0 It does say that each car can hold 2 people. So, we can assume that each person gets their own car. So, 84 people can fit in 84 cars with 2 people in each car. This would mean that the roller coaster would run 42 times to fit everyone in.\n  4. D: Since we have 84 people, 42 people per roller coaster run is required for everyone to have a turn.

{"idx": 594, "text": "The problem is asking for the depth of a snowdrift over a four-day period, and then the snowdrift is 34 inches deep in the fourth day. The goal is to figure out how deep the drift was at the end of the very first day.\nThere are three rules to simplify the math: Rule of three, rule of four, and rule of five:\n\n- Rule 1: A number raised to the first power is equal to itself.\n- Rule 2: A number raised to a second power is equal to the first number squared.\n- Rule 3: A number raised to 3rd power is equal to the number times itself multiplied by itself.\n- Rule of 4: A number raised to fourth power is equal to the fourth raise to the second power.\n- Rule of Five: A number raised to fifth power is the same as itself squared.\n\nNow, we need to do the math:\n\n1. The drift was 34 inches at the end of the 4th day.\n2. The first day, the drift was 4/4=1 inch deep. (rule of 4 is 4 raised to 2nd power = 22)\n3. The second day, the drift would be 4/52 = 1/.48 inch deep.\n4. The third day, the drift is 16/53 = 1/.028 inch deep. And\n5.

So, let us find out how many shells Jacob collected: \n      (i) If Jacob found only one shell, then he collected 6 shells to get to a total of 22 shells.\n      (ii) Now if Jacob found at least two shells, then the difference must be more than one. We can either say that Jacob found 4 shells and that Ed collected only 2 to get to a total collection of 6, or that Jacob found 21 shells and Ed collected only one.\n      (iii) Now, since we know the answer, the only way it could be 21 shells is if Jacob only found one shell, and Ed also found one. This means Ed found one shell and Jacob found 21.\n   d. So, this means that, with Ed finding one shell, they have 67 shells.\n   e.

If you buy four gallons of each kind of gas, how much money will you save by buying the regular gas instead of the premium?\nOutput: 4th quart. Save is $20.\n\n2. Given the price of gas is $1.20 less the normal gas, and then $2 gallons less the premium gas, we would save $0.24 per quart of normal (and $2 per quart for premium).\n3. Thus, the answer is $0.24 (from 4 quarts of regular gas = $20 of savings).\n\nInput: In a recent election, a single ballot was marked incorrectly.

In this case we have 3 pencils.\n   Cent: The term cent represents the units of currency. In this case the currency is 20 cels as we started out of the question.\n   Dollar: The term dollar represents the value of the currency in dollars. In this case we started out with $0.20 as the initial dollar value.\n   Stationery shop: The term stationery shop shows you where the pencils are being bought from. It\u2019s a store that is selling pencils.\n\n2- The question is \u201cHow much will they spend collectively at the stationery shop?\u201d. It also asks how much they spend in dollars. From our definition, what they spend in dollars in the stationery shop is the value of X and the value of Y. For X, we can write the following equation: $ 0.20 x 3 = X $. Y is written as: $0.20 x (3 + 5 + 2) = Y $\n3 - Therefore, 0.20x(t+b+z) = (4 x100) + C which gives us: $ 0.60x (t+b+z)= 400 $. t is equal to 3, b to 5, and z to 2, giving us: Y = $100 + 15 + 100 = $265\nSo the final answer in dollars is $265 as requested.\n\nInput: There are 20 students in an English class.

However, we must use the information we have to find it.\n4) First, we can think about it this way: if Grayson is 2 inches tall than Gracie, what does that mean? It means that Gracie is 2 inches shorter than Grayson(i.e. if Grayson is 8 feet tall, Gracie is 6 feet tall).\n5) Now, let's take Grayson's height and see what we can do with it: Grayson's height is 8 feet. That makes Gracie's age(height) 6 foot.\n6) Now let's combine the two equations and substitute into the question. We can see, Gracy's height(i.e. age) is 7 inches.\nSo, the final answer is Gracy is 7 inches tall\n\nInput: Sally spent $2 for a pack of three cheese strings.

Choices: A: 10 B: 11 C: 12 D: 13 E: 14\nOutput:  The question asks us to evaluate the expression \"x+6 = 2x-3\" in the context of the equation. We plug in different values for \"x\" and solve for the equation.\n\n1. One option is to let \"x\" equal 10. We then find \"x plus 6\" equals \"2x minus 3\" and substitute in the values. So, 10+6=16= 2(10-3). So, 10 is a valid value of x\n2. Next, let's try and let \"x\" equal to 11. We then find \"6=2(11-3). We can also see \"x plus 6=2x-3\" is equivalent to \"x=6+3\" or \"x=9.\" However, a solution \"x=9\" does not make sense in the given scenario, as there is no place for a missing value in \"10+6=2(x-3).\n3. So, we can eliminate answer choices B: \"11\" and C: \"12\" as they do not provide an answer for \"10+6.\"\n\n4. The number \"13\" can be a valid answer for the scenario, but we need to show our working for it. So, we start with \"x + 6 = 2x - 3\" so we can just factor out 2 from both sides and then divide both sides by 6 and we get x = 13/2 and so that makes B: \"13\" as the correct answer.", "answer": " 96"}

So, the equation of this problem can be formulated as follows:\n  _x_ = 1e4 * 0.1= 10,000\n  _y_ = 1000, since he buys 10,0\n  _z_ = 0.3, since he gets a 30 percent discount\n  _x_/100 = _y_ + _z_, so the equation is:\n  x = 1e4 - y + z\n  x = 0.7e4 + 0.3y\n3) Plugging the values of x, y, and z in, this equation becomes:\n  x = (0.7e4 - y + 0.3)*10000\n  x = 7000e4 - 7000 - 300y, where y = 100\n  x= 7000000 - 700300 - 3e4\n  x= 69956100 - 7e4\n  x = 69955800\n  Therefore, Johnny pays 6995,580 for 1e4 ping-pong balls.\n\nInput:\nA farmer has 85 apples.

If I calculate 0.2*${price}$ I get 0.2*4 which equals 0.2*22 which equals 4.4 dollars.\n            TOTAL = 22 + 4.4\n            TOTAL 22+4.4\n              TOTAL=A\n               \n   Step 2: Calculate the difference in price if Trevor takes a Lyft trip compared to if he takes a taxi trip.  If I'm comparing the price of an Uber trip of $22 compared to a taxi trip of $22 + 4 = $26 I get a price of $22-$26 which equals -4 dollars.\n            Step 1=\n            TOTAL=22-4\n                TOTAL = 18\n  Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total costs of the Uber and Lyft rides. if I assume the Uber ride cost is $22 then  $22-$22 = 0 dollars.\n               \nTOTAL = 23 + 18.

The answer we give from the question is the profit from selling. To find the profit, we subtract the cost price from selling price. The cost price is $100 and the selling price is $80, so the profit is ($80 - $100) = -$20\n\nOption B: The loss is ($100 - 80) = -$100.

{"idx": 739, "text": "1. The question is about Tom Sawyer tricking his friends into whitewashed Aunt Polly'st fence, which implies that all of their work might be for nothing if the friends can't finish the job.\n2. We can break down each friend's work, with Tom doing nothing and all friends doing 10% each. This gives us the following information:\n   Tom worked nothing\n   Ben worked 10%\n   Billy worked 20%\n   Johnny worked 30%\n3. As for the work remaining, we can apply proportions to determine how much is left. Here's the calculation: \n   Ben's section was 10/100, or 10%, of the total fence. This means that 90% of the fence is still remaining. \n   Billy's section was 5/100, since you have to multiply 20/100 times the number of parts already done. This means that 5% of the fence. is already whitewashed. This leaves 95% of the fencing still requiring work.\n   Johnny's section was 3/100, as per the calculation above. This implies 3% of the fence has been whitewashed, while 97% remains.\nTherefore, to answer the question, we add up the percentage of work already done by each friend and subtract it from the total percentage of the fence. This gives us:\n\nTom - 0% + Ben - 10% + Billy - 10%+ Johnny - 3% = 23% of the fense left to whitewash\nSo the final answer to the question is: \n\n23 % of the fence still need to be whitewashed\n\n#Program to implement the solution\n\ndef solution(question1,question2):\n  answer=answer(question1,question1)\n  if answer=='Yes':\n    answer=1\n  else:\n    answer=0\n  return answer\n'''\n\nfrom __future__ import print_function\n\ndef parse_data(data):\n  def split_by_newline(x):\n    return x.split('\\n')\n      \n  def split_strings(x):\n    x=x.split('", "answer": " 48"}

However, the answerer has three chances to guess the object successfully. The answerer wins if and only if the answerer's first guess matches the object that the questioner is thinking of. Who won the game? Choices: 1. Answerer won\n2. Questioner won\n3. Neither of them won\n4. Questioner win\n\n\n5.Let's go through the possible answers:\n  1: Questioner won - Since the game is based on guessing the correct answer, the person who guesses the correct answer wins. So, since the questioner has the option to describe the object they are thinking of, the questioner has the ability to determine who wins the game. Therefore, the answer is 1.\n  2: Answerer won - In this case, the answerer wins if their first guess is correct. The questioner does not describe what they are thinking of, so the answerer has no option to describe the object to increase their chances of success. So, if the questioner guesses incorrectly, this person loses the game and is unable to take advantage of future efforts. Based on this information, the answer is 2.\n\n  3: Neither of them won - In this scenario, neither the questioner nor the answerer can earn a victory. The questioner needs to describe what they are thinking, but the answerer cannot take advantage of this information. Since neither party has an advantage, neither can be declared the winner. Therefore, the answer chosen is 3.\n\n  4: Questioner won -The fact that the questioner always has the option to describe what they are looking for makes them the best player. If they are able to correctly guess what the object is, they can avoid future games and claim victory over the answerer. Therefore, the answer 4.\n\n### Solution:\nThe solution code looks like this:\n\n```", "answer": " 106000"}

We've described the scenario, now we can begin to think about a strategy to approach the question. One approach is to first calculate the difference in travel times, and then subtract one. This gives the amount of time Yolanda has been on the road, and is the solution to the question.\n3. Let's calculate how far Yolanda has traveled in 15 minutes:\n\n    # Calculate Yolanda's speed: Yolanda leaves home for her biking route at 20 miles/hour.\n    # Calculate the distance she travels: 15 minutes later, that's 15*.20 = 3 miles\n\n    # Subtract 3 miles from 7 miles which is Yolanda's starting point to calculate number if minutes Yolanda had travelled in 15 mins: 7-3 = 4\n\nNext, from there:\n\n    # Let a = the difference between Yolanda's time and her husband's time.\n    # We can calculate this by subtracting both Yolanda and husband's time, but subtracting Yolanda by herself first:\n    ((-4)+a)\n\n    # ((-4)+a)= a = Yolanda's husband travels at 40 miles/hour. So, Yolanda travels at -40%. He should travel faster.

If 90% are male, how many are male?\nOutput:  The question is asking how many people at the convention center are male. To get the answer, we need to find the proportion of people who are male. First, let's note that 90% of the people are male, so the total number of males we consider is 386 people or 0.9*86\nThen we multiply 0.9*1 by 100 to get our answer. Since 86 is the total number of people at the convention center, 90% of them are male.\nInput:A certain kind of cheese has a production life of 9 months. A 25 pound block of cheese costs $45.

This means she will need to prepare 30 batches of her chosen recipe.\n   We also know that 2 batches make a serving and that each batch requires 4 potatoes and one teaspoon of sodium chloride.\n   Finally, we know that each potato costs $0.10 and each teaspoon of the salt in a large container costs $2.\n\n3. So from the above, we can conclude that Susan will need to serve 30 dishes with 2 servings for each, using 30 potatoes and 1.5 servings of salt for each, totalling 1500 grams for a cost of $0.15 per batch ($2 / 1.5).\n\nWe know that Susan also needs 5 teaspoonfuls of salt from a container, which holds 5 teaspoonsof salt and costs $2.

{"idx": 768, "text": "1. This is a ratio and proportion word problem, so you'll need to identify the ratios and proportions involved and then use them to answer the question.\n2. To do this, you'll need to first break down the information into separate smaller problems to make them easier to solve. This means making two different equations to represent the proportion and ratio of the kids on the Lake Pleasant trip.\n3. To find the ratios, use the phrase \"for every X, there are X + 1 total.\" This could be 4 (X value) : 1 (X + 1 total).\n4. To find the proportions, you divide each of the numerator by the denominator to find the fraction. In this case, 4 (X value)/1 (X + 2 total) = 4/1\n\n5. So the two main equations you'll need to solve this problem are:\n  (X + 1)/1 = 4/1 (for the proportion)\n  (4 + 1)/4 = 5/4 (for the ratio)\n\n6. Using the information in the problem, we can fill in the X and X + 2 values to get two equations that look like this:\n   X + 1 = 4\n   (X + 1) + 1 = 5\n\n7. Subtracting the second equation by the first, we get:\n   X = 3\n   (X +1) = 4\n\n8. To answer the question, you'll need the ratio with two different denominators. If you divide the numerator by the first denominator, you have the fraction 3/1. However, this doesn't help us with the second denominator from the question.\n\n9. So you can rewrite the fraction as 3/(1 + 2) to get 3/3, which is equal to 1.\n\n10. Adding the two fractions, we have 1/1 + 1/3 = 2/3, which satisfies the original question. So you could say that 2/3 of the kids who came on the rafting excusion were also on the tubbing excusion.\nSo the final ans is : 2/3", "answer": " 5"}

The question asks what the width of the beach is in centimeters.\nTo answer the question, we first need to find the dimension of the beach chair which is the width and the length of the rectangle. We can use the formula `area*width/length = length` to find out the width of the beach.\nHere, we have two variables \u2013 area and width so we will use the subtraction method to find out the width. `area = length width = [(length / width)*width] = 20 feet 66 yards 1111 square cm`Now, we can subtract `20 ft* 66 yds = 1320 sq ft` to find the width of the beach which is `1111 - 13", "answer": " 165"}

We can interpret this question to refer to the total number of students who can be accommodated within the school regardless of the actual seating arrangements, provided that everyone has their own personal desk. In other words, the question asks for the maximum number of students that can be accommodated in the school given that they all have their own desk.\n3. To solve this problem, we can first count the total number of desks in the school. This gives us a total of (15 x 30) = 450 desks. We now substract the total number of desk that do not have enough space for 1 student. There are 30 desks that can easily fit 2 students so it gives us a total 420 - 2 x 30 = 390 free desks for students\n4. If we know that there are 101 desks that fit 1 student, we can calculate the number of students that can fit by dividing the number of desks that can fit 1 student by the number of students per desk (a total of 101 desk \u00f7 1 = 101 students per desks) and we can see that this gives us a total of 390 free students + 101 students = 491 students\n\nInput: What 4 letter word can be read forward backward and still remain the same word?\n\nOutput:1.

To approach this problem from a different perspective, we can focus on the rules and see what letter we need to maintain for a word to be a palindrome.

The question then asks him to calculate the total cost of both items.\n3. First, we need to find the cost of the bed frame after the discount. The base price of the bed frame is $100, and we'll subtract the 20% discnt because when you buy something for $100, after 20% off, you only pay $80: $100*(100%-20%) = $100*(80%)= $80\nSo $80 is the cost without the discount.\n\nThen, let's find the price of the bed:\nThe base price of the bed is 11 times the base price of the bed frmework, or $1100.

So James pays a total of $1160 after the discount for the bed and bed frame.\nSo the final ans is B: $1160.", "answer": " 660"}

The question is asking about the total money collected by Margaux, who owns a money lenders after 7 days.\n\n### Hints:\nI'll begin this question by stating that it's not asking about the amount of money accumulated per person. Instead, it's asking about the total revenue for Margaux at the end of 7 days.\n2. I'll break down each person's contribution to Margaux:\n3. Margaux's friend pays Margaux $5 per day, totaling $35 after 7 days. This would be 13 for the first day total and 5 for the last 6 days.\n4. Margaux's brother pays Margaux $8 per day, totaling to $56 after 7 days. \n5. Finally, Margaux's cousin pays Margaux $4 per day, totaling 30 after 7 days. We start at 6 for the first day and 7 for each remaining day.\n6. There are 3 separate individual contributions made from 3 people. In total, after 7 days of loaning money out, Margaux's income will be $16 per day for a total of $112 per week.\n7. Therefore, the final answer is $112.\n\nInput:Floyd is the manager of the local baseball team and offers players various amounts of money to compete with specific skill levels. What offer will provide the most revenue to Floyd and why? \n\nOutput: 3. The question is asking which dollar amount will provide the most rewards to Floyd, who is the manager of the team, through skill levels. \n\n### Hint:\nI'll start by identifying the options:\n2. $0 is not an option, as this will be less than $15. This means that this is not a valid answer.\n3. Similarly, $15 is not the correct answer. $15 is below the second and third options, so it's not sufficient to provide the most revenue.\n4. Based on this analysis, the only correct answer is \"20\", which provides 60+120+100 = 320. \nSo, the final answer is \"20\".\n\nInput:Sales of car is down", "answer": " 119"}

{"idx": 906, "text": "Here's what I think:\nFirst, we'll start by defining \"machine\". I think of a machine as a physical object that can produce an item and then stops. This is different from a continuous process like a soda dispenser that produces more soda as needed and doesn't stop.\nLet's say \"machine\" actually means a physical object that produces an item and then stops and doesn't produce any more items or materials. If it works that way, then we'll need to use 8 * (30 minutes / 30 seconds) to figure out how many cans a machine can produce during an hour, then we'll then multiple that by 8 to find out how many it produces every day.\n1. (30 minutes /30 seconds) = 10 (minutes per hour)\n2. 10 * 8 = 80 (minutes in a day)\n3. 80 * (how many machines are in a factory) = 6400 (cans in a day)\n4.

{"idx": 910, "text": "The question is asking for the total number of animals in a compound where there are 16% fewer cats than dogs and twice as many frogs.\n\n1. To answer the question, start by examining the percentage changes:\n   Cats: 20% less\n   Dogs: unknown\nFrogs: 100% more\n2. Assuming that the percentages hold true when calculating the total number of animals, we can then calculate the total number as follows:\n   Cats = dogs \u00d7 100% - 20%\n   Dogs = cats \u00d7 100 - 100% + 100%\n   Frogs = dogs \u00d7 125%\n\n3. Plugging numbers into the calculations and simplifying, we get the following:\n   Cats (dog-side) = dogs \u00d7 (100% -20%)\n   Dogs (cat-side) = dogs * (100 - 20%) + (100% * 125%)\n   Frogs (dog-side)\n   Frogs = (dogs * (100%)) / 2 * 125% * 2 = ( (dogs * (250%)) / 4) * 62.5% * 2\n\n4.  Combining the final equations, we can see that we are looking for:\n   Dogs (dog-side): (dogs * ( (250%)))) / 4) * (125% *2) = frogs * dogs x 62.5%)\n   Dogs = frogs * (33.3%)\n   Cats (cat-side): (cats * (100 % -20 %)) = frogs * cats * (17.5%)\n   Cats = frogs * (17.666 % * 0.5%) = frogs * (9.3 %)\n\n5.

{"idx": 927, "text": "The question asked how much Bailey will spend on towel sets, so we need to find the total cost of the towel sets.\n\nTo calculate the cost of the towel set, we can use the equation: [cost of towel set] = [number of towels in set] x [price of each towel].\n\nFor the guest bathroom set, we know the number of towels is 2 and the price is $40.0\nWe know the number of towel in the master bathroom set 4 and the price is $50\n\nTherefore, the cost of the guest bathroom is [2x40] = $80.00 and the cost of the master bathroom set = [4 x $50] = $200\nBy multiplying the cost of the 2 sets [80+200] = $280, so we can answer [280] as the total cost of the 2 towel sets.\nSo the final cost is $280\nInput:A family of 4 is selling pound cakes at 10 for the price of each cake.  The family made 10 pound cakes. Which expression of multiplication and division represents the cost to a family member if 5 cakes cost the family $8.00?\nOutput:This question asks for the cost to a family when 5 cakes are sold. To calculate the cost, we use the equation cost = amount sold x price. So, [cost] = [number of items sold] x [price].\n\nIn this scenario, there are 4 family members making pound cakes for $10 a piece. They sell 10 cakes (4 x 10), so the total cost is 4 * 10 = $40\n5 cakes, or 1/2 of the total number of cakes, cost the family $8, which means [divide the answer by 5 for each cake sold] = $8.00/5 = $1.60 per cake\nSo the final answer for [the cost] = $40", "answer": " 224"}

{"idx": 936, "text": "1. The question asks how many loaves of bread Jim can bake with his current flour supply. One way to solve this problem is to work backwards. Let's say we want to make two loaves. Then, we'll need a two-to-one ratio of flour to water.\n   This means we'll need 400g of flore for each 2 loaves, and 200g for each one loaf.\n2. So, we can use the ratios to determine how many loaves we can bake given the amount of flour available:\n   Given that one loaf requires twice as much flour as one gallon of water, we can determine that:\n     1 loaf = 400g to 200g\n     2 loaves = 800g to 400g\n     3 loaves = 1200g to 600g\n     4 loaves = 1600g to 800g\n3. Based on the above calculation, Jim can bake:\n     1 loaves (200g per loaf)\n    2 loaves (400g per loa\n     3 loaves (600g per loai\n     4 loaves (800g per loav\n\n4.

{"idx": 958, "text": "So we can ask the question as it was:\nQuestion:  A charcoal grill is used to make grilled meat, which requires the use of coals to create the heat needed to cook food. In a charcoal grill, there are generally 60 coals per bag, which can burn for about 15 to 20 minutes per bag. The grill ran long enough to burn three of these bags, which means that the charcoal grill was operating for about 45 to 60 minutes.\nAnd answer the qeustion as it was:\n1. The question asks how long a charcoal grille is operated, given that the grill burned three bags of coeals and each bag contains 60 coeals.\n2. We can go through the options:A: 30 minutes - This does not accurately represent the amount of time the grill ran. The question specifically asks how long the grill ran, not how long it took to burn the three bags of coelas.\nB: 60 minutes - This is an option that is accurate in terms of time, but does not account for the number of bags used. If three bags were burned, then the grill ran for 45-60 minutes, not 60 minutes. So, this is not the correct answer.\nC: 120 minutes - This option is not accurate. It does not consider the amount of time it took the grill to burn one or more bags, but rather how long it might run if it were burning an indefinite amount of coelas. The question specifically asks about how long the grill runs when operating. So, it' s not the right answer. \nD: 90 minutes - This answer is potentially correct, considering the time it took to burn all three bags. However, it requires more assumptions to determine how long the grill was really run, since the question does not ask about the exact amount of time it took to burn each bag of coal.\n3.

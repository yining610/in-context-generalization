In this case, a total of $27 was gained in addition to the value of the crafts that were sold. $20 to be exact, $10 dollars is the value of the craft sold.

{"text": "The total cost at the grocery is $60.00 where at the bulk warehouse it is $12.08 (see [calculation](#calculation here)). So the difference is $58.00. Dividing by the number of cans it becomes $48 per case where multiplying by 12 cans per case there is $576 per case; $12 multiplied by 12 the number of cans.\n\n### Input The amount of money spent in the store.\n\n### Solution: \nIn this problem we are given 2 different cases where we need to compare how expensive is buying 12 cans of sparkling waters from each place, one at a bulk warehouse and the other\nat a local grocery.\n\nFirst we do the calculation by hand where we find that at the warehouse it costs\n$12.00 per case, where as at the grocery it only costs 6.00 per case. So this means\nthat instead of paying $12.0 it actually only costs $6 to buy the sparkling water at\nthe grocery, which in this case is $6.00-.12=$5.88.\n\nThis now means that the grocery is saving $6.00 at first glance.\n\nBut in order to compare the costs of 12 cans we do as follows:\n\n$$12 x 6.00=72.00$$\n\nWhich means that we would have saved $576 if we bought our cans from the grocery\nstore instead of the other.\n\n\n## Calculation:\nThe input says that there are $48 cans of water for $12 and another one is about $6 a case.\n\nWe look at the second one first, which is $6 for 12 cans or $6.00.\nSo we divide $12 by $6 to get how many cans you are getting for each dollar.\nBy doing this we get 12/6 which simplifies to $2.00 per can.\n\nAs we did for dividing we can also use multiplication to simplify to say that the second\ncase is $12 times $2 to get $24 for each", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": "3*(1/2)(6/7) = 12.44  \n2443266.40 = 667\n### Discussion: The first thing we need to do is eliminate all of the options that have incorrect math.  Options B, C, and E contain math that does not work.  They each calculate to a value that is much higher than the given answer.  We can rule them out and move on.\n\nNow that the options that are incorrect have been removed, we need to evaluate the remaining options.  How much time has each cat had? In option A, the first cat meows for 3 minutes, then the second cat meows for 6 minutes.  That works out to be 2/5 of the total time.  Option C contains a lot of math, but it appears that it is calculating how much time the second cat meows instead.  If A and C are eliminated, we're left with option D, which is the most similar to what we're looking for.\n\nNext, we need to evaluate what value is being multiplied by the cats' meow times.  Option D indicates that the cats are meowing at different frequencies and we need to figure out what each time value is.  Option A says that the cats are 3 times more frequent, which means option A divided by option B and the result is 2.  Option C says that the cats' meows are even, which divided by 7 means the result is 1.43.  If the meows are even then each cat's meow is 2/7ths each.  Lastly, option E says the cats have the same overall frequency, so the answer should be.4.\n\nThis gives us (3*2/5 + 1*1.43 +.4) = 1.6029.  If we divide this by 12 to get minutes, we get 1.3333, which ends up being closer to the given answer of 3 minutes than option D's 3 minutes is.  We also need to figure out how many times the cats meow per cycle of the moon.  The average moon cycle is 29.53 days, which means the cats meow 3 times in the 5 minute period.", "answer": " 55"}

Let's say she has to use the elevator when she goes to and from her office, so we can count 9 flights of them up (5 times the total of 9) and 9 flights of down (3 times total of 9). So that would be 9 up and 9 down. But the flights that are up from 1 and down count twice, so that is 5 and 3 times. 5 times 9 is 45, and 3 times 9 is 27, and 45 + 27 is 72.\n\nBut according to the choice the answer is 73. There is no 74th floor to be considered so the answer is 72. \n\n### Note\n1. The elevators have stops at floors below and above. \n2. Stops at each and every floor \n3. When we use elevators, we walk, and walk count as flights. \n4. We can apply 1. for every stop (floor) where she is getting in and out of the elevator. \n5.

{"text": "The amount of money required to shoot Janet's entire movie is 900.\n\n### Rationales:\n(1) The previous movie cost $5 per minute to shoot. The new one costs twice as much, meaning it costs $10 per minute. From here we want to use that to find what the new film cost $1 hour to film, so we have $10*60 = $600 for 1 hour. If there was a total of 60% more time to film, we multiply that by the cost of per minute, which equals to $1*0.6=60 cents. Using the total amount of time with $600 and added the $60 cents, the answer ends up being $600 + $60 = $660. (2) We have a base of 50 per minute, and then our new one costs 2x. So 50+2*2 = 100. Then we have a 60% increase, which equals to 160%. So we start by taking our original 100 and multiply it by 1.6. So that's 100*1.6 = 160. So the total equals 50 + 2*(100) + 0.6*160 = 660 total money. (3) 40% of time + % is (40 + 100)/100 =.6. So 600+.6 is 666, which rounds down to 660.

{"text": "Answer: B (6 trees)\n\nWe assume that each tree is actually a plant and each plant is actually a tree.

Then we take this number and divide by the total number of plants which is 120 and we multiply that by 2 to get the number of trees. The total number of trees is 6 trees.\n\nAnswer: A (21 trees)\n\nWe do the same thing as in the last question, but we see there are now 60 seeds instead and each plant is a tree now. Now we do: 60% *20 = 12 plants for each tree to start with. 12 * 2 = 12 trees altogether.\n\nAnswer: D (16.5 trees)\n\nWe first count the plants, then divide that number by how much it was multiplied by. Then we multiply that by two and we have two.\nAnswer: B (5 trees)\n\nSame as last two questions, but 100% this time. So we take 100% * 2 = 2 then multiple by two more. We have 3 seeds so we multiply 3 by 2 to get 6 since we have plants. Then we have 96% (5 trees * 19 = 96%). 6 * 96% = 5.44. Since that is no more than 5 trees, we need to round down to 5 trees to make the answer.\n\nAnswer: C (16 trees)\n\nSlightly different than previous question. We multiply 90% by 20 (20% of 9 plants). This gives us 18. There is also an additional percent: 19% * 30 (trees planted = 19 trees) for a total of 396%: 36 + 19 = 55. Multiply that by 2 and we have 290 trees.

This is because 1100/60 = 18.66 seconds is 20 seconds. So that in that time 20 seconds she can finish eating the 26th hotdog and start on her 27th hotdog.\n\nAfter 8 minutes and 42 seconds, which is 10mins - 30 seconds, Lisa will be able to finish eating her 27th Hotdog and start on her second 28th hotdog.\nAfter 9mins and 10 seconds Lisa will be able to eat her 28th and 29th hotdog.\nHalfway through (meaning 5mins into the challenge) Lisa is 20 hotdings into the challenge and has 8 hotdogs to go before she can end the challenge and 8 minutes and 5 seconds to eat until she can tie Joey Chestnuts record.\n\nAt this point Lisa needs to eat 2 hotdogs every second for the final 8 minutes and 3 seconds to tie the world record, in order to eat 26 more hotdogs to tie Joey Chestnu's record.\n1) If you can get to the point where you need to eat 2 hotogs within every second, then it becomes a lot easier to eat 20 more hotdogs.\n2) Each hotdog you can eat before the end of the first mintue makes you even closer to the world record.\n```\n\n### Instructions:Sarah is a fan", "answer": " 11"}

{"text": "She'll receive $4\n\n### Input and Process\n\nThe example question is a little tricky. I hope you have the patience to try and find the correct answer, as I will guide you through how I answered my question.\n\nThe question has three parts. First, $1 for the first ticket. Second, $2 for the second ticket. The 3rd ticket is actually free as there's nothing more to be sold, as she sells them at $1 more than the previous ticket price. Each successive ticket is free after the 3rd with nothing being purchased by the 5th ticket, so the final price is $1 for the first one sold, $2 for the 2nd, $3 for the 3rd, $4 for the 4th, and $5 for the 5th.\n\nNow that we have the price of each ticket, let's look at the part where it says \"each successive ticket for a DOLLAR more. \" So each successive ticket is $2 more, which means that the 3rd ticket is sold for $3. It's free, but each successive ticket is another $2 after that.\n\nNow that each successive ticket is doubled in price, let's look closer to the end of our question to decide what amount of money the winner gets. Our prize starts at $5. As there's only four tickets left for sale, we know that the winner of each of the first 4 tickets will receive a prize of $5 each.\n\nAll that's left to determine is the last ticket. She'll give up $4 to the winner. The question already tells us that the 5th ticket is $5. So the last ticket is worth $5 and it already makes $1, leaving $5-$1 or $4.\n\nThis is what we are looking for.

It is not about the year so you cannot use any of the options \"in year\". This means that your answer is based on the school year.\n\nTo figure out the answer, you need to determine how many sandwiches are made in the school year. This can be determined by taking 36 weeks in the school year. You will also need to determine the dates when the sandwiches are missed. You know that Jackson didn't miss any Wednesdays or Friday sandwiches so you can say that there are no sandwiches missed on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.

{"text": "The answer to this question is 30 minutes.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. First, we need to calculate the total time that was spent assembling and producing Widgets. There were 68 Widgets assembled in 8 total hours, which is 8 / 60 = 0.125 (or less than an hour) per Widget.\n2. Now we need to figure out how long it took for each worker to finish a single Widget. Since Jack and Sam each finish in less time than the other, we'll split that 0.12 (one widget per hour) into smaller fractions of time. This gives: Jack - 0.19, Sam - 0.1, and Tony - 0.1.\n3. Let's break the time down some more, with the assumption that Sam and Jack each work equally. Then, Sam finishes 8 / 10 minutes faster than Jack.\n4. Jack finishes 4 times as fast as Tony, which is 4 (.12 +.08) / 10.\n5. As Sam finishes 2 times faster than Jack, it's fair to assume they work at 6 minutes per Widget.\n6. So Jack finishes one Widget in 7.5 minutes and Sam finishes in 3 minutes.\n7. Tony finishes 3 Widgets in 30 minutes, or 3 Widgets for 10 minutes each, or 3 (10 + 10 + 1) Widgets in 20 minutes.\n8. This means it takes Tony 30 minutes to produce 1 Widget.\n9. So, the sum of the times for each worker to make a Widget is 51 / 11 min. (37.5 = 51 / 6.5)", "answer": " 30"}

In 3 years Eustace will be in Milford's 14th grade or 3rd year of high school. Therefore Milford will have to be 15 in the 4th grade in 3 years. That makes Milford 12 in 3 years.

In his family, 9-2=7 children which is the max and total number of people and 7 grand children which is equal to the 9-2= 7 family.\nSo the first grandson would be Josh and since we know that he has grand kids, we can call max's grand children total by 9-2 grand children.\nLet's keep doing this for the rest 7 children to make max have total 8 grand kids.\nAmy has 3 grand children and Amy has the same as well if we were to add up. So amy would be the next grand child,\nThis process would follow for every child and the total would be for all grand children 7+3+2=12\n\nThose two children that only has 5 children, means they only have 5 grand children each.\nThe 2 children each count the 5 grand kids for the total of 2 grand kids,\nWe know max has total of 8 grand kids so max total grand children is 8+2= 10.\nThus max has 10 total grand children,\n\n### Output:Max has 8 grand children.

The clock angles are as follows: 360\u00b0, 30\u00b0, 15\u00b0, 10\u00b0, 7\u00bd\u00b0, 6\u00b0, 4\u00bd\u00b0, 3\u00b0, 1\u00bd\u00b0, and \u00bd\u00b0.\n3.

The first consideration is to understand the structure of the question, which is a standard math question, but with a wordy introduction at the beginning. Then the question becomes, how much does Harrison spend on two different types of croissants a year. So it's clear that the calculation only includes the amount spent on croissants during the specified time period. Hence, we can eliminate the choice -$525 as it is negative which cannot be the answer.\n2. Next, we can eliminate choice $37.16 because it is not a decimal but a number, so it cannot be the actual numerical answer to the question.\n3.

{"text": "The renovation of the house took 80 hours.\n\n### Process: The input asks the question \"How long did everything take?\" And the question contains the answer as follows: the kitchen took 50% more than each bedroom and the living room took 2x as much time as everything combined. When there are conditions given, the first step that needs to be taken for solving a math riddle is to determine the conditions, in other words, to determine the variables, to solve the math problem. In this case, there are 3 variables: the kitchen, the living room, and the bedrooms. Then we can proceed to consider the operations. The operation that is being performed on the living room is take twice as much time, and the operation that is being performed is percents divided by the multiplier (in this case 2x). Then we can proceed to perform the operation first, that is, multiplying the kitchen percents, and then dividing them by 2x, to evaluate how long the kitchen took. We can use basic math formulas to convert 50% to a percentage like this: 50/100 x 100 = 50%. Using this, we get from the living room, that 50% more is 1.5x. Next, we need to determine the variables for the bedrooms. We can use the basic formulas to determine 4/x because 4 is the operations given and x is the bedroom. We can proceed to divide the 4 by the x, and then combine it with 50/1. This formula can be combined to create x/2 + 50/2, where the 50/2 denotes the living room taking twice as much time as the remaining of everything combined, which is the bedrooms. Then, using division with the same variables, we can create 50/1 for the kitchen to evaluate how long the 50% takes. We then have x/2 + 1.5x + 50/1 which is equivalent to 2.5x + 1.5 +50/1= 6.5x+ 6.5+50/1. Then all we need to do is to evaluate with the given values. Therefore the formula we need is x=80hours.

After reading the question, the first thing we can do is list out all of the information we are given to review. Do so with the list provided above.We are given the following information:  (1)The number of bananas that everyone has (Dawn, Lydian and Donna) is 200  (2)Dawn has 40 more than her relative bananas than Lydian.

Looking at the three statements above, we discover that Lydian's bananas are 100 more than Dawn's Bananas and also 100 more that Dawn's than Donna's bananas, and hence Dawn is the one with half-bananas.2. Next, subtracting Dawn's bananas (40 more than Ldian's bananas) from 201 (the total bananas of the 3 people, given the fact that Dawn's banana + the two of Lydian and Donan) we discovered that Ldian's 60 bananas and Donna's banana (200- 40-40).3.

{"text": "Harry ran 30 meters per hour on Friday. From Tuesday through Thursday, Harry\u2019s average speed was 50% more than on Monday, so it was 2.5 times Monday\u2019s speed or 25 meters per hour. Then Harry ran 60% more than he ran on Thrusday, so his speed on Friday was 2.6 times Tuesday.\n\n### Rationale:\nWe are given the following data:\n```\nHe ran 10 meters on Monday. We can call this the base speed. He ran 50% more on Tuesday, so on that day he ran 15 meters per hour. He ran 60% of 15 meters per minute. We can call this his \u201cgoal,\u201d which we know is more than Monday\u2019s speed. His goal is 28.5 meters per hour, meaning that he needed to run 28.5/60 of his goal in order to meet his goal. (28.5/3/60 means every 3 minutes he had to go 28.5%. The goal of every 3 minutes was more than the goal overall, so he needed to go faster). He ran 2.6 of his goal speed on Thrusday, meaning he needed to run at 60% of his goal plus 60% of the goal plus 3/60 of the goal (because he missed a goal of 28.5). Harry\u2019s total speed equals Monday + (50% more Monday) + (60% more) + (2.6 of his \u201cgoal\u201d) = Monday + (2.5 * Monday) + (2.8 * his Monday) + (28.5 / 60) = Monday + (12.5 * Monday + 5.14 * his Monday) = Monday + 6.645 Monday.

{"text": "8 miles.\n\n### Explanation: The correct answer is 8 miles.  In the first part, it is clear that 2 hours of swimming at 2 miles per hour covers 4 miles.  The second part of the question indicates that Tom swims for half the time at twice the speed.  Since swimming is 2/5 as fast as running, it covers half as much as running in the same time.  Therefore, the combined swimming and running of 2/5 times as fast as the swimming alone covers 5 times as much.  When adding the swimming and running together, half of the running and half of the swimming adds up to 2 3/5 times as far as swimming alone, or 8 miles.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "Due to their being 40 kids, one fourth of these was 10 kids, half of whom went rafting. One fourth of the 10 rafters equals 2. Then, 1 out of 2 equals 50%. When you multiply 2 by 50 percent, you get an answer of 1. There, 40/1 or 40 equals 1, which is the answer.\n\n### Rationales: 1) In order to find the amount of kids who went tubing, you have to find the total amount of kids first. You know there were a total of 40 kids. The problem tells you that 40/4 equals 10. Therefore, the amount of kids that went tubing equals 10. This is because one fourth of the 40 kids were on tubing.\n\n2) Next, to find the amount of the rafters equal 10, so you multiply the kids who actually went tubing by a fraction that equaled half the amount of rafters, so 10 divided by 2 equals 5. Again, you were told that half were rafters. They were 5, but since they are just a fraction, you multiply 5 by 50 percent. One half of 5 rafters equals a fraction of 2.5, which is equal to 2.5. When you multiply 2.5 by 50, you get 1.25. Next, you square 1.25, which is 1.5625. Then, you add the amount of rafter 5 to this total to get 6.857. This is equal to the amount of kids.\n\n3) To find out how many rafters went tubing, you multiply 2 by fraction, but since you already know the rafters and the kids that went 10, you just add 10 and 2 at the end. 16.857 - 14 equals 2.75 rafters, and this is the answer.

All values are integers, and thus we know that any fractional value of an item has to be an integer: all the items are integers.\n2. We only need to know the number of pallets with which we're working with, and 20 because the value is divisible by the value of the items 1/2, 1/5, 1/4 and 1/5 to equal the sum of these values.\n3. Therefore we need to determine how many pallets with cups because there are 1/5 of the remaining pallets are cups. We can do a remainder division to determine the remainder, which should be 0 or 1 if it is not less than the denominator 5 of our quotient 5/3.\n4. The remainder tells us that we should have 3.25 pallets of cups, but since we cannot get a fraction, we could round down as 3.25/5 = 0.65, so we can say that we got as many as 4 pallets of cups.\n5.

{"text": "Allyn will be spending $96 in electricity bills this June.\n### Justification:\nThe first step is to calculate the usage of each bulb. Let's assume each bulb is used for a duration 60hours, which means one bulb would use 60watts of energy in a day.\nFor calculating the usage of all 40 bulbs, let's assume it is for a duration of 360hours. There are two ways of representing it:\n1. 360h = 1 week,40 x 1 watt bulbs = 40 x 60watt = 40x60h = 40h\nSo, 40h x 1 watt = 40 hours of usage of a single bulb each month. \n40 x 1 week = 40 x6 days x 1 watt each day = 60watt per day. 60watt is also the usage of a single bulbs in a day. \nNow, for all 40 bulb, they combinedly use 60w in a day so 60w x 40 bulb = 2400w used by all bulbs each day. \n2. 360 h = 2 weeks, 1 watt x 40 bulbs = 4 watts of energy consumed each week. \n 1 week = _day x watt_ = 7x4 = 28w\n 1 week x 4o watts per bulb = _7 week x 40 bull x 4 watts per bul = 160w.   \n160w x 2 weeks = 320w for two weeks or total 4 weeks = 32w watts per month. \n2. This makes us arrive at a final answer of 320w x 20c = 6400 watts in one month. To understand the answer, we have to multiply the total number of watts multiplied by the cost per watt of 20c.

Choices: A: 2 B: 5 C: 1 D: 3 E: 4\nRationales: Let's consider each option. \nA: 2- Since it takes two tries to get two heads, the odds of flipping 5 times and getting two heads is 1/16. Multiplying 1/16 times 5 and adding 1/16 yields 2/16 which is 2/2 to the first power, meaning 2 times itself equals 2. \nB: 5- Since it takes 5 tries to get two heads and 5 goes into 2 only once so 5/2 equals 2.\nC: 1- If the chance of getting two heads is 2/25 which means it can take only 1 tries to achieve 2 heads. Multiplying 2/25 times 5 and adding another 2/25 yields 11/125. \nD: 3- If the chance of having two heads is 11/25, then it takes 3 times to get 2 heads but the chance is also low since 3/2 is almost equal to 1.5. If 1.5 times 5 and then add 1.5 and you will get 8.5.\nE: 4- This doesn't make much sense because 2/4 is equal to 1 and it is not very likely to get 2 heads in 4 tries. If you multiply 2/4 times 5 and add 2/4, then you will get 32/64.\nAnswer: 5- For each chance of getting two heads, it has a 1/2 chance of being a head. The chance of getting 2 heads in a total sum of 5 rolls is 1/10/25 which is multiplied by 5 to get 1/", "answer": " 10"}

Option A is not correct because Washington was alive during the 1777s. We must consider other options.\n\n2. We can quickly eliminate option B because Washington did not start the Revolutionary war in the 1750s.\n\n3. Similarly, we can eliminate option D because Washington signed the Declaration of Independance more than 100 years later in the 1780s.\n\n4. Option C was the result of another choice, which eliminates this one.\n\nFinally option E is the correct answer.\n\nGeorge Washington was alive in the late 1770's when the American revolutionary war started, and he was one of the men that signed the declaration of independence.\n\nGeorge washington was a politician, a farmer, a leader in the american military, and a president.

{"text": "The answer to the question will be at most 280 pages per day and the total pages is at most 840.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. First we need to find a pattern in the amount of pages John writes a day. We can tell from this that the amount of pages will not exceed 280.\n2. Using this information, we want to solve for the maximum amount of pages John writes in a day. This can be done by simply subtracting the minimum amount of pages John writes with the least number of days. The minimum amount of pages John will write when he writes 20 pages per day for 20 days will be 20 + 20 + 5 + (20/3) + 18 + (20/5) + (20/2) = 268.\n3. Now that we have the minimum amount of pages that John writes, we can subtract this from the maximum amount of pages that John will write, and we get 400 - 268 = 132 pages.\n4. To solve for how long it will take John to write 3 books, we want to solve the amount of days it will take. The amount of page x days, where x is the amount of pages written in a day, can be arranged in the form:\n\n(100 * x) - x / 2 = 3\n\n5. Let's simplify the equation to something we can solve for x.\n\n3(100) - 2 = x\n\n6. Simplifying the equation, we get:\n\n200 - 2 = x \n\n7. Solving for x, we get: x = 200 - 1 -> x is equal to 199.\n\n8. To find the answer to the equation, let's use the value of x.\n\n400 / (200 - 3) = 199 \n\n9. Simplifying the fraction, \n\n400/(296) = 198\n\n10. Adding one to both sides of 198, we get 0 199.

{"text": "### Explanation:\nThe number of movies that were watched would depend on the number of hours watched overall. \nThe solution to this question will come from manipulating the given equations, using basic operations, and using the information given in each step.\nLet's apply the following formula:\n\\\nt = time taken to watch a movie (in minutes)\nc = number of total movies to be watched\nt = 135 / (c * 100)\nNow, t = 135 \nDivide 135 by c*100\nMultiply the resultant answer by 100 \nHence, 75 would be the time taken to watch a single movie.\nSubtract Tuesday time 75 and Wednesday time from the total time of 4:30, and the resultant answer is 50 \nSubtract number of total movies of Tuesday (7x10) : The answer would be 70, subtract from 50\nFinal Answer: 60.\n\n**HINT:** Here we can make use of a basic formula that is used to calculate average time. This formula is given by : \nAverage Time = Number of Movies  * Time to Movie \nSo, for Grandpa's viewing patterns, average time = 135 minutes = 75 minutes. \nUsing this formula, we can find out the time for each movie. \nFor example, if Grandpa watched 60 full-length movies in 4:30 hours, he watched 60/ 75 minutes = 8 movies per hour. \nSo, we need to find out number of hours each day Grandpa watched Hallmark channel.\nNow, we find out number of movies per day Grandpa watched. \n7 Tuesday and 3 more Wednesday, so total 10 movies per day. \nAverage time = time taken to watch the movies. \nMultiply by number of movies per hour to get number of hours the whole day taken up on Hallmark channel. \nSo, in order to get total movies watched, we need 100/8 hours and multiply by 10, the resultant answer is  1250", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Add up the inches of sndake one and snake two. There are 2 feet plus 16 inches, so the answer is 1 feet plus 16, which is 17 inches!\n\n### Analysis:\nThis test task asked us to add up the length of all of the snakes that Christina had and use that answer. To answer this question, you will need to understand the question: \"How many inches are all of Christina's snakes combined?\". This question has two parts, one is the 17-inch answer and the other is what the answer is combined from. First, we need to understand what information has already been given so we know what to answer with. For example, in the last question, we know that the snakes Christina had were \"1 snake which is 2 feet long, another snake which is 16 inches, and the last snake is 2 inches\". These pieces of information tell us that the snakes that Christine has, are combined to 17 inches. \n\nNow, we understand the question and what the answer is, we just need to add the 2 feet and the 16 inches. First, we need more information. In order to complete the first task, we need to know about the number of snakes so we can add them up later. The answer is 3, that is, Christina has 3 snacks. Next up, we need to know the feet number of each of the snakes that we have. We know that one of the snakes is 2-feet long, and then the two snakes we said together make the number of feet to 17 inches long. If we were asked to add the last question, we need to add 1,6 to figure out the answer to the 3rd question. Using the information given, we can see that we need to add to the 17 and 1 to come to the answer. Now that we know the information for the 1st question, we can subtract that number from the question of Christina's combined snakes. For the third question, 17 - 1 = 16. We then need to determine which number is greater than this number. In the last case, the number that exceeds the number is the answer. This means that 17 inches is the answer that we need to get.

{"text": "Total cost of the gifts: $741.\n\n### Detailed response:\nDetailed steps:\nLet's look at the data given, then calculate the costs of all individually.\n1. Mr. Grey received a $12 Rebate, so we have to subtract that from the total.\n2. This step is similar to the step of $12 rebate since we have to subtract $166 from $26 or 6 x $26 to equal $166.\n3. Therefore, so far, the total cost of shirts are $28.\n4. This step is easier since we know how much Mr. Grey has.\n5. In this step, we have to subtract $83 from $166, equal to $63 times $83.\n6.  So Mr. Grey has paid $69 in 2 necklaces.\n7. Now the question is, how much did Mr. spend on Mr's computer game?\n8. This step is harder so we need to think carefully.\n9. This will depend on one major step : $90 - $12 rebate = $78, how many times 78?\n10. The answer is 78 x $12 which equals $936, so Mr. Grey has to pay more $936, with rebate of $166, so Mr. has to pay $770 for a computer game.\nNow we calculate in our total:\n11.

Choices:  Answer A: get a new key so he no longer needs the scissors Answer B: get a new key and a new pair of scissors Answer C: get a new key Answer D: throw away the keys and the scissors\n\n### Rationale: A: The last three verbs are present continuous, meaning they are ongoing processes. A new key can be made in the present so Jeff can use it to make new keys in the process.\nB: Keys are necessary for making new keys so this should not be part of the answer.\nC: A new key should not be the only one to be obtained, rather a solution which has two potential verbs.\nD: The last verb is past tense, meaning the process has ended. It is unlikely that the key making process is still happening. Additionally, old keys should not be discarded as they can be reused, unlike the scissors.\nThe answer should be a solution that has multiple verbs which allows Jeff to access a key using both present and past continuous tenses.\nAnswer C: Get a new key.\n\n### InputA: If a bus has three times the capacity of a car, and the capacity of a car and the capacity of the bus are the same, how many times is the bus\u2019s capacity greater than the car\u2019s capacity?\n\n### Rationales: The key to this question is a simple multiple.

{"text": "The cost of each phone call for her in her job is fifty cents, which is the fifty cents per minute for each call multiplied by the one minute. If they are five minutes each, it would be five cents each instead of fifty cents, but I am assuming it is a full minute per call. I was able to figure this out from her manager telling her that she should call as few people as possible when talking with customers. Since they don't talk with anyone for a long period of time, her manager tells her that customers are unlikely to hang up on her if she stays as short of a time as possible with a caller.\n\n### Rationales: 1 The manager is giving this advice to try to reduce how much she talks with customers during the phone calls.\n2. Since they are supposed to be limiting their time on the phone with customers, the manager tells her to call as few people as she can to save on time spent with customers per phone call.\n3. This is why the manager tells Ayla to stay on the phone with customers for a short amount of time. The manager isn't providing this advice if all customers are talked to for one hour per month.\n\n4. Therefore, the phone bill at the conclusion of the month at a fee of fifty cents per call (50 = 0.5 cents per minute) on a phone call that lasts a full minute will be the same as 50 * 0.5 = 25 cents because each call that month was one minute long.\n5. Ayla, however, needs the fee to be fifty cents per call, so the phone bill at the month's end should equal 50.\n\n6. We can then multiply the cost of each call (fifty cents) by the number of calls made in a month so that the phone bill at the ending of the month is the same as the fee for each phone call. The phone bill at the end is the total cost of the calls multiplied by the number of calls, so 25.\n\n7. Since her boss said she should call as few calls as possible per month, I am assuming that the phone calls are fifty cents per phone call, rather than five cents per phone call as that would not be the optimal choice given her boss's advice. Hence, she should be calling 500 calls per month", "answer": " 600"}
{"text": "1. Amanda starts with 24 marbles; Katrina starts with 13 marbles; and Mabel starts with 252 marbles.\n2. A new rule is formed if the two numbers are multiplied.\n3. Mabel has 84 marbles; Amanda has 12 marbles\n4. Amanda has 36 marbles; Mabel has 48 more marbles than Amanda.\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: Understand what each line of the math problem means in English.  \nFirst, we observe Mabel\u2019s starting number. The number given, 252, should be the number that Mabel started with. This is stated and not left up to interpretation/assumption like many other math problems.\nNext, we identify which person got the least number of marbles. This should be Amanda. She starts with 13; a smaller number than Mabel\u2019s 252 (given at the start of this step), and Katrina (not stated), so we know Amanda received the lowest number.\nLastly, we can calculate the final number for Amanda. We know she starts with 13 and ends the problem with 12 more than Katrina. Since Mabel has 1 times more than Amanda, the new number for Amanda should be 25 (1+12).\n\nStep 2: Identify the words \u201cas\u201d and \u201ctimes.\u201d These indicate multiplicands and multipliers.\nThe words \u201cas\u201d and \"times\" are often used to describe times. The math symbol for \u201cas\u201d and \u201ctwice\u201d are usually both written as a multiplication symbol, like these two cases: \u201cas +3 times 3\u201d. Both of these forms mean that the times are just the number of times to do something; not the multiplied numbers themselves. This makes sense, since it would be weird if the multiplied number of times was included in the final result, like 15 times 2 means the number is actually 30. We can assume this is exactly what the instruction is asking.\n\nStep 3: Summarize the rule.\nIt\u2019s stated within the instruction that Mabel has 5 more times as many marbles than Katrina. What this means is Mabel has 5 marbles more than Katrina", "answer": " 63"}

Rebecca gives one-third of her books to Mara, leaving her share at 60, and Roselyn has 60 books left. Therefore, 60 + 40 + 80 = 120, or Roselyn has 120 books left. Hence, the only choice that aligns with these statements is that Roselyn had 120 books before she distributed.\n\n### Input -\nThis is the last exercise of the section.\n\n### Response -\n\n\n\n### Rationales -\n\n### Response to task:\n### Instruction to Response:\nWhich of the following is the largest of the following numbers?

{"text": "They charged you a gratuity of $24.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn order to find the answer, we need to first write out each portion of the original bill. Then, we need to know how much of an individual item the sales tax is, so we have to look up the appropriate rates. We then multiply each individual part of the bill by the appropriate percent.\n\nOriginal Bill:\n$140 Sales Tax: 10% = 0.10 $80 Total Item Cost(TIC): 80% x 0.10 = 0.08 $10 Total Wine Cost: 10% x 10 = 1.00\n\nFirst, we need to find the TIC, since that's the piece of the bill that's directly charged taxes. This can be reached by dividing the total bill of $140 by 0.80 (80%), which gives the price of the NY Striploin, which was $80. \n\nNow, we need to find how much the wine costs, this can be reached by diving the total cost of the bill by 1.0 (100%). Therefore, the wine cost us $10.\n\nNow, we multiply each item by their respective percentages in the sales tax. The sales tax on the NY Striploing is 0.80 x 0.1 =.08, because we divided the total price of the strip by the amount of the tax. The second percent,.10, is the tax for the whole meal. The total result is.18, or eighteen cents.\n\n### Last step, multiply the sales tax of the strip by the sales tax of the whole meal by.18, giving us total gratuity of 0.18 x 0.80 and.10, which sums up into $0.24.\n\nAnswer:", "answer": " 41"}

{"text": "For a total of 45 minutes.

He was therefore off the field for that amount of time, which was 35 minutes. In total he played 55 minutes, so 20 + 35 = 55. If 55 minutes rounded down was 45, that tells us 20 + 45 = 65. 35 is a factor of 45 + 45. 35 \u00f7 45 =.7895, which you can round to 80%. Therefore,.7895 * 20 =.12979. Multiplying by 20, which gives us 2.59, which can be rounded to 3, and adding this to the original 20, we find that 3 + 20 =.25. Multiplying by.25 gives us.05, which we can round to.1. Adding.1 to 20 gives us 21. The question specifies that the total time includes the minutes spent resting.

Let's begin by simplifying this problem by setting up some relationships among quantities with the same units.\n2. Here, we only need to know the width and height of each wall, which means we can ignore the 'and' operator in the final sentence.\n3. From the first sentence, we know the width of each wall, which together with the second and third sentences, provides enough information to express their heights.\n4. Also, the given values of each wall's area indicate that each can covers a square-meter and not a sq m.\n5. The final sentence refers to the third wall, which may lead to confusion.\n6.

To figure this, you divide the income (30,015) by the amount the girl earned (1).\n3. So, each girl earned 1.15.

However, it's not a widely used material, and it doesn't have an official name or term. Additionally, leather isn't typically made from pumpkins due to its texture and appearance. Hence, it's not better than plums.\n3. Option III: strawberry. Strawberries can be made into a soft, chewy leather-like substances but not a common form of material used for craft or fashion.

{"text": "The stuffed animals cost $7 each\n\n### Rationales: \nLet's evaluate each statement from the question carefully to determine the answer.  \n\n1. _\"At a garage sale...\"_ - This implies that Tish bought multiple items at the sale.\n2. _\"Tish bought 4 items...\"_ - We know it wasn't just the sticker, because it cost more than that. The horseshoe magnet isn't a toy, so it's not likely to be from the garage sale. It must have been one of the two stuffed items or the sticker, which would be the most likely options.\n3. _\"One quarter...\"_ - The stuffed animals are sold together, which means they cost double the sticker and 4x more than the magnet because the magnet only costs one quarter price of the stuffed animals combined. The only other reasonable solution is the other stuffed animal is free or cost $1 each.\n4. _\"The magnet cost...\"_ - The magnet cost $3. Using the information above, the stuffed animals combined are $7 and the cost of one stuffed animal is $7 / 2. So the horseshoe magnet cost one fourth, or $7. We know that the sticker cost only one quarter of the total price paid for the stuffed animals, so it must have been $1.50.\n5. _\"If...\"_ - The if statment is only accurate if the horseshoe magnet costs $3, which we have already established.\n6. _\"The magnet...\"_ - The horseshoe magnet must have cost $3 because that is how much the total price of the stuffed items bought.\n_If the horseshoe magnet was $6, then the total would have only been $16.50 ($6 * 2 + $1.50 = $16.5) and if the horseshoe was $2, then the total would be $10.5 ($2 * 2 + $3 = $10.5), which we know can't have bought the stuffed animals.

The first thing to do is identify the information given in the statements and the mathematical formula or concept that is being used to convert the information to something the computer can work with.  In this case, there are three given statements and a mathematical formula.  First, the statements are that one barnyard owl can hoot five times per minute; that, five times less than twenty per minute can be heard emanating from the barn; and, the answer is how many barnyard Owls are emanating from the Barn.<br>\n2. The mathematical formula in the last sentence is that there is a ratio in effect.  For each time interval (one sound), there is one barnyard owls.  Therefore, the formula can be stated as 1/50 that 1 barnyard owls per sound is made.  In this formula, 1 = one barnyard owlish, 50 = 50 times per minute, 1/50  = times that less than 20.

From Monday to Wednesday, Mack wrote a total of 45 minutes on Tuesday, a total of 30 minutes on Monday and a total of 5 pages on Wednesday.\n3. 45 minutes + 30 minutes + 5 pages = 88 minutes.\n4. Therefore, 88 minutes = 88 / 60 = 1.47 (rounded up to 1.5) pages.\n5. The total number of pages Mack wrote from Monday to Wednesdays is 1.5 * 3 = 4.5 pages.\n6. Hence, Mack wrote 4.5 + 1.5 + 5 = 11 pages from Monday to Wednesdy on his journal.\n7. The question asks how many pages Mack wrote from Monday through Wednesday. \n8. 11 is a number that is only contained in Monday through Wednesday, given that it is a total of 8 pages between the periods and 1 more on top of that.\n9.

Therefore, we'll start by evaluating each of the choices.\n3. Answer C: If each person had 15 more cookies than they did, each person would get 222.5 candy and brownies. The number of desserts each person should get is 186.7, which is not the same as 104.7.\n4.

Answer B: If she had the same number of cookies but fewer brownies, each person will get 3/5 of what they get when her dessert counts are identical.

Though 'intricate' and 'delicate' both mean 'detailed', they mean a different thing in this sentence. They both refer to things that are extremely detailed but while intricate is defined as interconnected and complex, delicate, in this context, refers to details that are extremely slight.\n\n### Line5\n\n'Intricate' refers to something that is very small yet very complex, it does not necessarily have to be a detailed arrangement.\n\n## Line 7 (the final conclusion)\n\n'intricate' means something that is very small but very detailed and complex. Here, we don't know whether 'intricate' is used to define machines or buildings. We know that a building isn't necessarily complex and detailed but machines are. Machines are complex, interconnected systems as well. Therefore, the answer can be 'apparatus', since the option describes a complex system.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIf we are asked what machines are interconnected, we probably wouldn't think about an apparatus, though we can technically", "answer": " 32"}

{"text": "Jackson has 100$\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe first step is to understand the question. After reading it, you should have enough information to break it down into manageable parts. You will quickly understand that you need to know 3 things:\n\n1. How many times more money does Jackson have than Williams\n2. Together, how much money does they have - 150\n3. How much money does Jackson have, given the third clue, 150\n\nNow that you know what you need to find, you have to find the relationship between the elements. In this case, Jackson has 5 times more than Williams, then their combined money adds up to 150, so Jackson's portion can be found using this formula $X * 5 = 150 - $X = $200. Solving for X will give us $200 / 5 = 40 and $40 is added to $150 to get $190. Since $190 < $200, we get $200.", "answer": " 125"}
{"text": "Sheila measured the same exact height as Griffin. \n\n### Response Rationale:\nWe have three groups of people, each with a height. We know that Gracie is 7 inches shorter than the original group of people. This implies that her height is somewhere between theirs and 7 inches shorter. We know that they are 61 together and one's added to the other, the end result is that they are not exactly 62. This implies that 7 of their 61 is either subtracted or added to 62 so instead of 61 and 7, they are now 62 and 5. This therefore equals 11 in order to reach 61 since 5 + 11 equals 16 and she is at 62\n\n### Instructions\nAnswer the questions posed in each step.\n\n### Step 1:\n\n> *What question is this?*\n\n### Step2:\n\n> *Who was first to get out of the hot car?*\n\n## Step 3:\n\n\n> * Who went out to walk their dog before sunset?*\n\n\n## Step 4:\n\n\n>Were you out of the house by 9 pm?*\n\n\n\n## Step5:\n\n\n>Did you stay for 2 more hours?*", "answer": " 56"}

Downtown (option B) might be the best choice as downtown areas typically feature one or more shoe-stores.\n3. Besides downtowns, (option C) shopping malls also often include shoe stores, but they are not likely to be the best choice, since they are more likely to be crowded with other shops than one-stop locations for shoes exclusively.\n4.

It might be difficult to get to the suburban shoe store (option D) and therefore, might not be ideal.\n6.

{"text": "Jean should buy 4 packs of cupcakes to be able to give one cupcake to each of the 100 children.\n\n### Rationales\n\nStep 1:  Understand the question. There are two options of cupcakes given, therefore we need to calculate how many cupcakes will be required per pack. Jean purchased 4 packs of the larger-sized cupcakes, implying that each package will contain 15 cupcaked. This implies that each pack of cupcakes will contain 45. After, Jean purchased these packs from a vendor, who charged her $0.50 for each pack. The seller also mentioned that the cupcakes cost $0.10 each, making the cost of one cupcake $0.60. In the end, Jean purchased 4 pack of the larger version cupcakes, thus amounting to a total cost of $2.40 paid for a total of 45 cupcakes.\nStep 2.  Evaluate the choices, \nA: Packs of 10.\nThis option implies that the packages are numbered from 1-10. As the seller originally provided 45, it implies that there will be a total of 5 packages of 10 each. These packages would need to be purchased at a cost of $0.60 per each cupcake. From this, we can conclude that the total cost of this option will exceed $10, implying that this is not the correct solution, as $10 is our maximum budget.\nB:  Packs of 15.\nThis option implies the packages will feature numbers from 15-25. From the total budget of $10 we can conclude that we can only purchase a total of 15 packages, of which we need 2.\nDifference: We can see in choice \"A\" we have five packages of 10, whereas in choice \"B\" we have 15 packages of 15. As such the number of packages of 15 needs to be multiplied by 3. Therefore,  this option is incorrect to our question.\nChoice A: Nope.\nChoice B: Nope.\nRationales: Both options would exceed our budgeted $10 spend, meaning they're incorrect.\n\n**", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "One option is to count the amount of classes that are physically meeting. Assuming all classes are meeting at the same time, that would leave around 20% of students physically in school.\n\n### Rationale The question asks: \"What percent of students are present...\"\n1. This implies we want a percent, so options must be divided by two because there are two options in total: \"school on any day\" and \"not in school\".\n2. If 100% of the students who are physically in school attend, then they wouldn't be \"not in school\". Thus there is some percentage that is \"not in school\". It's possible that not all 40% of students who learn from home have chosen that.\n3. One way to determine that is to count the classes that are physically present.\n4. If 20% of the classes are physically meeting, then 20% of 40% students are physically in school, implying 8% of students are physically there.\n5.

We need a modifier that describes how annoying and mean someone is.\n3. When searching for an adverb to modify 'jerk', we should look for words and phrases that fit the time and place description in the sentence. For example,'really' in'really a jerk' is too short to fit the sentence time/place description.\n4. 'With a big sigh' also doesn't fit the sentence since 'with' isn't modifying 'jerk' in the sentence.\n5. Therefore, 'boss' and 'Mr. Jones' are the only two words that modify 'jerk' in this sentence. Since 'boss' does not describe how annoying and'mean' someone is, we know our modifier needs to be 'Mr. Jones'.\n6.

{"text": "The equation that works for this is the following: `4 * Ryan's party = Taylor's birthday` Now, we know that  `4 * Ryan' party = Taylor's party`, but how do we take that information and get the answer for the question? Well, if we subtract from both sides, we have  `Ryan's party - Taylor's party = 0`  We know that `0 - Taylor's party` equals the number of people at Ryan's party. So, we have  `0 - Taylor' party = Ryan's party`. We can simplify this equation using the idea of the zero property to have  `0 - 0 = Ryan's party` and this leads to  `Ryan' party = 0`.\n\nNow, we know that  the number of people at Taylor's party is not equal to 0 (since the party still occurred and had people at it). By the same principle, we know that  a party that occurs 4 times as frequently as another party still has an at least 4 times more number of attendees than a party that happens once as much as another party.  So, `Taylor's party > 0`.\n\nTherefore, `4 * Ryan'party > Taylor's party` and `720 > Taylor's party`.

The column labeled \"Day\" tells us what number day it is.\n3. The column labeled \u201cBaked\u201d tells us the number of cookies baked by Frank.\n4. The column labeled\u201cEaten\u201d tells us the total number of cookies eaten by Frank and Ted combined.\n5. We can fill in the remaining rows of the table by calculating the number of cookies that are baked and consumed for each specific day by Frank and Ted.\n6. For the first day, 2 trays (ie., 12 cookies each) are baked by Frank, and since Ted did not come yet (\u201cTed arrived\u201d is false), only Frank consumes one of the 24 cookies, which leaves 23 cookies untouched.\n7. The next day, Frank would bake 2 trays, and Ted would come and eat 4 of the 12 remaining cookies from the previous day (as indicated in the \u201cEaten\u201d column), which leaves 8 remaining cookies at the end of the day.\n8.

{"text": "28 hours\n\n### Commentary:\nThis question can be broken into two steps. First, find both players' number of games this season.  Since Jerry's two daughters each have 8 games, the sum of this gives us 16 games.\n \nNext, multiply the number of games by each team's practice time (4 hours) to find Jerry's total time spent at the softball field.  The answer is the sum of the time spent attending each of Jerry's daughters' games.  8 games x 2 hours = 16 hours. Add his daughters' individual practice times (8 x 4 = 32 hours). Add both time quantities together to get the total (16 + 32 = 48). Next, divide the total (48 hours) by the number of his daughters' games (16 games) to calculate Jerry spent (48 / 16 = 3 hours attending each game).\n\n### Step 1: Find number of games Jerry's daughters play\n\nFrom the given formula, one can see there are different variables but in this case the most significant ones are: 1. 'girls play x games' where x denotes the total number of games played by the girls. 2. 'practice time' given that the given problem consists of 4 hours for every single game. 3. And finally, 'a' which denotes for the number of girls (in this case two)\n\nUsing the value set for the three variables above:  x=16, a=4, then plugging in the values: 16 games x 4 hours per game for girls A and B = 64 \n\nWe can also get the same answer by considering each of the x games played by girls A and B separately\n \n### Step 2: Total time spent at the field watching the games\n\nThe next step would be to calculate the total time spent at the field to watch both girls play in a game, and practice. We assume that each game is 2 hours in duration. We can multiply the total number of hours that Jerry's daughters will spend at the field by multiplying each game-hour with the number of games played (in this case 8 games for both girls, because in this problem Jerry has two girls whose time he's looking to calculate). 8 games x", "answer": " 96"}

As his second job he works 20 hours per week at an hourly rate of $16.95.  How much does James earn each week?\n\n## Response:\nYou work 20 hours at your secondary job, which pays an hourly wage of $16.85, which you earn as your main salary. Your first job earns you an hour for 30 hours at $24.80.  So, your primary salary is calculated as $408.89.  $0.66 is lost due to your 20 hours working in your secondary job that pays $16.88 for each hour you work. Then your total salary earnings should be calculated as $407.01, including the $0.66 lost in your second job.\n\n### Demo:\nInput:  There were four friends that went camping.

{"text": "Apple's average cost across all products is $544.50.\n### Explanation:\n1. Step 1: Identifying the purpose of the question. In this context, 'What was the average cost across...' is asking us to calculate the average cost. For this step, we note that the average cost itself is not given.\n2. Step 2: Understanding the problem. We note that the question has information in the form of prices of different products. Apple sold 100 for an average cost of 1000 dollars, and 20 for an average cost 900 dollars. Similarly, 80 Apple TV sold for an average cost of$200. As, 100 * 1000 + 20 * 900 + 80 * 200 = 22000, we determine that the average cost among all products is $4400.\n3. Step 3: Evaluating your answer options. Step 3 is to evaluate each answer choices and determine if they meet the requirements for calculating the average cost. Each of the answer choices is in the form of a specific product. We determine therefore that each have specific product costs and cannot be used to calculate the average cost across all product types.\n4. Step 4: Identifying the correct answer choice. Looking again at the given options, we discover the correct answer choice is B. Apple sold a total of 120 iPhones at an average cost of $500. Therefore, the combined average cost is $500 * 120 = $60,0000, which is 60 times the total cost of $10,000.

They have 4 children with a shared birthday. This means they were already 4 when they had the first child.\n2. We know the age of each family member. Each child represents a year (1-4) in the family. To determine how many years it takes for each child to be born, we add 1 year each time they have a new child starting with each child's birthday.\n3. The parent's age is 4. The first is 4+1+1+1.

Therefore, the total cost of the cards sold by the card shop was $1 to the power of 75.\n\n### Rationale:\n#### The rational part: \n1. Firstly, the card shop has two containers, each with a different price list. One box is $1.25 whereas the other contains $1.75 cards. Accordingly, the boy has decided on buying a total of 12 cards, of which 6 belong from each box.\n2. Secondly, the card shop charges additional 83 cents for the 6 cards bought from the first box and 91 cents for the same 6 cards from the second box. Therefore, he needs to pay 91 cents in total.\n3. Lastly, the total amount paid by the boy is 366.79 cents.\n\n#### The complete solution: \n\n1. Firstly and secondly, the total cost of buying 6 cards belonging from each box is $10, which is the cost of 6 multiplied by 6.\n2. Thirdly, it is 1.75 and not 1.74.\n3. Fourthly and fifthly, it is not $1.75 as initially mentioned. However, it is $1.74 as stated in the subsequent line.\n\n4.

Madam Adams, she is not a \"she\", \"she\" is a pronoun referring to women. So Madam Adams must indicate a man and it does. He is not the first nor a U.S. citizen either.\nIII Madam Curley is a name for women, so it also doesn't align with the question.\nIV. Janet Yellen is just the name of a woman who may or may not be a citizen of the United States, we can exclude her from our evaluation since her name doesn't indicate whether she's the first or a citizen of the US.\nNow that choices I, II and IV are out of the way, it's clear that only option III: Madam Curley matches our criteria.

However, Dorothy will pay a certain percentage of the yearly income. What's that percentage? It is 18% which is equal to the given 10, 900. So the remaining 1, 090 will be paid via tax. In this sense, $1, 09 will be paid as tax for Dorothy's income. Let's calculate the income after dividing into 10, 339 which is $6000. Then, for 6000$ we have to apply tax again so let's take 18% of 6000 $ which is 10, 740$. Then, for 10740, we have to apply tax for one last time so we take 18% which ends up with 1759. We add all these numbers together and take the difference. $$\\begin{aligned} 6000*10339 = 10,339,000\\\\ \\therefore 10,900 = 18%*10,009\\\\ \\therefore 6000(10,909-10,90) = 10,599,000,000 6000\\end{aligned}$$. At the end, we have 6000 (10,590) as income after paying tax for Dorothy.\\$$\\$\nThus, we have to add the last part of the given question. We multiply 600 by 10 which gives a value of $6008500$.

{"text": "The answer would be 10 dollars because two dollars is equal to $25-$2=23 which if divided by four comes to five so 23 divided by 5 equals 4.5 so you take 4 as it is close to 5 and the animal must be over 2 dollars so take 10 which is twice 4.5 so the stuffed animal costs 10 dollars.\n\n### Relevant information:\nThe question is asking us to determine how much a stuffed animal costs.\n\n### Step 1: Eliminate:\nA stuffed animal doesn't just come in one price only, so the choice is between four or more options. Hence we can remove options A- B - C\n\n### Step1: Interpret:\nThe question contains a dollar sign \"$\" which indicates use of currency of dollars, and the statement says a \"stuffed animal\". It is common knowledge that the price of a stuffed animal is never less than one dollar (a dollar equals a hundred cents). So there are no other options in the question, and the answer must be 10 dollars. \n\nDollars are often printed with the $0.50, $1.00, $2.00, $5.00, $10.00, $ and $100.00. Any money that can be divided into a 100 can be referred to as a dollar. In general, one dollar is made up of a 100 cent. A cent is a unit of a coin used as a general or symbolic measurement of value, weight, or quantity. So if a stuffed animal price is $1.20 then that means it's only 10 cents short of $1.00. Therefore, $1.0 is the maximum price of a stuffed Animal can ever be. If you take 10 x 10, you get a 100, and if you multiply 100 by.50 you get 50, then if you reduce a 50 to 0 it is 50.00 and not a 2.25 or 7.50 or a 9 or even 10, because a one hundred can't be less than a 100.

{"text": "1. 2338 bales\n\n### Rationale\nFirst, let's review the givens.\nGiven: The farmer grew 5 acres of grass and had 560 hay bales.\nGiven: Last year, each horse ate 3 bales a day.\nGiven: This year, the farmer owns 9 horses, therefore each horse will eat 3 bales of grass a day.\nGive: There were 31 days in each month.\nGiven: Each hay bale weighs 165 pounds.\nGiven: Start date is September 1.\n\nOur goal: How many bales would the farmer have by the end of December?\n\nSo, the total amount of hay bales per year.\n\n5 acres of grass yield 560 bale or total bales of hay per year. This year, the farmers planted another 7 acres of grass, therefore the total amount of hay would be 630 bales per year. Last year, there were 31 days, thus, we multiply the total number of hay bales 31, and we have total hay bales last year.\n\n165 pounds per bale yields a total of 165 165(165 pounds).\n31 days per each month yields 31(31 days).\n\nOur question is if the farmer will have left by the end December.\nThe months in fall are August, September, October, November, and December. Therefore, if the farmer plants grass in August (which is not given), there would be a total of 4 more months. Therefore, there are 4 months of hay bales. In those 4 months, there are 43 days which is about 28% of days in those 4 months.\nTherefore, the end of December would not be left with any bales of hay if he started feeding horses this year's hay for that time.\n\nThe total number of hay bags per year would be\n165 10(630)(4)(28%) (2338)\n\n165(31)(31)(28%)(10)(630)(4)\n\n(87.7)(10", "answer": " 12834"}

We have to create formulas and calculations based on the two steps of cooking-morning and evening.\n\nStep 1: Evaluate.\n0.5 is 1/2 (in the fraction format used in the question). The reader has to determine the total number of kilograms of rice that was cooked, as a whole, in the mornings and evenings based on the two ratios mentioned in the question.\n\nStep 2: Choose.\nUsing the formula from step 1, we multiply it by 4/10, which is Rose's rice left. For example, based on the given information, the total amount cooked from morning and the evening is equal to 90. Then, Rose cooked 4/10 of that amount. To figure out how many grams of rice she had left, we multiply 0.5 by 4/1, which yields 480 gr.\n\nAfter figuring out the number of grams of rice left (0.5*4 = 2), the reader has to determine how many grams of rose had left after cooking 1/4 of it. In this example, the answer is 480 gr, but if the answer were 481 gr or 0, you would use a similar formula to figure out how many gr.

Choices: A: often B: often C: always D: frequently E: on occasion \n\n### Solution: \n\n### Demostration 1: \n\n**Input:** Question \"Do people often buy food at 'the store'?\" 1. \"Sells only food\" in the sign does not suggest that food is usually bought at the store, and it is irrelevant to the question. 2. The term 'the store' may refer to multiple stores, hence it cannot be identified as 'the store' in the context of the question 3. The question refers to people buying food at 'the store', and 'Do people often buy food..?' means the question pertains to how often people buy food at 'the' store, hence 3. The options A - D do not specify whether the store specified is 'the store'. If the store referred in the question is 'the store', this may be interpreted as 'Do people often buy..?'. Hence, the options are too general and are not suited for the given situation 4. Option \"On occasion' would mean people buy food on occasions at the store, which again will be too general and will not satisfy the given situation 5.

This is because Steve picked 5 pounds on Monday for an extra two dollars, 15 pounds on Tuesday for an extra 10 dollars, and 24 pounds on Wednesday for an extra 20 dollars, leaving over an already 22 pound berry bag. To get to 4 pounds, one pick of lingonberries would be the equivalent of $22. Steve was going to have to pick 2 pounds plus the bonus one pick he decided to take on Wednesday.

{"text": "10 liters.\n### Rationale: Since 5 liters of gas is used per each 1 km, and both trips are round trips, John will need to use 16 km total (30+30).\n### This means that John will need 5 Liters of gas for 16 kilometres and therefore, 8 Liters to travel the 30 km trip plus the same 8 Liters to return for a total of 16 Liters.\n### If John were to travel 30 km and only 20 km, he would need 8 Liters to cover the trip distance and then 5 Liters to return to the starting point. This means he'd then need a grand total of 13 Liters of gas.\n### Another way of solving this question is by using division and by multiplying 1 by the denominator for each trip. This will make 16 km the dividend in the first instance and will make 8 km the dividend in second instance respectively.\n### After dividing, one needs to divide the dividend by the divisor, in the first case, the denominator was 5 and in the second, the denominator was the same, so one gets 16 divided by 5 to arrive at 3 and then 8 divided by 5 to give you two:\n### The final step is to multiply those two answers by 20 and 30. For 30, one gets 60, and for the 20, one gets 40, and therefore, the total gas usage will be 60 litres.\n### The same process can be used to find any answer.", "answer": " 250"}

C: Everyone here is either Alex or Caroline. D: Every Brian in here is named Alex, Andrew or Caroline. E: Not every Alex and not every Brian are Alex or Caroline.\nRationales: This riddle is a common variation of the Elevator Puzzle.\n1. Let's think of each choice individually and determine which names cannot be replaced with other names.\n2. Choice A: 'Every Alex in here is named Andew' - This cannot be replaced with another name because no one in the group has the first name 'Andrew' so they can't all be named 'Andrew'.\n3. Choice B: 'Every Brian is either an Alex or Caroline' - This cannot be solved the same as A because it can be solved but it implies that Brian is necessarily an Alex or Caroline, which is not true for any group.\n4. Choice C: 'Every person in here is either Alex or Brian' - This cannot be properly replaced with another name because 'every person in here is either...' indicates there is only one person per group, and there are multiple people called Brian and Alex.\n5.

We also know Ali has 50 red and 50 green caps.\n7. This is expressed using two values for each quantity, k and x, to denote the quantities in PIE. \n8. Since we need an equation that yields the value of P in this example, we substitute the data for x in the equation and add it to obtain the equation.\n9.

A: her garden is the most beautiful garden in all of her city.\n4.

{"text": "### Explanation:\nThe question indicates that we need to find the number of hours required for Alani to earn $77. Here is what the question does not ask:  \n* Alani wants $5 more than the previous amount paid.  \n* What is Alani's hourly rate?  \n* At what rate Alani earned the $45?   \n \nThis is the sequence of steps to solve this question:\n- Eliminate all the options that have a rate of $10.   \n  Since this question is asking you about the rate required to earn $7, eliminating all the options that have rate of $10 is the first option to consider.  \n- Eliminate $0. \nBecause Alani has already earned some money, $0 will not be a rate at which she will earn $7.   \n- Divide the amount earned and the amount required to determine the rate.\nSince Alani has already earned $45 for baby-sitting for 3 hours, her rate is divided by 3. At this rate, Alani must continue baby-sitting for ( 45 / 3 =) 15 more hours to earn $7.\nTherefore, Alani's earning rate is $7 for every 45 minutes of baby-sitting or $45/3 = $15 per hour.

To calculate the number of people on the bus per day, we multiply 1,201,000 by the number of days.\n3. 1,203,200 is carried by the bus for 13 weeks which corresponds to 3,195,600. As 3,196,000 divided by 13 gives 253,465 we know 1,204,230 is carried by the service per day.", "answer": " 109,200,000"}
{"text": "They will play 4 songs in each set.\n\n### Rationale:The band will play 2 different sets of songs based on their repertoire. We can use the formula A+B=C to simplify things.\n\nA+B=C since we have 30 songs in the repertoire and there are 4 songs in each playing session.  \nA= 5+7= 12 since 12 songs were played in the first two sets of songs.  \nB= 30-12=18 since there are 12 songs played in the first set of songs but there are 30 songs in a band repertoire.  \nA+B=18+12=C (the third and fourth sets in our case).  \nTherefore, the band would play 18+12 songs in the third and fourth set.  \nIn total, they will play 4 songs per play session which can also be expressed as 12 + 12 = 24 + 24=48 songs.  \nThat's how we got 48 songs on average in the third set and fourth sets.\n\n### \n### Input:You could use your phone to open the app if you chose to.

Choices:  D: 32 Choices:  B: 7 Choices:  A 12 Choices:  C: 24\nRationales: Steps 1-3. The first thing we need to do is identify the units of both choices. We can see that 8 is the unit for B, C and D, and 4' is the unit for A. 4' is equivalent to 0.4, so we can say that 8 = 0.4 \u00d7 20. As a reminder, ounces are units of measurement. This means that we can express 8 ounces in terms of 20 ounces. 20 is a constant and we can leave it as is. From there we can see that if the unit of 8 is expressed in terms of 2, that 2 \u00d7 8 ounce = 6 ounces. A similar rule applies, where if it equals as 1 ounce.\n\nStep 4: Find the correct choice using the relationship between units of measurement.\nWe can see that 7 ounces is equivalent to 0 ounces and 8 = 6. We can then plug in the values of 6 ounces in terms 20 ouneses to get: 6 ounces = 20 = 20 \u00d7 6 ounces\nTherefore 6 ounces should be our answer.\n\nStep 5: Check the answer. We can do this by plugging in the values in the inverse relationship shown above. Since we are comparing in terms of 2 ounces, we have: 7 ounces = 5 ounces and 5 ounces = 4 ounces. Therefore we can say that 32 ounces = 7 ounces. Thus 32 ounes should be our answer. We can confirm this by comparing", "answer": " 20"}

If its area is 10 m2 what is the length of\nthe rectangle?\n- To calculate the length of rectangle we first need to identify the perimeter of the rectangle with the\nhelp of its width and length. Let rectangular is ABCD with length 8 meter and width 4 meter.\n| Length (l)| Width (w)|\n| --------|-------|--- |\n|  8     |  4    |--- |\n- We can find perimeter of rectangle by multiplying the length of rectangle by two(4 x 2=8).\nPerimeter of rectangle is 8 meter. Now we have to find the area of rectangle. The area of rectangle\nis 100 m^2. So, we know the area of rectangle is 10 times its length(l). Area of rectangle is 1,000\nsquare meter. From the question rectangle is 4 times the width. We just got area of rectangle from question\nand we already have the perimeter of rectangle. We can find the length of rectangle by dividing \n(perimeter) by (width).\n- So, according to the question area of rectangle is 200 square meter, which is 16 times perimeter of\nrectangle. We just have to multiply the perimeter by 16.  Perimeter of rectangle = 8 m.

Choices:  A. 12 B. 120 C. 1200 D. 120+ E. 144\nRationales:1. We first understand what answer A is. Answer A, the answer is correct. The toaster uses 10 times the amount of power 12 and this can be represented mathematically by 0.12.\n2. Choice B, The answer is correct. The 12 in B represents the amount of power it takes to toast a slice of bread. Which is just an approximation of how much power it uses.\n3. Choice C is correct as well. This represents how many watts they sell for what ever it is. So, the actual answer is 10 times the 144 (watts).\n4. Finally, we have choice D which is incorrect. It represents how much an appliance requires to be used for 10 minutes. Since it takes 10 minutes to toast a slice, this is not the same as using 10 times the power. In this case we would be using 120 power for 10 minutes and using.120 power.\n5. And lastly, choice E is wrong. The amount of wattage does not matter while trying to toast the slice. It takes the same amount of power whether you have 10 watts or 10 billion watts of power being toast the slice. All this says is that a toaster, uses 120 of its power.\n6.

Choices; 1: A 2: D 3: C 4: H 5: G 6: F 7: I 8: E 9: B\nRationales: Here, the question asks about the 4th letter and its corresponding sequence. Therefore, our goal is to solve for the sequence while also finding the 4th place in the sequence.\nFirstly, let\u2019s determine where \u201cA\u201d is in the sequence. By starting at the third letter of the sequence and going backwards, we see that the 3rd letter is \u201cC\u201d. So \u201cA\u201d is the fourth letter.\nAdding letters in this sequence will not change their order so next, we can just look ahead at the sequence of letters \u201cA\u201d through \u201cC\u201d. We can easily see that the 5th letter in the sequence will be \u201cD\u201d.\nThe 6th letter is unknown so we do the same sequence and calculate that our letter is \u201cG\u201d.\nThe 7th and 8th letters are \u201cH\u201d and \u201cI\u201d, respectively; this is the part we do by addition.

The distance from the base at that point is: [(11 - length of flagpole before it breaks) x 2]/2 = 12 - 2/2 = 4 inches.\nThis leaves us with a final answer of 4 in, which is 51 cm.\n\n### Explain your response\n\nFor each choice, note where an answer is correct, and where it is incorrect.\n\nOption #A is incorrect. When the flagpole is broken, the distance from the base where the tip was is now two feet above the ground, making it 1 foot less than two feet above the ground at 1 foot high.\n\nOption #B is incorrect, because the flagpole is 11 feet long and breaks. So, it's not 1 inches from where it broke before, but is actually 12 feet long, so the answer is false.\n\nOption #C is incorrect, because the question doesn't ask to find the distance between the broken end and the base after it breaks. Instead, the question asks to find how far it was from base before it broke. This means that we should use the distance from the point where the flagpole was, instead of the distance from the base of the flagpole before it broke.\n\nOption #D is incorrect, because the broken flagpole is actually one inch shorter from where it was broken from the base. This is one inch less than two feet above than the ground.\n\nOption #E is incorrect. The question specifies the flagpole breaks such that the original point in the tip of the flag broke is dangling 2 feet from the ground.

Assuming this half is referring to the \"half\" in the following phrase \"half the total number\", it is referring to the total number of pincils they share between them.\n\nStep 1: Since the question provides that the \"half the total number\" is equal to 150, this means that the total number is equal to 165.\nStep 2.

You can't eat breakfast in 4 hours. So how much can you eat (B) in one hour?\nRationales:\nA: \nIt took 4 hours to prepare breakfast. This could mean either the food was made from scratch and required a lot of time from cooking to assembling, or perhaps took a long time because it is a complicated recipe involving many intricate ingredients. In either case, this means that the amount of food you can eat in one hour is limited. This could relate to B: the total amount of food you can consume from a meal or from a restaurant.\nB:\nIt is reasonable to say that you can eat a portion of food that is equal to either the area of one slice of bread or the area of one slice from a platter. Both these options are acceptable and can be used to answer this question. A portion of bread typically weighs around 40 grams, so you can eat enough bread to fill up a tray that is of size 0.4 mX0.4 m.

{"text": "Tina makes $18 an hour at work.  She is allowed to work 8 hours, and if she does work over 8 hours she is paid 1/2 her hourly wage for every extra hour, meaning she is paid $9 for every extra hour worked.  You can also figure out her hourly rate for overtime.  You know her hourly rate is $18, but to figure out how much overtime she gets paid, divide $18 by 2.  If you subtract the $9 (the additional $9 you get paid per hour if you work too much), you'll notice you get $-8, which means if Tina work 7 hours for any day of the week, she won't be getting paid.  Therefore, let's say you have $800 total, which means it took her 80.00 x 7 = 10, so Tina worked 10 days (80.00/8.00 =10.00)\n### Answer: Tina should have 80 hours a week if she works 8 hours a day. Therefore, she makes $640 per week.\n\n### Input :Jamie wants to make sure he gets paid $45 every day at his job.  He will work as many hours per day as the store is open, up to 8 hours.

Since there are 12 months in a year, 3 months is 1/4 of the age of a person. Hence, Jolin must be 4 months older than Therese. Therefore, Jolin is 4 months younger than Aivo, and 6months younger than Therse. Then, 5 months must be subtracted from 8 months, 11 months will be 5 and 2 months will be 3.\n\nTherefore, Jolin is 3 months younger therese. 3+5=8 months.

{"text": "According to the question, \"top\" means the highest section of the cart and \"bottom\" is the lowest section of the cart. We can eliminate 5 western novels that Nancy shelved after she finished work on the bottom section since it is mentioned that she quickly put back the remaining half of the books on the bottom.\n\nAccording to the statement \"Half the books on the bottom were mystery books\", it appears that Nancy shelved all of the mystery books, leaving 4 other books on the bottom unassigned.\n\nIt's not clear from reading the question if Nancy also shelved 6 biographies from the bottom with the other set of unassigned books. Since the wording \"after finishing the bottom section\" is ambiguous, we can reasonably assume that Nancy did not shelve 6 biographies after finishing the bottom. Therefore, there were 4 other books left unassigned on the bottom cart. \n\nIn total, Nancy finished shelving 12 history books; 8 romance books; 4 poetry books; 4 other mystery books (which were not already in place on the bottom section); and 4 other books on bottom (which were also not already in place on bottom before she shelved them).\n\nIn summary, Nancy finished 12 history books and 8 romance books from the top section and 4 mystery books, 4 other books and 8 poetry books from the bottom shelf; 12+8+4+4=32.\n\n### Input : 36 days are left in January, when is Valentine\u2019s Day?\n\n### Demostration:\nLooking at the question and the fact that it states 36 days are remaining, we can eliminate Saturday (0), Sunday (1), and Monday (2).

{"text": "There are initially 100 fish in the aquarium, 19 of which are clownfish, while the rest are blowfish.\n\n### Supporting Material:\nTo begin, you can note that since there are 100 fish initially, this means that there must be 50 fish in each tank. A third of the initial number is thus 50 divided by 2 (since there are two tanks, one with clownfish and another with blowfish). So, if initial condition remains the same (50 in each tank initially), then there will be exactly same amount in each tank, which is 25.\n\nThen, since 29 clownfish and 9 blowfish had initially joined together in the display tank, they amounted 38 fish in the display tank initially. However, since 7 clownfish and a third of the remaining clownfish that initially stayed in the display tank had swam back into their own tanks, the number of fish in the display tank amounted to 31.\n\nNow, there were 10 fish in the display tank before, which are 31 fish and 7 clownish that initially stayed in the tank. 7 clown fish swam back into their tanks, leaving 31 fish in the display tank.\n\n### Solution:\nThe solution can be derived by working backwards and assuming conditions hold the same. So for example, you could derive at the initial value by simply adding it all up.\n\nAssumptions: 26 of the 50 blowfish initially stayed in their own tank.  50/2 = 25  There were initially 7 clownshi moved into the display tank initially.  0 + 7 =  7 there were 5 blowfish left and 9 clownfish moved in. 14+9 = 23\n\n### Rationales:\n1. 7 clowns fish initially remained in the display tank and 9 more added. Since 23 left, the initial total has to be 31.\n2. 9 left (7 and 2) and 12 added - Since 29 left, the initial total needs to be 25.\n3. 15/5 = 3 50/2 =25", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "40 h\nR: 40 h\n\n### Explanations:\nStep 1: Understand how many miles to travel and the time it takes. In that case, we can say that it will take 4 hours to travel the distance of 65 miles while traveling the first time. Hence, if we assume the time for the second trip to be the same, then we can calculate the time it takes to complete each travel:\n$$\nT_1: \\frac{65}{1}\nT_2: \\frac{75}{1}\n$$\nWe can also express it as time in minutes instead of traveling distance. Hence, the first travel takes $750$ minutes and the second one takes $650$ minutes. Now, the problem wants us to find the total time, that is simply $T_1+T_2=750,650=1300$\n\nNow, we can calculate the average traveling speed and see the time it takes to travel the 110 miles. Given 2 hours staying at destination, that's $1600$ minutes. Since there's 110 miles, 1600 minutes will take us to the destination and back. So dividing this time with 110 miles results that it will take us about $14.54$ hours to complete the task which is the same as the answer.\nStep 2 : Since the task was on the bus tour, hence we should answer in hours. As the answer is $1300$. hence this is not the final answer.\n\n### Exercises:\nInput: What is the best way to get rich? Choices: 1. A: become a business tycoon 2. B: make a profit 3.

{"text": "The answer is 19.668 meters\n\n### Demostration:\n1. If there will be an increase of10% in height on yearly basis, and the height of the tree was 10 feet in 2017, its height in the following years would be the first height rounded to a one-digit number times the factor 1.1 (10% is equal to 0.10 so it can be rounded to 0.1=1/10 of 10 or divided by 10 and multiplied by 120). In the given case, this implies an increase of 10 feet:\n- In 2018: Increase of 10 feet times 1.1=11 feet\n- In 2119: Increase of11 feet times 1. 1=12.11 feet\n2. The height of the tree on 2018 should be calculated:\n11 feet x 1.1= 12.11\n\nNow we know what height the tree reached in 2018 it can be calculated 19.6 meters (since it reached 11.11 meters in 2019).\n\n3. To calculate an increase of growth on a year basis, you have to multiply amount of growth by the number of years between the years in consideration and sum up those multiplications.\nIn our case we multiply:\n11.11 x 0.99 = 11.088\n12.11x 0.99= 12.081 and\n13.23x0.99 =13.187\nTo sum up the multiplications between growth rate and years between the period of interest:\n11.08 x 2+ 12.09 x 1+13.19 x 0 = 22.278 = the height the tree actually grew during the period 2017 - 2019\n\nThen we can solve for actual height of the tree at the end of 19 and get: 196.78 meters", "answer": " 21"}

This method is called the conversion table. Using this table is fairly simple, but you'll probably find it easiest to just follow along with this example. To use the conversion table, you need to find the row whose column heading is the percent you are looking for. Then, you'll find the number that's 2 spaces to the left on the same row. That's your answer. For example, if you want to find 37.2% using the conversion table, you would find the row that says \"Percent\" in the \"Column Head\" field. Then, you would go down to the field on the left with a number that says 37.2 and that number will be your answer. So, the answer is 7.\n### Input 2:So, how does this method work? Well, the number that 2 spaces to the right of the row that has the percent you want is going to equal the number you would use when dividing the number in the row into the total amount of parts. For every 1% added, you add 0.01. So, to find 13%, you can use the conversion table to figure out that it's 1% less than 14%.

{"text": "Bryan does 90 push-ups\n\n### Demostration: We do this to keep the numbers simpler.\n\n### Rationale: This response is to the first question in which we did 3x15 = 45 push ups, then we did 45-5 = 40 push ups in total.\n\n\n\nInput: How many push ups was Bryan trying to do the first time? Choices:  One: 15 Two: 45 Three: 30 Four: 100 Five: 50\nRationales: Option A: 15 means Bryan started 15 push-up, in the second choice it means that he would do 15 push- ups then rest for next 15, by the end of the last one he did 5 push ups only. \nOption C: 15 is also wrong because after first rest he started 30 so he done 45 plus 15 more equal 60, by resting from it for a second time, which would make the total number of push-ups he done 120.\nOption D: 30 is also wrong, after first rest, he starts doing 10 push- ups, by then he done total 20 push-ups, he continued to do 10 push-ups, which would total to 30, 10 plus 10.\nOption E: 50 also incorrect, because he started rest again at third push-ups only, so he did 45 plus 50.\n\nOption to be chosen: Option B: 45\n\n### Rationales: To keep it simple, let's use the first set in the question. The total done push-ups in the first set is 45, since the initial set of 15 pushups is complete, Bryan gets tired and does 15 fewer pushups, meaning he does 30 instead of 45, bringing the total to 45+5=40, that's 40 push-ups.\n\nAnswer: Bryan does 45 push-ups.", "answer": " 40"}

We see the $4 items are $10.00. Next we see that there is a 10 cent difference between the 1 item and 7 item and the 4 item and the 48 item. We divide our price for the one by the two to get 1 and a half dollars. By multiplying by 1.5 we get 1.5. We take the.5 and multiply that by 10 to get $5.

For instance, Spain has a great tradition of the language and has a very high number of native speaker in the world population. However, this means that a person who learns Spanish in Spain will be exposed to a significantly different type of Spanish as compared to someone who learns the language in Venezuela, which has also adopted the language as its national one.\nA number of countries have also developed their own dialects of the language and have created certain idiosyncrasies which are unique to a particular culture or area. Consequently, a Spanish learner will likely have a much easier time learning in Argentina and Mexico, countries famous for their Spanish speakers, as opposed to Spain.\n\nSpoken Spanish is most commonly understood to be based on the dialect or form of speech in Spain. The country's Castellano is the most widely used form of the language in terms of the number of speakers, and has evolved over time to be a mixture of many different dialects and elements.\n\nAs a result of its vast history, Spain is very diverse in terms of dialect and colloquial speech.

This gives us 1005 + 45 = 1050, so each crossword takes him around 1050 to write down. The question states \"In order to fill out the puzzle using a pencil, he uses up 1050 with each.\" So he actually uses up a pencils worth of words, 1050 in total.\nThus, the crossword takes 1/1050 words or 0.00096 to fill out. \nThe question asks \"on average\" so it gives us some slack because we have only given the words needed to use up a peg in total.

How many toys did each kid receive?\nSolution: We know the boys got 10, because it mentions that Bill and Hash get 10 and Bill has 5, Hash has 5. So in total, they got 20. The girls got 14, because there is three girls and their total was divided by two: 14. We also subtract 11 from 20 because they're not as many for each girl as for each boy. So each boy got 10, and each girl got 14 - 11 =3.\n### 3. How much would Bill be willing to pay for the toy?\nSolution: That is easy to work out, he is willing to pay $40 because he has $50 and he knows that the toy doesn't cost $27 dollars.\n### 4. Is it worth it for Bella to buy the toy?\nTo work this out, we first subtract $12 from $240, to find out how much Bella has left. She has $228 left. The toy does not cost $27, she needs to think about what percentage of $27 she has. So we divide $27 by $228 like this:\n27 \\text\u00f7 228 = 0.1136\nThis equals 11.36%\nIt is now an easy task to work out, the toy costs 11.3% of her money, so she has \u00a320.64 left.

{"text": "Mike's salary is: $3600\n\n#### Rationale:\n1. We know that $3600 is 130% of $2700. $2500 = $3600 => $4000 = $2500 2. Let's convert '5 months ago' to months - $1000 is 10 times 100= $10000 - 10*10 = 90. Mike was making $3600 which is 10 times more than $800 which Fred was making at the time hence Mike's salary = 10 times Fred's.\n\n$800 + 10*(90) = 3600\n3. Fred's salary now is 130 % of $1000 => $1300 = $1000*130% 4. His salary is $800 (5 months ago) and 40% increase =(800*40/100)100$= $100.\n\n3600 = 10*800 => 3600/10 = 360 360=800*4=> 360=2400*4(since 10 is left over) 360=$1000*4 and $800(Fred's salary) 360=10*80\n\n5. Increase % of Fred's salary = $x.\n\n$x*5/10$= $1*5/10 => $5= $x.\n\n6. If his salary increased by 40%, his salary now should be 3600= $4800(3600*1.4) => 360*1.40= $504 => $5040.\n\n7.

One, what is stain on teeth? \nand two, how to remove that stain? As to the first part, is it a stain or black paint? The two are distinctly different, where painting of the teeth is uncommon and thus it makes sense to assume that it is a stain.\nAs to the second part, how to remove a stain, each choice except C and the answer suggests using a brush. This is because stains are frequently removed by using a brush, and brushes are the more common means of removing stains on teeth.\nThus the answer is the only option that is neither related to a brush, C, or is a synonym for brush, D.

Using the above rule of thumb, we plug in zero for the number of dust particles on the porch and we arrive at the answer options of 224 or 330.\n4. Looking again at the options, we can determine that 330 will satisfy the initial data provided at the start of the problem.\n5.

John was part of the pair of friends, so he wouldn't be the one who does math more than George. Also, both John and George split up to continue separately, so it doesn' t make sense that one has to do math more than the other.\nB. George has no reason to work on a math more than John, when he is splitting up from him.\nC. Both men have separated from each other, so if they were going to do any of math more, it would be individually.\nD. One pair of man split up leaving John alone, but George, so John would have to do math more than George.\nStep 2. Choose the response choice that has sound rational.\nA: John and George equally\nAnswer:C: John and George equally.\n\n#### Task:\nWrite a response that appropriatelycompletes the request.\n### Input:Who does math more, John or George?\nResponse:  Choices:  A:(a)  John does more B:(b) John and George equally C:(c) George and John equally D:(d) George does more\nRationales: (a) Math is a single task that is performed or done, which can be described by two terms, such as John and George. Therefore, there is no quantification of math that is done because it's an activity that doesn't have more or less units.\n(b) If John and George were working together on math when split up, then each individual performs the same amount of mathematical tasks, which is an equal amount of math for both John and George. Therefore the answer is (b) John and George.\n(c) The phrase ``math more`` implies that one person is doing more math than another, but not to the extent of there being more math. This indicates that math must be performed, which means that each individual person is performing the same number of math, hence they are equal. Therefore the response answer is (c) Geor", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "Matt worked 600 more minutes on Wednesday than he did on Tuesday. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: On Monday, Matt worked for **450**  minutes in his office. On Tuesday, **he worked half the number of**  **minutes he worked on Monday**. On Wednesday, **he worked for 30**  **0 minutes**. How **can many more minutes**  **did he work on Wednes** **day** **than on Tuesday**? \nRationales: The question asks for the number of minutes he works every day from Monday to Wednesday.\n1. On Monday, he worked for 45 hours, which is 450 minutes. This could potentially be the number of minutes he tends to work on Monday.\n2. On Tuesday: **he worked half the** number of minutes he worked **on Monday.** Given that he only worked for 45 minutes in total, this can't be a number greater than 45 minutes.\nTherefore, 450 - 45 = 405.\n3.

{"text": "1. We first draw a diagram of a single boat's position in relation to a row of boats as the illustration. We have row of 10 boats and each boat has 2 feet between, hence the row is of 20 feet.\n2. So, if we draw the row then the boat fits between the row, but we need a bigger area, not counting the riverbank. We will be using the width of the river to cover the rest. If we subtract that, we get that each boat fits in a rectangle.\n3. This rectangle does not have a width of 8 feet, but we can divide it into 3 parts: [width of the boat] + [distance between boats] + the riverbank, or 3 + 4 + 7 = 14.\n4. So, we get that there can be 14 boats fit in the river if the river is 42 feet wide.\n\n### Rationale: This response is correct because the boat can be rowed in the river, without touching the other boats in the row. But to row, the boat requires extra space, the rest width is used by the row, hence the boat has a width of 11. In conclusion, each boat can be rowed without touching other boats, and there are 14 boats (10 + 1 width) in the river, if the river width is 42 feet. This is consistent with the given answer choice D.\n\nAnswer: D: 14 boats\n\n### Other solutions\n\n#### A: 3,560\n\nRationale:\n\nLet's find the two possibilities A1 and A2, that the boat can fit between the other row or the bank, without touching the riverbank.\n\nIn A1, the maximum width if the river is 11, because the boat is 3 feet wide and the river is 10 + width of the boats, or 10 + 3 = 11. Hence, there would be 10 boats fitting between the two. However, if we add the width of the boat, then the river is 14, where only 9 fits.

{"text": "He will need to have 24 more vehicles. We do two weeks because it\u2019s round up.\n\n### Rationale: First let's look at the options because we need to find a word that tells us how many the cars need to be. We can eliminate all options because you can't round up to 24 and none of them tell us how many vehicles are needed or how many days.\n\nThe sentence says that he needs to sell 50 cars to meet the quota for the entire month, which can be worked out as 1.67 cars per day on average.\n\nThe problem states that he has sold 5 cars in 3 days, which can be worked as 1.6 cars per day in the first three days. The problem then states that he has sold a total of 15 cars in 6 days. This can be worked out as a total average of 2.3 car per day sold in 6 days. \n\nTo meet the quota he needs to have 1.67 + 2.3 = 4 cars a day for the remaining number of days for the month. The question then asks, How many cars does he need for the remainder of the month. We know we need 4 cars to round up to 50. Therefore, Frank needs 4 more cars to meet his quota. Since 30 days is 4 weeks, we now know that he needs 2 more cars to \"round up\" to get the 24 cars.\n\nThe answer is not C: 10 he is way off, or A 4 he is missing one. \n\n### Instructions:A:The 4.6-million-year-old fossil, which belongs to the new species of ape called Pierolapithecus catalaunicus, was recovered from a cave near Figueras in Tarragona, in northeast Catalonia.B:The 4.5-million-year fossil ape, belonging to the new species, was taken from a cave near Figuera in Tarragona, north-east Catalonia.C: The 4.5 million year fossil, belonging to a new ape species called Pierolapitus catalaunicus, originates from Figueras cave in Catalonia.D: The 4.6- million-year a", "answer": " 23"}

The second number we can multiply is our combined hour total by how much each experienced sailor gets paid for that hour. Then, we add up these two things.\n\nFirst, we can multiply the number of experienced sailor members by the hourly earning rate of each crew member. Next, we multiply this number by the total number of hours worked by all experienced crew members, which is 60.

The circumference is c = 2pi r where pi is 3.14\nBoth equations are as follows:\nRectangle: l * w = perimeter of rectangle.\nl = 5m", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "Each of the 3 tea plants has 6 leaves turning yellow (18*1/3)\n\nInput: A farmer had a total of 1200 acres. He sold 1100 acres and kept 100. He sold half of his crops every year. How much land did he have left? Choices: A: 110 acres B: 1099 acres C: 11000 acres D: 1191 acres E: 110\nRationales: We can eliminate option A: 115 acres, and option B: 100 acres because we're working backwards from what we know. 100 acres minus 1099 is 999, so clearly it's not 100 acres.\n\nThen we can eliminate options C: 11,000 acres and D: 11,91 acres because we know \"half\" is an integer, so we can work to that. So half of 1,100 acres is 550 acres, of which only 99 acres remain, which means that the final answer could not possibly be either 11,036 acres (C) or 11,069 acres (D).\n\nWhich leaves the final options as either E: 11 acres (450 acres total - 225 acres + 225 acres = 450 acres) or F: 10 acress. If we compare \"10 acres\" to \"11 acres\", we can see that 11 is a different number. While 10 is the same, only without commas, meaning that the number of acres are equal but simply in a different formatting. We can use the same reasoning to eliminate F: 10 acres because 10 acres is not a number and 11 acres is a number, and because we saw that 11 acers = 450 acres, we know this cannot be 10 acers.\n\nIf we know that 10 acres is one-fifth of the final total, this leaves the final answer as E: 11 acers.\n\nTherefore, the answer is E: 11 Acres\n\n### Input :What is a type of dog that is a", "answer": " 36"}

The problem can be solved by the following steps. Let, A represents number of tomatoes he dried out, B indicates number of remaining tomatoes after drying and so on.\n\nHere we can see that  there are 7 tomatoes in each plant and if we want to find out how many tomatoes from every plant are left then we can say\n\n$\\frac{7}{A+B}$\n\n$\\frac{A+B} {7}$\n\n$\\frac {A+B} {1+1}$\n\nWe multiply and give 7 times 1.\n\nAnd it gives us 7A+7B which we write as (7A1) which can be simplified as (7A).\n\nSimilarly, for b we multiply by 2 and it comes as a fraction 7B/2 which can be simplified as 3.5B(3.5 B)\n\nNow, after the transformation we can put everything together and divide both the terms\n\n$16A+105B$\n\n$16\\times \\frac {A} {7+2\\times \\frac {B} {3.5}} $\n\n$16 \\times \\frac {A}{14}$\n\nNow, the denominator gives us $14$, hence $16A/14$ becomes $\\frac {16A} {14}$ which gives us $ \\frac {A+ B}{1.325}$\n\nFrom here all we have to do is to simplify we can notice here that $ \\frac {2.625A+105.5B}{4.4}$\n\nNow to simplify we need to multiply top by 4.4 and bottom by 2.625 to get $55A+302.5B=$\n$\\frac A {2.0625}$\n$\\frac B {49}$\n\n$\\frac A{20.625}+\\frac B{49}$\n$\\", "answer": " 42"}

I would like to substitute '....complicated.\n\n1. 'Very','very complicated' or'very intricate' is more likely to be said about a machine rather than ordinary things like a car. However, we can't use 'intricate' because it does not belong the list. We need another word to follow this sentence.\n2. 'intriguing', 'intricate': both are about something unusual or interesting (adjective of 'interest').\n3. 'complex', 'complexity': both are about something with various interconnected parts (adjective of 'comprise' ).\n4. 'elaborate', 'elaborateness'.\n\nAfter choosing these words, we can match with the remaining choices: Implement, apparatus, machine, complex, intricate, intriguing, elaborated.\n5. Among all the others, 'complicated', 'elaborate' and 'intricate' have the same meaning of the first sentence( 'elaborated' is not in the choices), so they are only 3 candidates.\n6. 'complicated' has been used at the first sentence, so we don't need to use complicated at the second sentence.\n7. Among the remaining two words, elaborative is not in the choices, while complicated means different degree of difficulty, complexity, convoluted, etc so it is more likely to be used when talking about computer programming.

The total number of seashells collected initially is 59. Henry collected 100% of 11 = 11, making him the first (in the order given in the problem) to collect. Paul collected 24 = 48/59 = 15/18, of the total 59 seashell. Leo was 3/5th of the way through collecting when Paul finished collecting. With 26, Leo has given away 5/26 = 20/59 of what he was collecting and hence lost 5/26, 19/59 of that which he was collecting, equivalent to 19/18 of what he had collected. Thus, he has 26 - 19/16 = 7 remaining. After the shells are distributed, they are re-distributed to take into account this lost collection. Then each individual has: - Henry, 29 / 6 = 46/6 = 8; - John, 19 / (3/8) = 19/8 = 2 (of) 2/3 seashells; - Leo, 5/9 - 3/8 = 43/9 = 9.\n\n### Input:\"Where has my pen gone?\" \"It's just on that table!\" is the reply from your friend.

So Alex ends up with $242 dollars per week.\n\n### Input How far apart are two cities when given the total travel time and the travel distance?\n\n### Demostration\nInput: The travel distance is 100 miles and the total travel time is 10 hours.\nRationales:\n\n**Step 1: First, let's assume that when the total travel time is listed as 10 hours, each hour is equal to the time needed for traveling 1/10 of the travel distance(or 10 miles).** (This can be done by dividing the total travel time by 10 and multiplying it by.1/10).\nThis way, each time the vehicle is on the road, it covers 10 miles.\n\n**Note: This gives the vehicle a speed of 10 miles per hour.**\n\nTherefore, a vehicle can travel 20 miles per 1 hour.\n\n**Step 2: Now, we need to find the total time needed for the total travel distance.**\nWe are given that the total travel distance is 1,000 miles(100 miles x 10).\nDivide 1,00 miles by the miles-per-hour speed of traveling given in Step 1, then multiply by the multiplier 10. \n\n**Step 3: In Step 2, we determined that to travel 1,00 (total) miles will take 200(total travel) hours, but not the whole 200 hours(since the travel time is limited by 10 hours).**\nSo we divide Step 2 by 10 and end up with the answer 20(the total travel) hours.\n\n**Note : We could also solve this by applying the Pythagorean Theorem on a distance formula, giving us a distance of s=(sqrt((10", "answer": " 345"}
{"text": "Let \\(n\\) be the number of movies shown in total throughout the movie theater for 8 hours straight. So the number is 60 by the given information. So \\(n=60\\). By the same principle, we can assume that no movie is played twice. The next two questions will determine the number of movies played each and the number of hours movies were played for. If the theater stayed open for only 4 hours, we would have a total amount of 20 movies played. Given enough information, finding 2 movies that played for exactly 2 hours each should be possible. From there, we can determine how many movies played in total if the theater stayed open only for 2 hours or how many played for 10 minutes.\n\n### Input 2: How many movies were played for 10 mins or less if the theater was only open for 2 hours?\n\n### Demolition: There are 2 options: 5 or 6. To determine which of the 2 options is correct, use the information given from the first part.\n\n### Demo response: Since there are 4 hours total for showing movies, we have to divide 4 by 15 minutes to see how many times each movie was played. The total time is.6 or 1/15 of an hour, so we know that 10 minutes isn't equal to a whole movie, and the 2 answers provided are incorrect. The only possible answer is 6.\n\n### Answer: Out of the 5 or 6 movies shown, 6 of them are less than 10 minutes. In other words, they are not played for full hour. In this case, it's possible to conclude that 4 (0.6) * 6 movies are not played for full (1 or 2 hour). Since there are 26 different movie combinations between movies not played for full hour, we can determine the total combination possible is 336.\n\n## See also\n\n* Ransom Distillation Test\n* Decoding\n* Logic Puzzle", "answer": " 24"}

Choices:  A. flour B. syrup C. cream D. fat E. spice\nRationales: Let us see if the given statements describe a flour, fat, syrup, cream or spice.\n\n1. Flour is an ingredient in cakes. Therefore, that's not it.\n2. Syrup is not an ingredient in any cake. Therefore, that' s not it.\n3. Cream is an ingredient used to make icing or icing for the top of some cakes. Therefore, it's not it. \n4. Fat is an ingredient. It is not possible because the answer should not be the ingredient, just the taste it imparts.\n5. Spice is not an ingredients but is added after the cake is fully baked. Also, spice is not one of the major ingredients, it is not the taste that is being described. There are no spices that determine the taste of the cake. \n\nAnswer:\nThe answer is: E. spice  \n\nWe need to say the spice that is added to the cake to make it taste the way it does. 'She likes the ______ of chocolate cakes better' is not the correct structure as 'like' refers to 'the cake', and not a spice. The structure she likes the spice used in chocolate cake should be used.", "answer": " 48"}

{"text": "There are two basic ways to approach this problem. First, we consider the possibilities where the pages are crumpled and where the pages are not crumpled. Then, we need to subtract the sum of the crumpled pages from the sum of the total number of pages, then divide the difference by the number of non-crumpled pages. In this case, we calculate 42 * 0.3 * 0.05 = 6 pages that are not crumple and 0.7 * 0.33 * 0.66 = 4.96 pages, so the total is 4.96 + 6 = 11 pages.\n\n\nHowever, this process is a bit complex and involves a lot of intermediate calculations. A simpler way is to consider the pages crumpled or not crumpled one at a time and simply subtract the sum of pages crumpled from the number of pages not crumpled to find that there are 11 pages that are not crumbled.", "answer": " 24"}

If Caleb puts out 7 gallons with each trip and Cynthia puts out 8 gallons with each trip, Caleb needs more trips to finish. It will take 7 times the number of trips to use Caleb and Cindy will need 8 times the number of trials used by both to complete the job.\n2. Caleb is working 7 times more than Cindy, so his job will take 7 times as much time as hers.\n3. Each one fills their bucket and takes it with them for the pool.\n4. Cindy can put out more gallons with each trip.

So we can conclude that he still has 52 cards left.\n3. Next we have the options in which Miguel got cards.\n4. A: none of the cards, just 78 he previously gave to friends.\n5. B: 16, since he got half the remaining cards.\n6. C: 32, since he got the remaining cards.\n7. D: 144, since he got all the remaining 52 cards.\n\n### We can see that Miguel got 176 cards, so the only options are B & D. \n\n### Now that we know Miguel got 178 cards, we can add back the 7 cards so give to friends and see that Miguel got 71 cards. \n\nInput: How many remaining cards did Rick have now?\n1. A: He still has 52 + 78 = 130 cards left.\n2. B: He still has 78 + 76 = 154 left.\n3. C & D: He has none, so he could not be giving anything since Miguel got it all.\n\nOutput: Since it asks for how many Rick gave to his sisters and not how many cards Rick has now; let's look at Miguel's remaining cards. \nInput: What did Miguel receive?\nOutput: Miguel received 32 cards (which is 52 - 78).\n\n### Now we have 32.

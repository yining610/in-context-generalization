{"text": "As you can see in the answer, one method to get to the correct solution is to write the subtraction equation that will give you the net cost. For example, Silvia is getting a discount of 10% on everything, so if she orders quiches for $27 and spends $15 on each quiche (10% of $15, $1.5), then her order of quiches is $9+1.5=$10.5 worth of quiches.\nNext, you can write this in an equation that represents the discount, which turns out to be\ncost = subcost + (discount/100) x amount\n\nIn this case, the subcost = price x amount, so we have:\n\ncost = $27 + (0.1 / 100) x (2 quiches)\ncost = $9 + ($2 / 5) = $11.20\n\nSimilarly, for the amount of biscuits we've:\n\ncost = 27 + (0 / 100 x 26) = $5.80\n\nFor the croissants, we have:\n\ndifference = $30 - (0.1 /100) x quantity\n\n= $27 - ($2.7 / 100 )\n\ndifference = 2 $\n\nTherefore, we have the following total cost for all of Silvia's order:\n\n(9.20 + 3 + 5.20 + 12) = $50.\n\nThus we conclude that the answer is B: $50.0\n\nSo the final answer after solving the problem is B: $52.00", "answer": " 54"}

Let's begin by diving into the possibilities of various factors that they could have broken.\n    i) The party was held on the 25th of every month with David breaking 2 glasses each time, which would lead to 2*2 glasses total broken for both him and William for 12 months. This does not make sense, as the parties could have occurred on other days of the month or even could have been missing months of parties.\n    ii) David breaks no glasses on occasions where he does not attend, which is logically false given that he would only be breaking glasses on occasions where they attend the party. \n    iii) William breaks 4 times the number that David breaks, which means that he would also be breaking on occasions where he does attend events and 4 times their number would make sense.\n    iv) Finally, there are 12 months in a year, each on average with 2 parties. There are 250 weeks in a year, meaning that they have 10 occasions to attend parties.

This can be considered a base unit.\n\nIf the building shadow is at length x, then by the definition of unit we can find: x = 60/n.\n\nFor example, at exactly noon (0 hours post noon), the base length would be 0 units, and so: X = 0/60. This means that if the building is a meter tall, then the length of its shadow would be 0.\n\nAs we have previously established, the length of 60th hour shadows is 5 extra inches. Thus, the base length of this shadow must be 10.\n\nAs a result, when X = 10, we can find:\n60/X = 5, and X = 6.\n\nTherefore: After 6 hours past nooning, the length of a building shadow measured in inches is 6 inches.\n\n\nSo the final answer has to be A: 6 inches.", "answer": " 360"}

{"text": "We can determine the total amount of 10 $2 bills that both Oliver and William have. If we consider the $20 bills, Oliver will have $10 more since he has 10 of them instead of just Williams 9. \n\nBut to calculate if this is enough to compensate the total of $45, we need to multiply $10 with $5. This gives 50.\nTo get to the total of the other bills for us to multiply by $15 we should know how many $10 we have for Oliver. So basically, we have to subtract the \nvalue of the bills Oliver doesn't have and then we can multiply the amount with the value of the other bills.\n\nIn our case, the $10 is 50, so we have to get to the $25 by subtracting $5. 50 - $5 = $45 and this means that Oliver does not have any bills of the value of $25, which is 2.5 times more $10 bills than William (3 bills).\nThis means that $20 is 2 times more for Oliver than for William.\nSo the total amount of $20 given by Oliver is $100, while for William is just $85.\n\nTherefore the final decision is that Oliver has $100 in $20 bills while William has $85. \nSo the final answer must be B: William\n\nInput: In addition to tissues, who also uses handkerchiefs?

This is the fastest vibration per second that Matt can achieve with any setting (there being seven in all).\n3) However, he only uses it on the highest setting as it is the fastest setting:\n4) For five minutes, his massager vibrates 2,008,600 times per second (1,400 x 1,400), which constitutes 260 seconds. Thus, every setting can be measured in fractions of one second.\n\n5) At the highest speed, at 60% faster than the lowest setting, each second constitutes one second and fifteen thousand milliseconds, and therefore, 1600 ms is an hour in terms of vibrations per second \n6) Hence, at each setting, one second on Matt's massager constitutes one thousand and twelve hundred vibrations (one million divided by 1250).\n7) Therefore, Matt uses a massager on the highest setting for five minutes which constitutes 761260 (604200 x 754) vibrations, which are all higher than and equal to the lowest setting by 60420 vibrations.\n8) Therefore, the correct answer is: 604220.", "answer": " 768000"}

{"text": "1) The given problem has data from a race that was run by TJ. In this race, the total distance covered was 10k (in km) which means that the total length of the track was equal to 10km. The time taken by TJ to complete a certain distance was calculated to be 20 minutes and 30 minutes. The average time per km can be calculated by dividing the total time taken by TJ in both parts and then subtracting the total number of km completed from the total running time.\n2) The total time taken to complete 20 minutes and an additional 30 minutes is 50 minutes. The average speed is 50 minutes / 10km = 5 minutes per km. There is also a small error margin of 0.1 km with this calculation. Hence, the calculated average speed is 5 kmph.\nSo the final answers are that the ACT Math question is TJ ran a 1,000 km in 2 hours.\nSo the final average time per km is 5 kmph", "answer": " 5"}

While it could refer to just marbles in one jar, it more likely points to the overall total, as the question uses the word \u201coverall\u201d as well.\n\nUsing the information from the question, we can establish that jar B contains more marbles than jar C, and jar C contains twice as many marbles than jar B.\n\nHowever, we still don't know the total number of marbles.\n\nUsing information from the question again, we know that jar B has 12 moren marbles than jar A, and jar C contains 2x as many marbles than A. \n\nUsing the above calculations, we can get a tentative answer that the total number of marbels is 86.\n\nTo ensure that calculation is correct, we need to factor in the amount of marbles in jar A. Using what we learned with the 3 jars, A contains 28 marbles, so adding that to 86, we can see that it is indeed correct.\n\nTherefore we can conclude that the final answer is B: 86.\nSo the final answers is B: 8\n\nInput:Who needs to do maintenance on their golf cart?

{"text": "So, the first clue is that 7 people voted for witch cakes. If there were less voted for the witch, there would have been more people for votes for the unicorn. There would have been an increasing vote total. But because there was a higher number for the unicorn, the vote totals were 3:1. The higher amount of voters would have been to vote for the unicorn and only 1 to the witch. We were told the number of votes for dragon was 25 more and we can assume there were the same amount of people who voted for the unicron and the witch. 15 people voted for the wych and 25 people voted for the dragon. The vote totals were 50 for the unicorn (15+25, 15). That is 35 for the witch. So, there were 7 people who voted for the witch but there were 50 people for the unicorn or 43.

{"text": "1. This question asks about a fish's maximum lifespan. \n2. The father is using a dog's lifespan as a reference point and implying that fish can live two years longer. The father is saying that 6 years is an achievable lifespan for a fish, and they can potentially live 6.5 years. But this is not a question of how long can a fish live.\n3. The fish's lifespan will vary on how it is cared for and maintained, which the question alludes to by mentioning how to keep Ruth's fish alive and healthy. The father implies that the lifespan of a dog is used as the yardstick for how long a fish can live.\n4. We know that fish will live 2 years longer on average, which is 8 years total.\n5. Using the ratio for the average lifespan of a hamster, a dog will then live 4/8 times as long as a hamster, which is 0.5 years, or 15 weeks.\n6. Therefore, a dog lives about 15 weeks for a month of 91 days.\n7. Fish therefore 2 years longer than a dog. 2 years = 8 years. This tells us that a dog's life span is about 91 days. \n8. For this logic we arrive at 91 days,  which is the total number of the time it takes a dog to live the way a fish does in the first two years of its life, which is 8. Therefore, each dog will live for about 8 fish life spans or 6.5 years, which is 91 dog years. \n9. Hence, the total number of years is 300 dog years or 247 fish years.

Because the first number (1) is less than the second number (34) it implies that that coordinate lies \"up.\"\n4.

Granite: Granite is not water-absorbing, so it is not suitable to build dams, tunnels, or other structures that require waterproofness. Granite can crack since it is not dense and therefore weighs less, which means that it can be easily broken by falling.\n\nB. Marble: Marble is water dissolvable since it consists of calcium. Calcium carbonate is soluble in water. Therefore, it can be used to build dams, structures needing waterproofness or in construction if the structure needs to be built waterproof. Marble is dense (13 times as heavy as granite on average), which is why marble is used as part of the foundational material in buildings to withstand the weight of the building. Since marble is a dense material which is harder to crack, it is often used in the construction of buildings where there is high stress and pressure.\n\nC.

If it weighs less than 1000 lbs, it will not hibernate (for instance if it weighs exactly 1000, it would not be able to gain any more weight at this point; it needs to weigh at least 500lbs.)\n\u2022 The bear must get the remaining 50lbs from eating at least 25 small animals. If it gets the rest from eating salmon or berries it cannot hibernate. Also, the bear cannot weigh more than 1001lbs at the point of hibernation or it wouldn't be able to hibernate.\n\nNow let's look at the provided options:\n\n\u2022 A) Salmon \u2013 Salmon can be weighed, so it is a realistic type of food. Therefore, Salmon can be selected as the bear eats salmon for half of its weight gain.\n\n\u2022 B) A mammal other than humans-This would mean the bear is eating some other type of animal and not just small animals. Hence, this cannot be selected as the correct option.\n\n\u2022 C) An ant \u2013 An ant cannot be weighed and is definitely not the type of animal the bear eats. Therefore, this cannot be selected.\n\n\u2022 D) A human \u2013 This would cause an infinite loop. Even if the bear ate all the humans in the world, it wouldn't get the extra weight needed to hibernate for winter. Therefore, this cannot possibly be selected as the correct answer.\n\nThus, the answer is A) Salmon.\n\nSo the final answer for the given question is A) Salmon\n\nOutput: You want", "answer": " 200"}

These ways can be represented using permutations.\n\nSo, the three possible combinations of yellow and orange paint can be represented by: (yellow1,yellow2,yellow3,yellow4,yellow5,yellow6,yellow7,yellow8,yellow9,yellow10,yellow11,yellow12). So now by the combination of yellow paint and orange paint, we can generate all possible colors of yellow. For example ((yellow1, yellow2) = (yellow1,yellow3) = (yellow1,,yellow4) and so on..).

The answer choices are as follows:\nA:4.59 miles\nB:12.55 miles\nC:13.34 miles\nD:22.91 miles\nE:33.75 miles\nOutput:  From Question 17: 1.75 (75% of a mile) = 1.3 (17 miles). Therefore, a bus traveling 75% of the distance will travel 1.3 miles.\n2. The remaining options are distances or ratios, making the answer options B, C, D, and E incorrect.\n3. The 4.59 Miles option indicates a distance of 4.59 miles. It is important to recognize that while the ratio of a 75% trip of 17 miles would be 1.3 miles, the distance of 4.35 miles is incorrect, since it is smaller, and does not represent the actual distance the bus would travel.\n4. The option of 22.91 Miles indicates a distance travel of 22.75716589 Miles, so it cannot be the correct answer either. \n5. Finally, the distance of 33.75 Miles is smaller rather than larger than the given answer of 1.3 (the correct answer based on the correct calculation), making it incorrect once again.\nTherefore, the final answer is A, and must be 4.59 (1.3*3) Miles.   \nSo the final answer 4.59\n\nInput: What is the sum?  a.

{"text": "Step 1: Determine if the question has a consistent pattern of words. Here, in each paragraph, two words that are either repeated (a word that appears twice e.g. clownfish and/or blowfish) or they are exactly the same (e.g. aquarium, clownfish, blowfish). This question follows the pattern of words; thus it is a consistent pattern.\nStep 2: Now we'll ask ourselves this question: Does this question make sense if we ignore the problematic word or phrase? Here, there is no change in the order of the words, e.g. in case of \"clownfish and blow fish\" it remains the same in each paragraph and in case of \"the remaining blowfish swim\" it remains the same. Thus, it doesn't change in any way, thus, it's a consistent pattern. \nStep 3: Now we'll check if a word or phrase is confusing and doesn't make sense. Once the step 2 is answered in the affirmative we'll need to answer this step. Here, if you replace \"the remaining blowfish,\" with a phrase that makes sense, then \"the remaining blowfish\" is the trouble-making word. This is because it is impossible to determine the number of clown fish in the aquarium by simply looking at the blow fish, hence, it doesn't make sense to change the question. For e.g, we can substitute \"the remaining blowfish;\" with \"some blowfish.\" This answer makes sense, and thus a trouble-making word is found.\nStep 4: Replace the trouble-making word with the words that are used in the corresponding portion of the passage. There are two phrases here, \"(a word that appears twice\" and \"(e.g. aquamarine\". Here, we'll first replace \"aquamarine;\" with \"aquarium;\", since aquamarine is not specifically used in the problematic paragraph e.g. \"An equal number of a blow fish and clownfish is in the aquarium.\" After replacing aquamarine, the question is grammatically correct and makes sense.  Therefore, we'll now, replace \"appears twice\" with \"repeated.\" This is because, a clownfish and a blowfish appears twice in the first and third paragraph.\nSo, the final answer is Clow", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "1) First, let's think about what the question is asking us to do.\n2) The question asks for the time it takes to do the entire tour, and it gives us all the necessary information to do this.\n\n3) Now, let's think through the problem carefully and answer the above question. \n4) The information given is that Manex has to drive to the destination and drive afterward going back to the starting.\n5) Thus, Manex has to drive 5 five miles and then 15 more afterward, which is 20 miles total. In two minutes of driving, 1 mile is driven, thus 20 miles in two minutes is 3.3 minutes of driving.\n6) The question asks for how long it takes Manex to do the entire tour. To answer this question, we have two factors: \n\nOne is the time it takes Manex to drive from the start to the destination.\n\nThe second is the time Manex spent at the destination, which is given as 2 hours, or 120 minutes. \n\nThus, the total driving time is $120/3.3$ = 36 minutes of driving time. \n\n7) The second factor is Manex's driving time back from the destination to the start.\n\nWe don't have any information about this. Thus, we will use assumptions in lieu of having all the information. \n\nAssume the drive that is 10 more miles farther takes the same 3.3 minutes as the drive to the destination.\nThen, the time it takes to get back from the destination is $(36 + 10)/3.3 = \\pm$ 10.7 more minutes. \n\nLet's say 10.7 minutes for convenience of the computation. \n\nSince Manex can travel 2 minutes for every mile and spent 2 hours at the site, this gives us the time to work with.\n\n8) Total Driving Time = $(120/3 + 10.7)*19$ = 30.51 minutes\n\n9) The answer to the question is 30.5 minutes to drive the entire tour.\n\nSo the final answer Is D: 30.5 min\n\nInput:What does P mean?

Therefore, the best logical guess is that these words must have come from one another. We can use this guess to find out the best description for the moon, by simply removing it from this line of reasoning. In this way, we discover that the moon is in \"synchron-ous\" orbit around the Earth.\nThe moon is in synchronous orbit around the Earth, as is the Sun, and the Earth is also in synchronous orbit around.\nWith this final answer, we arrive at the solution that the given word, \"synod\", can mean \"in orbit around one another\".\nHence, the correct answer is B, that the Sun, Earth and Moon have been in \"synod\" for 25,920,000 days or approximately 70,870,422,000 hours, or about half a month.\nSo, the final answer is B.\n\n Input: What is the ratio of the circumference of the sun to the diameter of the sun when viewed from the earth?

Subtract $9 from $1.50 to get the profit in dollars per chicken.\n\n4. Add $2 and $2 to $9 or $7.\n\n5. Add 3 and $1.50 or $4.50.\n\n6. Multiply the profit by the price of the chicken to get the total price of those chickens.\n7. Subtract the total price of the chickens from the profit.\n\nSolution Explanation: 1. We know the price of the chick, which is $1.50 and we know the amount of chickens he wants to sell for $65.\n2. To find the amount of chickies he wants to sell, you need to find where the profit is.\n3. We know that the profit is $ 65 and you can subtract this from the $1.50 in the formula for the profit to get how much you profit from a chick for $3.\n4. We know how much one bag of chick feed is, which is $2 and we are going to use it twice. That brings it to $4. \n5. Add 6x $3 because that is how much you would profit for selling the chick for $3 and multiply $4 by 6. \n6. Subtract the profit to get what that makes.\n7.

Solving for n and setting it equal to total invitees, it goes: 5+2x=0.2*(n+2*x).\n\n6. Subtracting the two sides by '0.2*x=1(n-x),and equating at n=x+1 is possible because x is an integer.\n\n7.

The math question then describes how many points he achieved in each game over a week.\n4. We now need to determine how many times he qualified for the reward and what his total score was.\n5. For each game, he got 30 or above points in two games, got a score under 30 points in three games, and got 32 or above points once.\n6. Therefore, we have that twice (in each of the first two games, he got 32 or under) and thrice (he scored less than 30 in one of the games) he didn't get paid but the other three times there was a payout.\n7. For three of the games, he did not achieve 30+ and in two, he scored more than 30.\n8. He scored 30+ in all but one game.\n9. We calculate the score of each game, which is 30+ or under 30.

{"text": "As the question states, Carla is driving a total distance of 32 miles to complete her journey. This means that her car is traveling the full length of 32 miles in one trip, and will return with at least 32 miles left at the end of her journey.\n\nNext, using the information provided, complete the trip. Carla is driving 8 miles to the store, 6 miles from the store to pick up her kiddos, an additional 12 miles home from school drop-off, and an additional 12+ miles for kiddos soccer practice. Therefore, her total trip would look like the following:\n8 miles x1 trip - 6 miles x 1 trip - 12 miles x 1 trip- 12+ miles x 1 trip\n\nWe know that there are 32 miles of total travel. This means that the last part of the journey will not be 12 miles because she will be able to complete her last trip with the remaining 32 miles left or less. Therefore, her total total drive will be 12 miles but she will have a remaining of at least 32-12 = 20 miles travel remaining at the end of her trip.\n\nNow that we have completed Carla trip in order, we can now calculate the miles driven in one trip. It would be 8 miles x 1-6 miles x 1 -12 miles x 2 - 12+ miles 2\nNext, we need to determine the number of total gallons Carla needs to fill her car with. In order to calculate the number of gallons, we multiply miles driven in one trip by gallons per mile her vehicle can travel according to the information given.

{"text": "The key step here is to consider the dog as a force that will make John run faster when it is being dragged.

John went for 30 miles and then for another 30 miles in total, so that is 60 miles in total. When he was both running and being dragged by the dog he traveled an additional 6 miles per hour, so he ran the second 30 miles in a total of 30mph + 6 = 36 miles. The 6 miles per hour increase corresponds to 1 mile per hour for each minute of the run, or 6 miles per hour per every 10 minutes.\nAdding the 30 miles and 36 miles results in 66 miles run overall.\n\nSubtract the extra 10 miles spent running with the dog during the first 30 minutes, so the total run was 56 miles. Adding that to the additional 6 miles per minute for the second 30 minutes totals 62 miles. The extra 1.7 miles (62 to 56) per second are from the extra 16 miles per hours for the 30 minutes the dog was dragging him which totals 9 minutes.\n\nThose 9 minutes resulted in 1 minute each for 90 miles, a total of 1.7 miles from an added speed of 16mph.\n\nSo the additional 1.7 miles per second are from the dog.\n\nThe 1.7 miles traveled by John when additionally running with dog for 9 minutes would be [1 minute x 90 (9 miles per minute because 9 miles/9 minutes).\n\n1 minute x 9 miles /minute = 9 miles in that minute.\n\n9 miles in that minute x 9 minutes = 81 miles added for dog run alone.\n\n81 miles added for John while running alone + 62 (John", "answer": " 5"}

We are not allowed to eat any combination of chicken, beef, and pork, implying that we cannot eat chicken and beef or beef and pork.\n4. We cannot eat pasta or pizza.\n5.

The answer to this rests on another clue hidden in the question, namely the presence of a unit.\nBy the use of the unit \"miles\" with \"a walk\", the implication is that all the walks are to be counted \"in miles\".\n\nA third clue is the fact that the question asks \"how many miles\", which implies that this unit is being asked and there can be no unit changes after an answer has been provided.\n\nHence, from the above set of clues, the correct interpretation of the question is as follows: How much would Clover walk in a 30-days cycle if it was 1.5 miles a day every day?\n\nHowever, before answering the question, one last point needs to be considered- Is the 1.5-miles walk going to be taken once per day, every day for 30 days or on 7 days, and the remaining days for 2.5 miles?\n\nIn the former, the total distance walked per day would be 3 miles, which equals 21 miles a day.\n\nIn the latter as each day is taken as a 1.5 mile walk then we take 7 days as (1.5*7=)10.5 mils walk.\n\nThen we have 135 miles for a single walker in whole 30 days.\n\nThe other answer is 3.1 mile per walker\n\nSo the final answer in this case 135/2 = 67.5 \n\nInput: What happens to babies at the end of their first year of life?\nOutput: 1:First year = 12 months\n2: The question asks about an event that happens at the end of the 12-month period\n3: A baby is a living being, and since this question focuses on an event that happens at a specific time (i.", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "1.'Julia worked for only 6 hours that day.' This indicates that Julia must have finished her work earlier than the normal eight hours, which means she has less time left to serve customers.\n2. 'Becky worked for 8 hours that day.' So it is clear that Becky also served the full eight hours she was scheduled to.\n3. 'Ann worked for 10 hours that day.' So Ann must have stayed longer than usual, and served more customers that day, probably by waiting on more customers after Becky had finished and because she had more time on her hands.\n4. Therefore, the sum of Ann, Becky, and Juli's customers served that day is 10 + 8 + 8 + 7 (Julia's shift hours) + 1 (Julia's total extra hours) = 40 customers.\n5.

For example: if he had a box of books and placed it on a scale, he would subtract the mass of the books (let's say 10 pounds) from the total scale weight, and then record the scale weight (10 pounds). The scale weight minus the mass of the box is the mass of the books inside that box. This is important because we are only allowed to add items with known masses onto the scale in this question.\nStep 2 (He brings the weight to 2 lbs with jelly beans)\nKen adds enough jelly beans so that it brings the scale weight up to 2 pounds. Since the mass of a jelly bean is known, we can calculate the amount of beans on the scale using the formula:\n\nAmount of jelly beans on the box = (2 pounds) / (10 grams) = 200 grams = 0.2kg\n\nStep 3 (He adds enough brownies to triple the weight)\nKen added enough brownies to the box to triple its weight.

{"text": "To solve the problem, we can use substitution to represent the quantities involved in the problem. To do this, we first determine the quantity, or value that we wish to represent in terms of another quantity. \nNext, we identify the variable that represents that quantity. In this problem, we wish to represent the number of dollars in our problem. The problem states that the total sale price is 15 times and the total cost is 5 times so the substitution we need to make is that the total dollar amount is 5 times the total quantity sold. The expression for this is y=5x and y represents the total dollars, x represents the number of total DVDs sold and the equation represents the substitution that will replace the number of total DVD sales. \nNext, if we wish to know how many DVDs are sold, we can substitute. y=5x to solve for x. Then we can use x = $60. This is one of the most important steps in our solution. We used substitution as represented in the expression y=5x and replace y by 15 and x by the solution, x = $60 to express the total number of dollars made in terms of the total number of DVDs sold.\nIn the problem it states that they sell 500 movable DVDs a day.

This equation indicates that every day of work puts John $80, totaling $160 dollars overall.\n\n4)Next, we want to consider the performance bonus. Every day gives him $60.

In this scenario, however, we have to first find out how many gallons of water we should leave for each fish. For one two-inch fish, we need 1 gallon of water, 3 inches of fish. We need 1 gallon for 1 inch of the second tank's fish. With the same logic, four inches of water are needed for the first tank's fish. This results in 48 gallons for the first tank. If you have 48 gallons and two inches worth of fish, 36 gallons are left for every third inch fish.\nIf this number of fish is combined with the original two-inch fish for one tank and the three-inch fish for the other tank, there would be 193 gallons and five inches of fish, and 363 gallons and fifteen inches of fish. 191/3 gallons are used to calculate the total gallons and 191-48-36= 91 or 91 gallons and 15 inches of fish.\nSo, if you were to have 2 inches worth of the fish in one tank and 3 inches worth of the fish, you would have 363 gallon worth of the third tank and 191 gallon worth of the first tank.

{"text": "1. The first thing we need to do is express the number of jelly beans in the jar. Since we only care about the number of red jelly beans in this question, we need to estimate the fraction of jelly beans which are red and subtract that fraction from the total number to determine the number of non-red jelly beans. \n2. The fraction of jelly beams which are red is equal to three fourths, since 4/4 of the jelly beams are red.\n3. There are 1/4 of the red jellybeans that are coconut flavor, meaning there are 750/4 = 187.5 red coconut jellybeans in the jar.\n4. Therefore, by subtracting the fraction of redness from the fraction of jellybeans in the whole jar, we are left with an equation for the number of jellybeans that are non-red, which is 6/4 = 1.5 jellybeans.\n5.

That gives us the value of the change we're looking for so\nthe answer for 7th question is 0 cents\n6)We go on knowing from $200 -$0= $200 and we know the money from the $200 is the total spent for the pizza party.\n7)If we use the knowledge we have that each drink box cost $6 and so each box of pizza cost $14 we can solve it for $14.\nSo for the 4th question it says each box of pizza.\nif we divide $14 by the number of boxes she bought 2 boxes 14 divided by 2=7.\nSo knowing the number of boxes was 10 boxes of the pizza and 5 boxes of drink we can subtract and divide, to get the value of each box of pizza which is $7 in change.\nSo The 4th question is $7 in change\nSo the answer to the third question is 0 200 in change.\nSo the remaining cents left for the 7th question is $0\n\n\n### Author(s)\n* [jhilol_00](https://github.com/jhilol_16)\n*[kishore899](https://github.instructure.com/kishore898)\n* [Diana ](https://", "answer": " 30"}

So, we would need to figure out the wholesale price (W) before the 20% markup.\n3. The markup is given by (W + Markup). Markup is 20%, W is 80% multiplied by Markup to set the retail (R), Markup = 20%, W = 0.8W = 0.8(16). W = 12.8\nIf W is 12.8, we can say 0.8W gives us R of 14.4 (16 x 20%), so.\n4. Markup would be the cost of clothes minus the cost of R at 14.4, so Markup is 12.4, so 0.8(Markup) would be $10.32 ($14.4 - $2 x 14.4 = $27, 12.4 subtracted from that and we get $10.3$.\n5. Therefore, the wholesale price is $10.3$(8.7).\nSo the final answer must be B: $8.79 (10.3/11.53).\nBut here is a simpler way to look at this.  \n80% of $16 is 12.7.  So $36 = $12.7 + $2.\nSo the mark-up is $3.6, and the wholesale price will therefore be $2.40.\nSo the final easier way is 80% of 16 is 132.08, Divide $132.0 by 16 and you'll get $8.5. Take.8 * 8.5 and add 2, and the final answer is $7.7+(2)\nInput: When is a man more interested in his car's gas mileage?

{"text": "We know that the total number of remaining candies is 27, and we can set up these equations:\nNellie can eat n candies\nJacob can eat \\(\\frac{n}{2}\\)\nLana can eat \\(\\frac{5}{6}\\) \\(\\frac{n}{3}\\)\nNow, to solve, subtract the equations for Jacob and Lana to get \\(\\frac{n}{6}=\\frac{2n}{6}+1\\) Now, to get the numbers of remaining candies, we set each person's number of the remaining candies equal to this equation. Then, use the fact that for each person, \\(\\frac{n}{7+1}\\) represents the number of remaining sourballs they have.

{"text": "1) The given question can be broken down into a series of facts:\n   - The widget factory has 3 workers, each of which can assemble one complete widget every 10, 15, and 1 minute respectively. \n   - Sam, the fastest worker (who can assemble one complete widget in 10 minutes) can assemble 60 widgets in one hour. This is based on him working for one hour.\n   - Jack, the second fastest worker (who assembles one complete widget in 20 minutes), can assemble 30 complete widgets in one hour (the same as Sam).\n   - Tony, the slowest worker (who assembls one complete widget in 30 minutes), can assemble one complete widget at a time in 1/15 of an hour. (i.e., 30/15 = 1)\n2) Now, we need to use this information to convert the number of complete widgets made in a day to convert the number of hours Sam, Jack, and Tony worked to convert the number of widgets made that day to convert the number (68) of widgets that the workers had completed in a day to the number of total working hours that the workers worked to the number of working minutes that the workers had.\n3) So in order of highest to lowest priority:\n   - First calculate the working hours of Sam. We know Sam can make one complete widget in 60 minutes, so we can split the total 1680 minutes (of which Sam worked 60) into 60 parts: (60/1680)*60 = 3.72 hours. Thus, Sam worked: 4.5 * 4 * 3.72 = 88 of the 1680 total minutes.\n   - Next, calculate the working hours of Jack, who can make one complete widget every 20 minutes. We know Jack can make one complete widget per 4 hours, so we split the total 1040 minutes (of which Jack worked 4) into 40 parts: (40/1040)*4 = 1.017 hours. This means Jack worked: 20 min x 2 = 40 of the 1660 total widget factory minutes.\n   - Finally, calculate the working minutes for Tony.", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "The first step in working on this question is to identify the information given about Jonah's fruit purchase. We know that Jonah bought 6 pints for $3 each and that each pint can be cut into 10 pineapple rings.\n\nNext, we need to work out what Jonah's profit will be when he cuts the fruit and sells it.\n\nThe cost per single piece of cut fruit will be $1/piece.\nBecause the individual pineapple rings can be sold for $5 each, the profit per ring is $4.25 ($5 - $0.75, the cost of cutting the fruit).\n\nBecause Jonah sells 4 rings per purchase, this means that for every fruit cut into rings, Jonah makes $1 in profit.\n\nThe final step is to identify how many rings Jonah has left after selling the original 4 rings.\nSince the last four remain, Jonah has 6 rings to sell at $5 each. This yields a profit of $30.\n\nThus, Jonah makes a total profit of $33 after selling the 4 rings and cutting the remaining fruit.\n\nHere is the sequence of steps:\n\n1. Identify the information given about Jonaha\ufffd\ufffds fruit purchase: \n\n    He bought 6 pineapple for $3\n\n2. Identify how much the profit is when he cuts the purchased fruit and sells it: \n\n    Profit = $5 - cost\n\n    In this case, the cost of cutting is $0.75\n\n    Thus, profit = $4.25\n\n3.

{"text": "A question of this type typically will contain some kind of formula, or ratio type of question. But these questions often use units of measure for the different things being measured.\n1. Considering all the information given, a simple way of solving this is to compare the leakage rate of the large hole to that of the medium sized hole as you know their respective rates, and subtract the medium from the large to get the rate of the medium sized one. So the rate of medium sized hole is 1/2 of the rate of large hole\n2. So the rate of the medium is 1/2 * 3 = 1.5\n3. We then know the rate of large hole.  However, we still do not know the rate of the smallest.  However, we know the difference between the rates of large and medium is 2.5, and their rate ratios are  1 and 2 so  2.5 is approximately 2. As the smallest hole is 1/3 the size of medium, the smallest rate should be 1/3 * 2 = 0.6\n4. Therefore the rate of the smallest hole should be 0.6  And with that information, we can simply substitute and solve for the total amount of water. 1/2 * (1/2 * 4/3) + 1/3 * (1/2*4/3) +  0.6 * (1/2   *  4/3) = 4.8 ounces of water.", "answer": " 600"}

From this, if Donna have six times more bananas than Dawn, then Lydia must have 100 banana's, which is twice as many bananas than Dawn. But Dawn only have 140 bananas (or twice as many as Lydia). Because Lydia has more bananas than Daawn, it follows that Lydia's two bananas are half of Dawn's 200 (or 2.5* Dawn). But Dawn had 140, so that means that Lydia has 25.

If we know that he ate a 'bag of chips' earlier, we know he ate three bags, and the question now boils down to how many he actually ate after his meal.\n8.

{"text": "This is a standard type 2 question and it is an easy solve. We know that the first day's collection was 50, 2nd day's collection was x, and 3rd day's collection was y + 50.\nWe can eliminate a few choices:\nC: Tins is not used as a unit of measurement.\nB: 54 is not divided by 2\nA: 57 is not divisible by 3\n\nNow we know the answer is some value of 240. But we are given the following condition:\nIf he collects an equal\nnumber of tins on the\nremaining days of the\nweek, what's the\nnumber of tins he\ncollected each day for\nthe rest of the week? Now the question states that the days that follow the 3rd day will be equal to that amount he collects each day. Let assume the answer to x is 240. Then we can restate the question as the following:\nFor the rest of the week, the days will be equal to 240. Now, we know he collect a lesser number of tins than 240 on the 3rd day. The question does not state the rest of the week would be a sum of all the days less than 240. Instead, what it would imply is that the sum of next 7 days should be equal to 3240. Consider if he collects 240 on Monday and the rest of the week is equal to 245. The total for the week would be 240 + 245 which does not sum to 324. Therefore, the answer must be the least possible number that allows you to collect 3240 each week. The answer must be the least number that adds up to 324 and at the same time allows you collect 240 on Day 1. The answer can be 259 which is the product of 3 and the remainder of 7 when divided by 4 (since the number of days in a week is 7).

{"text": "1. We are looking at how much should be sold to make a profit of a percentage of each bag of corn. The question makes it clear that the amount of corn is 10 bags, so we have all the information we need.\n2. The question is asking us how much should be sold, or how many bags should be sold. This is to avoid selling too much and not selling enough. So we need to find the solution which will cover the 35 and 15 expenses as well as make sure to make a profit of at least 10%.\n3. We can see how much and how little we are able to earn since we have both our expenditure and our revenue. So we have to figure out these values and find their common denominator before we can divide them and get our answer.\n4. We can see clearly from our values that we spent $40 on fertilizing and pesticides. Which means we spent $40 * 0.1 = $0.40 as a total, leaving $35 before taxes. On the other hand, we did make $2 * 0.10 = $0.20 as a total from our work before taxes, leaving $5.5 * 0.1 is $1 * 0.1 before taxes. We then want $5 before taxes, so this means we made $6 before taxes.\n5. Now that we know exactly how much we earned and spent, as well as the expenses we had, we will be able to divide them up. We can see that we need at least $200 before taxes to cover our labor as well as our sales and still make a decent profit of 10%. Then, we know exactly what amount we have to sell to make that happen.\n6. This means that to make a profit of $10 for every bag of corn, we have to make at least $20 * 0.9 = $20 and we have at least $30 to make that happen. When we subtract the 30 from the sum of the $10 of profit that we want, we get $20, leaving us with the answer of $20.\nSo the final choice is 10 b/1.1 to the power of 2.\nSo the final answer should be 20.", "answer": " 11"}

Therefore, there can only be 30(^5) (3^5) horses in the problem. \n5) Each horse can only walk 3 meters at a time, so to find 30(^3) horses in a problem, it is easy to multiply by 10, as horses have a maximum walking distance of 30*3 meters, which is 90 meters when walking across.

The next option, seven, is divisible by 3, so it is not a prime number.\n3. The fourth option, 11, is divisible by both 3 and 7, so is not a prime number either.\n4. The fifth option, 13, is not divisible by 3 or 7, so it is a 2-digit (i.e., a 2-digit number), and thus, we can find the largest prime number using factorization.\n5. In 13, the number 3 appears once, so 13 will have three factors: 1 and 13.\n6.

(D5 can hold any number.) Choices:  A - any number B - nothing C - 55 D - 50E - 100\nOutput: The answer is B: nothing.\nThe statement can be rewritten like this:\n\"What number should be entered into Cell D5 in order that a cell in Row 5 with the same values in the Row (Cell D5) equals the value of 55 in the row?\n(D5 can hold any value)\"\n\nThe answer to this mathematical problem can be derived by applying the rules of logic and pattern recognition.\n1. We can assume that the values in Cell D5 are the same for the entire row, since the question doesn't specify otherwise. It makes sense that this would be the case since the problem does not have a specified range.\n2. We can also assume that there is no restriction on the values of Cell D5.\n3. Therefore, we can assume that the question is asking about the value of Cell D5, and not the value of any other cell in the row.\n4. We know that the value of the entire row in Cell D5 is 55. What we don't know is what that value is at Cell D5.\n5. There are three cases to consider where the value of the entire range is known.\n6. Case 1: if the value of the entire column is known.\n7. The value of Cell D5 in this scenario is 1+(4*55). This is because if the value of the column total is 55, Cell D5 will sum up to 55, thereby contributing to the total of 100.\n8. Case 2: if we only know the value of the entire entire row.\n9. Cell D5' total is (15+10+6+1+4+3+5+9)(55*6)/100= (15*55*6)/(100*7)", "answer": " 520"}

I've chosen to assume a little extra detail that's not explicitly stated in the question. If it turns out to be wrong, I'll leave a comment on the question.\n\nLet's break the question down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n\n#### Part 1: Calculating the weight of the plates.\n\nThe question tells us that Tom is using 10 weights that each weigh 30 pounds.\n\n  1. If each 10 weights each weigh 36 pounds total, each weight is 3.6 pounds.\n\n  2. If each 15 weights each weigh 54 pounds total, each weight would be 3.6 pounds (again, not explicitly stated, I'm just saying that it might be what the problem wants.)\n\n#### Part 2: Answering how much each plate feels to be lowered.\n\nBecause the machine adds 20% extra weight to each plate, Tom is actually doing 45-pound weights on each plate. That would be 4.5 for the first set, and 6.0 for the other set.\n\nSo the weights felt 45 pounds.\n\nSo by solving for two parts, we can solve for the entirety of the problem.

{"text": "1. First, we see that there are two conditions in the expression. We will start with the first one.\n\n2. The expression 2 times as tall means that Anne and her sister have a height difference of 2 units (e.g. 2cm, 2m, 2ft)\n\n3. Next, we see the expression \u201cBella is 3 times\u201d which says that Bella has a height difference of 3 units from Anne\u2019s sister.\n\n4. Therefore, Anne\u2019s height difference from her sister is 2units, and Bella\u2019s height difference from Anne\u2019s sister is 3units.\n\n5. Now, Anne\u2019s expression is 80cm. To find the height difference between Bells height and Anne\u2019s sister\u2019s height, we must subtract their expressions. \n\n6. Substituting Bella's expression for Bella's height (3times 80cm) we get 240 cm.\n\n7. Subtracting Anne\u2019s expression 80cm from Bella\u2019s expression, we get 160cm.\n\n8. Therefore, the height difference between Bell\u2019s height and Anne\u2019s height is 60cm.\nSo the final step is to take the value of the height difference (60cm)and subtract it from the greater value (240cm)to get the height difference between the sister and Anne's sister: 180cm. Hence, the final answer is A) Her sister is 180cm taller than Anne.\nSo the final answers are: A) Her sister is   180cm talleer than Anne.\n\nInput: What happened when the farmer bought a mule?

{"text": "1) The question requires a solution to an arithmetic problem and asks how much Janet will owe in wages, and taxes for one-month.\n2) Let us define the following variables.\n```\nhourly_wages -- the hourly wages earned by an employee\nnumber_of_employees_per_month -- the number of employees that work for Janet per month\ntax_percentage -- the tax rate that Janet pays on her workers' income\ntotal_tax_cost -- this is the total tax cost and will be denoted as 'tax'\ntotal_salaries -- this is the sum of all hourly wages of employees\nhourly_work_day -- this is the number of hours an average employee works per day\ntotal_work_days -- this is the number work days in a month\n```\n\n3) We can solve the problem using an easy rule of thumb called the formula for calculating taxes paid on earned income. This formula is the following:\n```\ntax_cost = (number_of_w2_form_entries) x [ (earned_income/100)^2 x 1.45% \n```\nThis formula is a rule of thumb for calculating the percentage of tax on income for individuals earning $9,825 and below.\nThis formula is the same as calculating the FICA tax paid and is based on how many entries are on a w-2 form tax return. Individuals with more than ten entries are considered to be earning large amounts of money compared to the average person.\n4) Applying this formula, we can use the following steps to arrive at the answer to the problem.\n\na) We know the total number of employees who work for Janet. It's six.\n\nb) It is given that the six employees are working an average of 25 hours/workday and 8 hours/workday. We can represent this as follows:\n[25] / [8] = 3 days (which I will call d) \n\nc) Janet's payroll is $96/hour (or $960 in total/day) for employees and $12/hour (or $120/day) for management.

This can be inferred to mean that he is working a lot more than in a typical week, which would increase his hourly wage.  Consider this rule for the number of hours worked with regard to the normal rate for an individual:\n\n$12 per hour = $72 per every 6 hours.\n\nConsider the following formula, $696 / 1.5 \u00d7 $72, which means that if one person works for every 6 hours, he or she makes as much as 1.5 times someone else.

{"text": "1. First, we are given a description of Pat's picnic and some numerical information about the contents of her basket. We are asked how much of each item should be allotted per person in the family to ensure that each person gets the same amount of each item.\n2. The number of cookies per person is 42/7 = 6, which is the remainder when 42 is divided by 7. Similarly, the number of candy bits per person is 63/7, which is 9. Similarly, the number 21 brownies per person is 21/7 = 3. These numbers are all rounded to a single number if necessary.\n3. Now, we know that each person is allotted the same number of cookies and the same number of pieces of candy to ensure that each person is given an equal amount of each item. We are also told that Pat has 42 cookies and that she has 21 unused pieces of chocolate to use as brownies.\n4. We could write down the information the problem gives us and solve for the number of people and the total number of items in our basket in two separate but related, simpler problems.\n5. The first can be simplified to 'if x is the total number of cookies and candy in the basket, and x is evenly distributed to n people, then the total number of cookies in the basket is x/n and the total number of candy pieces is x/n + 1 (since there are two possible ways to assign x pieces to n people).\n6. The second problem states that x is the total number or cookies and candy in Pat's basket and n = 7. In solving this problem, we know that the number of cookies has to be shared by seven people, so: x is the total number and n = 7, which is what the question wants us to solve.\n7. The next step is calculating x, which is the total number of items, so we know that x = 42/n = 42/7, which is equal to 6.\n8. This result tells us that Pat has 6 cookies (since 42/7 is 6, which is a remainder when 42/7). The last sentence of the question states that she also has 21 brownies that she can't use.

B: This is a land that is cultivated for agricultural use. This could be a field, orchard, or any other type of farm. It is planted with plants and crops.\n3. C: This refers to the prairie, which is a large grassland that features long grasses and usually a very sparse mixture of other vegetation. They are found in regions with cold climates and high rainfall.\n4. D: The mountains refer to a type of landscape that features tall hills or peaks of rock formations above sea level, with sloping areas leading down to areas where there is no elevation. The mountains will have snow, trees, and other plants or animals that can live in that height of elevation.  \n5. E: The final choice is no trees. The question says that there are no trees on any specific type of land, which rules out the choices of desert, farmland, and prairie. \n6. Therefore, the option that is correct is D: mountains.

{"text": "1) First, understand that this question is asking for the total weight that the person (Anne) is carrying, using the two cat reference in a mathematical sense rather than in a literal sense, i.e., the cats are not actually carried on Anne's body.\n\n2) The statement 'cat weighs 2 kg,' means the cat weighs exactly 2 kg. \n\n3) Considering the statement'male cat is two times heaviest than female cat' (the answer), the key is to determine how to 'carry' a cat that is two times the weight of the other cat.\n   \n4) Carrying 'two times heavier' can be understood with respect to the mathematical statement 'A is two times heavier than B.' \n\nFor example, in this case, assume that one cat weighs 1 kg (called A) and the other cat weighs 0.5 kg (called B). \n\nUsing this as context, it can be understood that 'A is two times the weight than B' would mean that two times the heavier of A is two times the heavier than two times the heavier is the heavier than B as A is two times heavier now\n\nConsidering that we know that one of the cats weighs 2kg (called A), we understand that 'two times the heavier of two times the heavier' can be interpreted as four times the heavier, which means two times the weight of two times the heaviest cat, which is the male cat (not the female cat). \n\n5) Two times two equals four (the mathematical basis for the meaning of the statement 'two times heavier'). The woman is carrying two times two, or four times the weight of male cat. That means the man is carrying four times the weight. \n\n6) Considering that the female cat weighs two kg, and that the man cat is two times heavy, then each cat is two times heaviness of the other one. So the woman has to carry one cat four times its weight, i.e., four times one two kg cat, which is equivalent to eight kg of a cat).\n\n7) Finally, the total weight she has to carry is one female cat, plus one times eight (times) its weight, or eight kg in total.\nSo the final weight of cats being", "answer": " 6"}

Choices: 1. Asia and Europe 2. Europe and Asia 3. North America and Europe 4. North America and Asia 5. North America and South America\nOutput: 1). The first word from the question itself suggests that it is about continents.\nContinents are large masses of land connected together by water.\n2). The second option, Europe and Asia, cannot be considered because they are in different continents\n3). The remaining four options fall under the umbrella of one continent: North America.\n4). North America has the second biggest population on Earth, second only to Asia.\n5). A lot of cities around the world are in North America, which makes sense because it is the second largest continent by this measurement.\n6). The most densely populated nation in North America is the United States, and it has the third-highest population of any nation on Earth.\n7). The densest sub-region of this continent is Alaska, which is the largest and most sparsely populated part of the continental United States.\n8). Hence, North America has a high human population and a lot of cities and the most urbanized area is Alaska.\n9).

I pay $160/mo to be there\"  Thus, John is paying $160 per month in rent.  This line of text indicates that the space was \"something\" before it was empty and John moved into his office there, implying that it was an occupied space such as a business.  This is what is expected based on what is already said in the text, so this line provides important information in finding what will work/what does not work as a calculation.\n\nThe text then continues to state that 2000 business cards were printed so that John could pass them out and promote the website.

{"text": "This problem's key to solving it is making change to cents on the given amounts.  So we should use a pencil and paper to make the required changes so we can work out the correct answer.\n\nLet's take one example:\nBuying a toaster for $99.  The toaster costs 99 cents less than the original amount.  So if you subtract $100 from the original amount, you will get $69 in change, which is $30 from the original amount.\n\nIn each subsequent change, the number being added to the original to get to the new price should be multiplied by 10 until it reaches 100.\n\nWhen we apply this to our example, we come to this: The toaster is sold for $100 and buying a new bike costs $80. We start with the original total of $3000, subtract $80 and add $20 to get $790, subtract $700 to get $690, add $33 (70 x 0.5), subtract $15 (150 x 0.8), add $40 (50 x 0,8), adding $144 (70 x 2.0).\nThe total amount is $677.  We add $30 to get $707.  Then you need to subtract $790 and you should get $61.  But if you subtract $700 and add $30, you will get $95.

{"text": "First, note that we are given an array of information, and we are asked to find an answer.\n1. John writes 3 stories each week. This means that he writes 3 stories every day of the week.\n2. He each short story is 5 pages, and he writes 3 stories each day, which implies that he writes 3\u00d75 (5 pages) stories each week.\n3. In addition, he writes a novel that is over 1,200 pages each month because a ream of paper can only hold 500 pages. This means that 3\u00d75 stories per week cannot be written in a single ream, so he need to write those stories in additional sheets of paper on top of the reams or buy additional reams.\n4. To find the number of reams of paper need to buy, simply multiply 3 (number of stories John writes each week) times the number of pages per story (5) and the number of weeks (12).\n5. This gives us 1800 sheets of paper.\n6. To find the number reams of paper needed to buy, we need to divide 1800 by 3 which gives us 600.\n7. We need to purchase 600 reams of paper because one ream can hold 500 sheets of paper, which means that each ream would need to make a paper of 3 stories which can only be 2 pages per story (5 stories per ream* 5 pages per story).\nSo the final answer to the question is E: 600 ream, and John needs to buy 600 reems of paper.\nSo the final paper is D2 : 600 reem.\n\nInput:What do gymnasts stretch to prevent injury?

Antonio and his family are eating a total of 125 meatballs, which will require 4 pounds of ground beef.  According to the recipe, the weight of each meatball must be 1/7th or less than one pound by using our meatball to hamburger ratio of 1.25 per meatball.  For our math problems, we'll round both weights down to pounds. There are exactly 12.5 meatballs for each pound of ground beans.  Since Antonio has 125 meatbals prepared, 125 x 12.5 provides us with 1,562.5 pounds of meatballs.  Thus, Antonio needs four 4-pound bags of ground beef for his recipe.\nThis means that Antonio will not be able to have 12.5 servings (1 meatball and 1.25 meatballs respectively) for himself. If Antonio has 8 helpers, each helper is able to have 1.5 servings. If each meatball has 1.25 beans, the number of meatballs will be higher than it.

{"text": "The question is a little confusing, but the main information here is that there is a sheet, there are red and blue notes, each red note is next to 2 blue notes, and there are at least 10 more blue notes at the bottom of the sheet.\nThere is the information that the red notes come in a 5x6 grid. This can be easily reorganized into a vertical 5x10 or 6x15 grid.\n\nWe know that there is an equal number of red and blue notes. If we multiply the 2 numbers on the left side of a grid by 6, we get that the total number of notes on the left side of each grid, including 10 more at the bottom, is 30.\n\nWe can also calculate the number of notes on the right-hand side. If we multiply the number of red notes in each row by 15, we get 90.\n\nThus it is the case that there are 90 red/10 blue notes on the right in total.\n\nAt the beginning of the question, we are told that Jake will be putting all the red notes in the red bin and all of the blues in the blue bin. As a result, the blue bin will have a total of 160 blue notes and 10 extra notes at the bottom, for a total of 170 notes. Therefore the red bin will have 45 (90-85) red notes and 10 blue note at the bottom, for 55 notes.\n\nThus, the total number of notes is 90+55+170 = 315. \n\nSo the final answer to the question is D: 315", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "Tony wants to make the longest rope possible and is collecting all the rope he can to do so.\n\nOne of the things you can do is to find the total length of the ropes that have been given and sum it. This gives you the total length of the original rope as 35 feet (8 ft + 20 ft + 3 x 2.0 ft + 7 ft).\n\nNext, when you count the knots, you see a loss of 1.2 feet per knot. So you can subtract 6 ft from the 35 ft (35-6= 30 ft). Now that you have this, you know that Tony will be using these 30ft of rope and 2ft pieces. So you need 32ft more to reach to the 3 ft in his hand.\n\nThese 32 ft rope has to be 28 ft long. Now if you find that the number of knots Tony made can be 28 - 6, which is 22.\n\nFinally you know that each knot will reduce you by an average of 1.2 ft per knot.\n\nThus you know that each knots will shorten you by 2 ft, so total will be the number of knots x 2 ft.\n\nThis means 22 knots will reduce the overall length by 44 ft. Now you have to add this to the final length gained. So you have 30 ft + ( 44 ft - (6ft /1.2 ft) )\n\nIf you subtract the 6 ft, then add 3 ft to the number 4, you get 43.

You spend all the money in the package. The socks cost $10 and each pair of underwear costs $5. By selling the 3 pairs 3 times how much money do you make?\nOutput:The first step in approaching this problem would be to determine the cost of each item in the given scenario. The cost of the socks can be determined by multiplying the number of socks by their cost of $10, which equals $50 for 5 pairs. Similarly, the total cost for the 3 pairs of underpants can be computed by multiplying their cost of $5 ($15) by the number of pairs ($3).\n\nOnce these costs have been determined, the next step would be to determine the profit from selling the items. Let\u2019s say the socks are sold for $12 and the underpants are sold for $8.

Thus we know that there is nothing wrong with the answer options.\n3) From the given answer choices, if the person is able to distinguish the difference between human body parts (A: Human Heart), Human Organs (B: Human Liver), and Human Organ systems (C: Human Lungs), then the best choice to choose is \"human organ system\". Here \"Organ system\" is a systemic biology term and \"Organ\", is a Biology term (Biology is not limited to Humans, it studies all living things in detail).\n4) It is a fact, that human liver is an organ. As a human organ system is a more general term then Human Liver.\n5) So, the best answer is: \"F: Human liver\"\n6) It is because as per Biology textbooks, It is a human body structure for performing a specific function. It is also a group of several tissues that work for a single biological process. For example - Digestion, Excretion...etc\n7) Hence answer is F: Human liver.\nSo the final conclusion is F: Human livers\n\nInput: Do you want to have your mind blown?

Choices: A: a sacred object that housed a god or hero B: an area in a temple dedicated to a particular god C: a place of worship and worshipers D: an elaborate religious place of an ancient Greek E: a place where an image is placed\nOutput: 1.) Shrine originally referred to a sacred Roman temple. \n2.) A sacred place would have been dedicated to a god or hero, such as the god of war or the hero Theseus. \n3.) These places would have contained statues of that god or hero, and they may have been called shrines afterward. \n4.) As the meaning of shrine evolved, it came to refer to a small room full of devotees, such as the room where monks study the bible. \n5.) Modern usage differs from these early meanings, though, with the primary meaning of shrine now referring to an elaborate religious place devoted to a particular deity. \n6.) A place of worship would have houses many priests, and its devotees would have made many pilgrimages to it. \n7.) Modern usage also implies that shrines should be simple and beautiful, as they hold religious significance to their congregants.\n8.) We can therefore dismiss shrines D and E.\n9.)

For any job, there are various skills that are necessary to perform the job well.\n3. The skills required for a music critic may include musical knowledge, critical thinking abilities, and strong writing skills, among others.\n4. Let's compare the provided options to the skills that may be needed to work as a music critic and analyze their suitability:\n5. Restaurant, bakery, theatre, and clerking would require different skills from those needed to work as a critic, since they are jobs with different requirements.\n6. It's unlikely that the job of a restaurant worker could have directly prepared them to work as a music writer. \n7. Similarly, it's also unlikely that a clerking job would directly prepare them for that role. \n8.

{"text": "can a person most likely meet a celebrity?  Choices:  A; airport B; park C; beach D; club E; gym\nOutput: 1.) The text tells us that a person can meet a celebrity, anywhere they choose, so this tells us something about the nature of this question. - It needs something specific, like airport, beach or park because celebrities can be found anywhere.\n2. The following statement is an important clue to the nature of this question: 'So go ahead, put your name on the list and you're guaranteed at least one sighting.' - The quote suggests that it is possible for a regular person to meet a celebrity, even though they may not be a VIP or a high-profile contact.\n3. This is different to other questions which typically involve'spots' that celebrities frequent, like clubs or restaurants. This question is different because it says people can actually meet any celebrity at these other places, but the question is looking for a non-celebrity location where people can actually meet a celeb.\n4. Therefore, the answer must be a location where a person wouldn't normally be able to meet a special celebrity.\n5. Since, 'Airport and Park' are locations one wouldn't normally associate with a celebrity. 'Gym' is also a place where celebs may come, but it doesn't 'feel' right because its not a place where people are actually celebrity-spotters.\n6. Therefore we need to choose from options 1, 3 or 5:\n7. The celebrity's purpose is to 'have a relaxing day'. Therefore, choosing a place that isn't so crowded or 'full on' isn't what they are looking for.\n8. So, 'Club' doesn't work, just as 'Bed' or 'Museum'.\n9. There's no reason a celebrity couldn't do something to relieve their stress or tension. Therefore, choosing 'Hotel' is too straightforward.\n10. We have narrowed it down to two options: Option B - park and Option E - gym. These both fulfill the conditions of being places where celebrities would just not expect to be seen.\n11. 'Gym' might feel a little more random than 'Park'", "answer": " 220"}

Choices: 1. Cut more, eat less 2. Reduce his intake of calories 3. Eat more, exercise less 4. Increase his calorie intake 5.

When you divide your pizza you get more pieces!

In house there is no place for it, so, we can reject it.  \nb) Markets are very well known places for buying and selling commodities but toothbrushes are used to maintain teeth, to be more specific oral health, so, we can easily reject it.  \nc) The option Hotel. It may be related but the way it is related is not clear. Hotels are also well known for selling toothbrushes but the main thing is that the toothbrushes we use are our personal so they cannot be given to some other person to use.

Let's list the weather conditions available in these places. (Weather information is available at the Weather.com website, and can be cross-checked easily.)\n3. Aruba, Caribbean and Hawaii are located in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and they all enjoy very pleasant ocean weather as they are far away from the extreme temperatures of both poles. The South is located in the Southern Hemisphere.\n4. The Caribbean enjoys a warm climate throughout the year. It experiences slightly cooler winters than the northern areas, but on average, it is warm, and there is little variation in the temperature throughout the year.\n5. Hawaii enjoes a very mild winter, with a slightly cooler summer. The temperature in Hawaii rises up to a maximum temperature of 85\u00b0F in the summer and reaches a minimum of 65\u00b0F in winter.\n6. Aruba has year-round, tropical weather. It has a warm climate (minimum temperature of 65\u00b0 to maximum temperature of 100\u00b0 F) as there is no seasonal variation. Humidity, on average, ranges between 33% and 76%.\n7. The South is located south of the Antarctic Circle (a line that passes through the southernmost point of the earth at 90\u00b0 south latitude). Therefore, the South has icy cold weather as it experiences the coldest winters on earth (a minimum temperature of -59 \u00b0F to a maximum of 32 \u00b0F). Its summer is warm.\n8. Therefore Aruba gets the best weather with its year-round weather, making it the best possible place to travel to for best weather.\n9. Hence, Aruba gets the best climate with its warm weather all year round and hence, the answer is \"B: Aruba\".\nSo the final answer was B: Aruba\n\nInput: Which of the following would NOT be an issue to talk to teenagers about?

{"text": "did the first tattoo in the United States come from? Choices:  B: San Fancisco C: Chicago D: Alcatraz E: LA\nOutput: 1.. The question asks about the first tattoo ever to come from the United States. \n2. The given options - San Francisco, Chicago and Alcatraz - can't be the first tattoo. \n3. The question, on the other hand, gives two clues - it mentions the United States and tattoos, the latter of which suggests a location or practice peculiar to the country.\n4. Furthermore, there's an anagram, or rearranged word, in the sentence - Alcatraz. \n5. Since Alcatraz rhymes with 'tattoo', it's likely to be the answer.\n6. When one adds Al on the end of the word 'tattoo', the spelling becomes San Francisco - the same city that's mentioned after the question.\n7. Thus, the answer must be in some variation of Alcatraz and the most logical answer is the shortened version, which is - Chicago,\nSo the final answer was C: Chicago\n\nInput: The old man put a lot of thought into a gift for his friend.

{"text": "does an iceberg do a majority of its melting? Choices:  B: surface c: water D: top E: sea floor\nOutput: One of the main reasons why iceberg melts is due to the sun. So, when solar radiation enters the water layer it melts the ice. However, the sun rays are scattered and more or less absorbed by the top layer of the world, so the temperature there is higher than a few hundred feet down where there is less sunlight. Water at the surface is also heating up due to conduction from the sea floor. This means that it is only logical to answer this question. There are more chances for melting ice close to the surface or at it, rather than farther down, below the surface.\n5. The option C, doing it in water is logical because ice is a form of water, and water is warmed up by conduction at the top of the world. \n6. This means that if the ice is warm, then most of the melting will happen there. \n7. The option D is false because the temperature below the surface is much lower than at the top of the planet which means it may not cause a majority of melting. \n8. The same principle is applied to the option E, sea floor, because at the sea floor temperature is much lower than at sea level. So, melting of ice may occur there. However, it is not the majority.\n9. Therefore, the answer must be the one where majority of melting happens at E, sea floor.\nSo the final option is E: sea floor.\n\nInput: There's no need, I can't remember what the big city was called.

Also it may vary depending on the mariner to be warned of.  \nOutput: 1-2: 3rd statement says that lighthouse is placed depending on the mariner for which warning is to be given. \n2-1: Since a lighthouse is built to warn sailors of danger, it is likely to be placed on a hill top or other high area for its high visibility from seas. \n1-3: 1st statement says that it is a structure to warn sailors of impending danger. \n3-1: So logically lighthouse is placed to warn sailors for whom mariner is not mentioned. \n3-2: We will rule out the option, place lighthouse on a hill top because of ambiguity, whether option statement says mariner to be warner of danger or mariner for whom lighthouse is to be placed. \nSo the final answer in OA is 3.\n\nInput: He'd done his homework. he wasn't afraid of what would happen.

Choices:  a) Home and Garden store B) Costco C) Grocery store D) Baskin Robbins E) Farm Stand\nOutput: 1.`Baskin Robbins' is a well known brand of ice cream but isn't associated with pumpkin.\n2.

Choices:  (1) Only when you ask for directions (2) Only when you check (3) Only when your phone stops working (4) Only when you are too tired to check (5) Only when you ask the airline for help\nOutput: 1) The most likely scenario according to the context suggests that red, green, and orange traffic lights appear in front of you. There are people at a crossroad waiting for the green light. None of the people can see how far the traffic light is at a glance. 2) When the people who are waiting have their mobile phones with them, they often check the traffic light with their mobile phone when the red light begins. They make a difference between red or green based on what they see. 3) In this scenario, the traffic light does not remain functional, and your phone stops working. 4) You are in a hurry and you are too tired to look at the traffic light one more time and make an educated guess about which part will the green light glow on the intersection. 5) It is very late at night and your flight has reached.

(3) Here again the month or the week or the season does not matter for black to stay black. (4) Only black has been mentioned which suits the month, week or the season but not mentioned so far.\nSo the final conclusion would be option (4).", "answer": " 347"}

{"text": "does the word 'ad' come from? Choices: 1. A: 'at' 2. B: 'after' 3. C: 'add' 4. D: 'describe' 5. E: 'to'\nOutput: 1917: Before the end of 1917, a letter in a newspaper would be called \"an advertisement\". 1930: In early 1930, \"ads\" were used by ad companies to describe their business cards more casually. \n2. Today, \"ad\" is still used as an abbreviation for something similar, but it's more common to call something \"an ad\" than \"an advertisement\u201d. \n3. Nowadays, \"ad\" isn't used at all because it no longer makes sense. \n4. It was created to mean \"for ad\" instead of \"for advertisement\".\n5. An advertisement is more of an informative and persuasive type of advertising. \n6. For example, \"Addition\" or \"Subtraction\". \n7. The second word in those two examples will still work as the beginning in 2019 but not in 2010 even when added is replaced. \n8. The next word will still work now but not in 25 years when add will be replaced.\n9. In these cases, the second word will no longer mean \"the next one\u201d. \n10. \"Advertisement\" can only be shortened to \"avert\" in a limited way.\n11. \"Advertising\" can't be replaced with \"adv\" which might be replaced with \"ad\" in less than 20 years.\n12. \"Advertisements\" don't exist in the media.\n13. \"Advertising campaign\" is also the right way to call something \"with ads\" or \"of ads\". \n14. In English, it makes the same sense to say, \"Add this to your order\" as it does to say, \"Advertisement this to your campaign\".\n15. It might be fun to say, \"Ad\" is no longer the second word of \"Advertisement\". But, this new word \"add\" doesn't exist in the vocabulary", "answer": " 180"}

According to https://nrlmaps.ciis.edu/maps/CALIFORNIA/oilandgas.html, the offshore and inland regions of California do not consist of any major oil deposits.\n5) Next let\u2019s check option e) inland. According to the given options, we see that 'inland' refers to a large region that is located in the northern and central parts of California. \n6) Inland regions are areas separated by highlands, mountains, or regions near the ocean coast. The area of \u2018inland\u2019 is much different from coastal areas, and it consists of a much larger area. According to https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/california-central-valley/\n7) California\u2019s central inland valley is considered both the heart of California agriculture and the heart of California industry. The Central Valley is also a place of exceptional natural beauty.\n8) It is a very large and diverse area. In addition, it has a lot of oil deposits such as oil and gas deposits. For example, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_reserve says that there are more than 1.3 billion barrels of oil in California\u2019s Central Valley, and most of them are located in the southern region of the central inland.\n9) In summary, the answer is e) inland. \nSo the final answer  is e)", "answer": " 736"}

Choices: \nA: in a mall B: in a super market C: in a street stall D: in a corner store E: in a shopping centre\nOutput: 1) The question asks about who would one apply for a job as a cashier in Mall.\n2) An individual who has applied for a job as a mall is a \"Mall Cashier\" as he/she will be working in the Malls. Hence, the correct answer is:\nC) In a Mall.\n3) Hence, Option A is incorrect.\n4) There is no reason for the person to be a \"Mall Clerk\" as he/she would simply be employed in a mall and would work as a general clerk. Hence, Option B is also incorrect.\n5) Similarly, Option D is incorrect. Since a Mall Cashier is a person who works in a Mall, the position would be very different and not like Cash Selling in a Stall which is a casual and sporadic job.\n6) Hence, Option E is also incorrect.\nSo the final solution is C) in a Mall\n\nInput: Everyone should be educated.

{"text": "did they first see the ferocious creature? Choices:  the top of the cliff B: at the bottom of the cliff C: right before the cliff D: in the cave E: at the top of the cave\nOutput: 1.'The first' usually implies the most important or significant event, so the main event would be the first one.\n2.'They first saw the ferocious creature' implies that they encountered the ferocious creature for the first time.\n3.'The top of the cliff' and 'the bottom of the cliff' mention different perspectives of one individual.\n4. However, we don't know whose point of view it is, so we can't determine which of these options is correct.\n5. The same logic applies to 'the top of the cave'. \n6. That leaves the options \"right before the cliff\" and \"at the top of the cave\".\n7. 'Right before the cliff' implies that they encountered something nearby/adjacent to the cliff before seeing the creature.\n8. However, 'right before' usually implies proximity, not just nearness in location. This means that the creature could have been just \"near\" the cliff, not right \"before\" it.\n9. This eliminates the previous option.\n10. That leaves \"at the top of\" which doesn't make much sense since \"at the top\" doesn't necessarily mean they saw the creature near the top of the cliffs.\n11. The other option, 'at the top of the clifff\", does make a lot of sense and can be deduced from the sentence provided.\n12. Therefore, the answer \"C: right before the clifff\"\nSo the final answer can be C: right before the cave\n\nInput: It might be a trick question.

The specified location of the snake and its movements can be inferred, which eliminates a few options: hiding inside the tree and hiding beneath the tree are unrealistic because snakes tend to move away from dark, damp spaces at night.\n3..  The snake couldn't have been hidden under the tree.  A snake would rather not be inside a tree.\n4..

It is essential to check for the presence of doctors, hospitals, and pharmacies at a chosen place to confirm that the person has access to medical facilities. 2: The word \"where\" can be interpreted as an in-person or physical location. 3: Therefore it is fair to use both \"hospital\" and \"doctor\" as locations under consideration. 4: A. \"Hospital\" can be defined as a building or the medical facility itself, whereas \"doctor\" can be defined as the medical professional who works in the hospital. 5: Under this interpretation, it can be concluded that in most cases, a person would prefer seeing a doctor at a hospital to a pharmacy. 6: Another interpretation could be a situation where a person can use both \"doctor\" and \"hospital\" interchangeably, leading to either \"hospital\" or \"doctor\" being the correct answer. 7: In such a case, all possible locations of both \"doctor\" as well as \"hospital\" should be considered, such as a pharmacy and a general location like a street or sidewalk, respectively. 8: Therefore, it is fair to conclude that the most probable option from the provided five \"Where does a person with a/an broken arm need to see the doctor?\" is \"B.

Choices: 1. A: The swings 2. B: The slide 3. C: The merry-go-round 4. D: The seesaw 5. E: the sandbox\nOutput: 1.\"Her parents went to the park\" tells us that they are visiting a park, and one of their activities is to ride the playground equipment, as her older brother takes part in the activity that she does not enjoy.\n2. The answers involve park equipment, except slide and Sandbox, which mention two different outdoor activities that do not involve riding. \n3. Given that slide was part of the question's details as her brother took her there, and since slide is not mentioned to have been enjoyed or not, it is assumed that this is an activity she did.\n4. And Sandbox was not mentioned either, but the options do include it, hence, we can consider it to be another activity she took part in.\n5. Now, we can go back to the first sentence, and deduce possible reasons why her parents went to the park. A and B can be ruled out since they are related to activities she did not like.\n6. C, D, and E are ruled out for similar reasons.\n7. The final option that fits best is D: The seesaw, as a seesaw usually involves riding in tandem, so it is unlikely to be enjoyed by the brother, who may take her on a seesaw ride.\n8. Hence, the answer is D: The seesway\nSo the final answer [is d: the seesaw\n\n\n\nInput: Her mother sent a parcel with her daughter's new shoes and a letter. The boy's letter was to [him].

It could be either. If it were wild, it would likely be found in its natural habitat: the woods.\n\n2- Considering that we're not told whether or not the pig is domesticated, none of the remaining options are likely to be the pig's living environment. \n3- Hogs are farm animals - if they're in an environment that contains a farm, then that farm is their home. \n4- Hog heaven refers to heaven itself, not a pig's living situation. \n5- In a trash bag? That indicates illegal activity, or a pig that's fallen on hard times, neither of which make sense for this context. \n6- There are also no details of the pig's age and status. If it's a piglet that needs to be tended to, then a farm would be a logical location. If it's mature, however, a farm may be incompatible with its level of mobility. \n7- In any event, the question only asks where the pig could live. The word \"could\" implies flexibility on behalf of the pig. \n8- With all this taken into consideration, the answer is G: in hog's heaven.\nSo the final correct answer is G: in the woods\n\nInput: Which of these does the word \"sand\" not mean?

It makes no sense. So we remove that combination. \n4) Now, only 'Left + Top' is left. \n5) Since 'Front + Back' was removed we can say the possible combinations left are: Right + Top, Right + Back, Left + Top. \n6) Among all these combinations, only 'Left(Top)' is given. \n7) Therefore, the answer to this question is: Answer is: E: Both Sides.\nSo the final ans: E: Both Sites\n\nInput: If a boy asked his mom,\"Would you like some ice cream?\" How would she answer?

Different herbs have different storage requirements.\nDry herbs like basil and oregano need to be kept dry, in a dark and cool place, like a pantry or an air-tight container, or else, they will lose their flavor and nutritional content. On the other hand, tender herbs, like cilantro, will soon wilt and go bad in the pantry and would be better kept in a small glass jar with a cover, or in the refrigerator to avoid wilting.

{"text": "does it matter that it is hot outside? Choices:  a) in a cold place b) in a warm place c) in a cold water tank d) in the cold water pool e) in a cold swimming pool\nOutput: 1: Looking at the options, the first thing we know is that the weather is hot. This implies that we are in an area that is warm (in this case, outdoors).\n2. We can also deduce that whatever the individual (in this case, we) is doing, it is something that they do not want to be in this warm climate.\n3. From this, we know that it is not in a 'cold water tank' or a 'cold water pool', as these imply hotter temperatures (since the water would be hot if that were the case, which would be a good thing).\n4. We can also deduces that 'in a cold place' is not the answer, since it is not that cold in the context of 'in this warm climate'.\n5. Thus, the answer would be 'in a warm place', as the only option which does not explicitly refer to heat or warmth.\nSo the final question is: \nb) in a warm place\n\nInput: At a restaurant, when the waiter brings you a glass that is too hot to drink, what do you do?

Hot water is usually served at room/ambient temperature, or as such that there are no obtrusive temperature discrepancies between the water and the other contents (such as coffee). So the options C and D are irrelevant for the question. The question can thus be narrowed down to options A-B.\n2) Option A implies saying sorry to the waiter for not being able to drink the drink, whereas option B states that the drink is too hot to drink and orders it to be taken away, which is the answer - option B.\nSo the final part is:\n(B) ask to take off the glass", "answer": " 30"}

Although the person may learn new things when they go to church, school is typically associated with children and young people. \n3: The word \"church\" indicates a religious place of worship. This is an unlikely choice, considering the context of the question.\n4: The word \"the park\" is vague, so it's probably best to rule it out too.\n5: Finally, \"office\" is the most specific of the options. It makes sense from the question's context. \nSo the final answer for the where did the person go section is 5: Office\n\nInput: Why did the person go there? Answer: Because she wanted to go to the store. \nHe thought it was a good idea to do it but later on she thought otherwise because \nwhat? Choices: 2: She wasn't a fan of it 3: she found herself having to do things 4: it was too hard 5: she was not interested in doing it 6: she didn't believe he was the best\n\nOutput: 1) The question begins by stating that a person planned to go to the store and this plan was supported by the other individual.\n2) He was later on convinced to abandon the plan because of his partner's beliefs on the matter.\n3) The remaining choices are'she didn't believe he could do it','she didn't want to do it','she found it hard to do it', and'she was not interested in doing the task.'\nThis last option makes sense because of the previous question's answer which talks about the person who was keen to go to the store, while this one, in the present clause suggests the other person was not interested in this task or activity.\nSo the final choice here is 6: she didn\u2019t believe he was the right person\n\nInput: He's never had a lot of money. \nHe decided to what?

From the statements, we can understand that the child is shivering which has been caused by low temperature in the environment. \n3. Based on the question, we cannot predict when the shivering will stop.\n4. All the options are linked to the metabolism of a child.\n5. However, given that the child is shaking to maintain body temperature, the answer can be found most easily from the parts through which body heat escapes the most.\n6. We also know that the brain uses a higher percentage of the body's calorie burn, which can also be inferred from the 'head/brain' option.\n7. Hence, the given options can be:\n8. E: lungs\n9.

'R':New York is the one that make most sense, as New York is the city, and if the author is New York then he will live in New York.\n3.) 'G':New York implies that the author is an American.\n4.) 'A':New York is ambiguous, as it can be a town or a city, and it could be anywhere in the country.\n5.) 'N':New York implies that New York is the author's native city. This is ambiguous, as the terms 'native city' and 'city' can mean either a town or a city.\n6.)

Choices: A: fire B: fear C: people D: guns E: enemies\nOutput: 1) Since a famous American general called him fear as the only thing we can fear, the answer will be fear, as it is used.\n2) We can conclude that the phrase is not 'The only things we have to fear is, (are) fire, fear, people, guns, and enemies'\n3) The general was talking about fear, and not of people, guns, or enemies as fear is an abstract concept, and not of things. In the absence of evidence that says so, we don't have to make an assumption of which answer is correct.\n4) 'Fire' is an example of an abstract concept, which might be referring to both 'people' and 'fear', and hence, it is not safe to assume which is the correct answer.\n5) To be on the safe side, the word 'fear' can be replaced by the word'scary things' or 'people' for that matter.\n6) Since the answers that provide the word with meaning are 'people' and'scary things', people would be the only thing that can be referred as the only thing we have(fear)", "answer": " 760"}

In a supermarket, this would be in the kitchen aisle or toy section. \n3. Since we have more than one option, the best bet is to go for the option that contains the most relevant information. \n4. In this case, we can find it in either a supermarket toy section (C) or kitchen aisle (A). \n5.

{"text": "would you expect a person to get more nutrients in a vegetarian diet? Choices:  B: in the stomach  D: outside of the body C: the blood A: the cells\nOutput: 1.\"In a vegetarian diet\" means the phrase relates to dietary choices rather than nutrients.\n2. Choices of'stomach', 'blood' and 'cells' are all biological parts of a person rather than an abstract diet.\n3. The term \"more nutrients\" implies the person wants or needs to get more nutrient than they are currently getting.\n4. Since 'outside of the body' is ambiguous and could mean the person has removed nutrients from their body, this doesn't seem likely.\n5. Similarly, the option 'in the blood' refers to the person's circulatory system of veins and arteries, but this doesn't increase the amount of nutrients in someone's body.\n6. This leaves the option 'cells' as the only one that fits the context.  This makes sense because the diet provides nutrients so that the cells in the body can function properly.\n7. Thus, the answer to where a person is likely to get more nutriets in a vegetarian diets is 'cells'.\nSo the final possible answer is C: the cells\n\nInput: Which term best describes a person or people who do hard work?

But I think if I were to solve this by a logic.\n\"He is found with fruits in the tree, so he is surviving with fruits....\"\nAn apple was a fruit, so apple can also be the answer, though we don't have the fruit which has been mentioned in the question.\n\"Corn isn't fruit, so it can be the answer.\"\nI guess we can narrow down from options Corn and apple.\nBut if I were to solve it using a different strategy...\n\"Hobo means man travelling with the bare hands. He is surviving on fruits or food without any extra sources of income. \nApple, banana, corn and orange are fruits but can be consumed as juice....corn can't be.\"\nSo, \"He was once found in a tress with apple juice bottles....\"\nSo Apple can be the answer for the question.\n\n\n\n# Explanation\n\nThe explanation is explained below. All the answers are given for your reference.\n\nInstruction:Answer the following question.\n\n1. We need to find out the missing word.

Choices: 1: Take a bird out 2: Attach feathery material 3: Place nest 4: Make bird sounds 5: Provide bird food\nOutput: 1: Take the bird out: A bird in a birdhouse flies away. So if you remove every last bird and lock the door, it won't fly away. It will starve to death and eventually you don't have to worry what you are going to do with a birdhouse.\n2: Attach feather material. The house was made for birds to reside in, if you make the house feathery enough then it will attract birds. Birds find feathers very interesting. One way to tell birds to come in a house is to attach feathers onto the wall. After that, the birds will start to make their nests of feathers and eventually come inside your birdhouse. This is a great way of attracting birds without a bird.\n3: Place nest. Even though you cannot make a nests for birds in birdhouses, you can place feathers that have been separated from a bird in the nests. Birds have a high curiosity for feathers, so all they will focus on is getting to the feathers, and once they see the feathers they find it very interesting and they will definitely nest there.\n4: Make bird sounds. Many birds in houses have made sounds attractive for birds to come fly towards them. Birds that don't fly normally can fly only when they hear attractive music and songs. It can attract many birds.\n5: Provide bird feeders. Bird houses attract birds. When there is food on the bottom, it can attract different kinds of birds to fly around the house, and once they see food, they will fly in the house.\nSo the final option is E: provide bird food\n\nInput: Why did the cat go into space?

The word 'comprise' can be used in a variety of contexts, but the question provides us with an additional clue in the form of \"a group of people.\". \n2. 'Comprise' can refer to a group of people, as in \"a committee\" or \"a team\".\n3. 'Comprise' is derived from the Latin word 'compos,' which means \"to take something into oneself.\" \n4. For example, a person can comprise two or more parts or members. \n5. Looking at the options provided, we can safely rule out options A and B. \"Place\" is not a group of people but a single location.\n6. 'Person' refers to an individual or solitary person. \"Group of people\" doesn't make much sense.\n7. Thus, we can rule out options B, C, and E. \n8. Option D refers to a collection of things. \"Person\" and \"group of things\" are not synonymous terms. \n9. 'Person who works for a business' can be a person but it is not a group of persons.\n10.

Consider the options in the context: 2a : A: The answer isn't possible because \"king\" is not used in the context of the story. 3a : B: \"His wife\" is used to represent the maiden he loves. 4a : C: \"Honor\" is too generic to answer the specific question but could be a possible outcome of the love the character received from the maiden. 5a : D: \"His King\" is correct based on the context. 6a : E: \"The kingdom\" is incorrect based on the context \nSo the final answer will be : He didn't believe in himself but he later became King as he received the love and respects from the maiden.\n\nInput: The answer is 8 times the sum of one and eight so the next term will be what?

{"text": "must you keep your bats when they're resting through winter? Choices:  Sleep: A: In trees B: In a cave C: In batsquatters. D: In attics of old buildings\nOutput: 1) The key to solving this question is to analyze the options, understand what bats are & how do they sleep.\n2. Bats are mammals that belong to the order Chiroptera. They are nocturnal and live in colonies. \n3. They find shelter in dark spaces like hollow trees, caves, or abandoned buildings during the day.\n4. When resting through winter, bats typically hibernate or sleep with their bodies tucked in a fetal position and their heads facing downwards.\n5. A bat \"sleep quarters\" is a room or space where bats can rest during the day. It's often a dark, warm place with easy access to food. \n6. So the correct option based on the description provided is - 'in a cave' as bats sleep in caves during their migration season.\nSo the final option to choose is B: In caves\n\nInput: The pig's face was clean. She was very happy. The pig was what? Choices: happier than a dog A: as a dog B: as a goat C: as a cat D: as a duck E: as a donkey\nOutput: 1.) The pig's expression suggests she's happy about her appearance because it suggests she's well taken care of. Pigs that are well taken care of are likely to be cleaner than most since they tend to be messier than other domestic animals (such as cats or dogs). \n2. Pigs are generally seen as not very clean animals, like sheep or goats. Pigs make a mess at mealtimes but are very clean and take care of themselves when they're not. \n3. As we can observe, an animal's character is often reflected in its appearance.\n4. Therefore, in order to answer this question, we can assume that: \n5. a.) Pigs are more clean than other farm animals. \n6. b.) Pigs are happy when they look clean, and in this case, the pig was smiling because she was well taken care of.\n7. c.)", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "can you find an invisibility cloak? Choices:  ( A ) hagrids home Dumbledore's office ( B ) Hufflepuff's common room ( C) Ravenclaw tower ( D ) Gryffindor's common room  ( E ) hogwarts\nOutput: 1. In an invisibility cloak, someone or something that is invisible would appear visible when wearing the cloak. \n2. In Harry Potter, there are 4 houses in Hogwarts and each house has their common room. \n3. Hagrid and Dumbledore's offices are part of a university and would not be considered the same as the common rooms of students. \n4. So one cannot find an invisibility cloaked in any of the office or houses of Hogwarts. \n5. Instead, they would need to be in the common rooms in the houses. The common rooms are the only places they are found. \n6. So an invisibility cloak can be found in the common rooms of Ravenclaw and Gryffindor.\n7. Hogwarts has 7 floors, and the common rooms can be found only on the 3rd and 4th floors. \n8. Thus, we see that the options can be classified as follows - Harry Potter house, and Hogwarts floor. \n9. Among the given options, the place where a cloak has gotten lost is Ravenclaw Tower, and the cloak is at - Hagrid's home and Dumbledore'sg office. \n10.

It could be a cloudy day, with the wind blowing a little strongly.\n3. In such a situation, it makes sense to put up an umbrella, wrap up a little tighter and dress warmer.\n4. \"Put your coat on\" does not refer to dressing up when it's cold.\n5. \"Look nice\" does not necessarily have anything to do with dressing up.\n6. But we are more or less aware if the weather is cold or not.\n7.

We know that \"the church\" is the oldest building in the old testament but it might not be the oldest building in the world. So, \"the church\" cannot be the correct option. \nChoices: \"The Library\" as the oldest building is incorrect. The reason is the library. It is not the oldest building in history but it is the oldest library in the world which is in Alexandria,Egypt. But the town in which we have been referred to does not represent Alexandria,Egypt (in the passage). So, this building cannot be the oldest. \nChoices \"the high school\" as the oldest building in not correct also. The earliest school in the world was founded at Nineveh,Assyria. The evidence also shows that the Ancient Iraqis had schools for children in Babylon and Ur. But the problem is \"the town\" in which we have been refenced. It is not an ancient town. It could be contemporary. In such case, how can we say that \"the high school\" is the oldest building .\nChoices:  \"The train station\" as the oldest building could be correct.

This excludes the three specific options - local shop, music store, pawn shop.\n3) The remaining options - 'Pawnbroker' (D) and 'Store' (E) - are both generic enough to encompass a pawn shop as a special case.

However, only B (noise polluiton) impacts the building itself. If the restaurant is to be built in a location with a high number of noise emissions, it may encounter difficulties in attracting customers, due to people's preference for quiet places. Thus, of the given possibilities, C (noise pollution), which is closest to affecting the building, is most likely to be the reason for the problem stated in the question.\n4) The other choices are less likely to be relevant in this scenario.\nSo the final answers is C: noise pollution\n\nInput: What makes it hard to get work done is when you get distracted?

{"text": "do the most skilled players play sports?  In what type of facility? Choices: 1. A: public B: field 2. A: indoor 3. A: stadium 4. A: outdoor 5. A: pool\nOutput: 1) 1. When answering where do the most skilled play, we tend to think of where they play the most which would be a field at home.\n2. The options include public, indoor, stadium, outdoor and pool.\n3. The option field  suggests a field at home or a school field. In either case, it doesn't offer us a specific location. An outdoor stadium or outdoor field is the location with the most skilled athletes, such as a US Open tennis tournament with Roger Federer or the US Open golf tournament with Woods, so we can eliminate choices 1,2\n\n4. Next, let's consider the options for indoors. When you think about playing indoor sports, it is often hard in a public space. A gym that is used many times throughout the week will be much better than a hotel fitness room on the 26th floor. The best athletes don't usually play in public facilities like a hotel gym or pool.\n\n4) The last question that we need to consider is the pool facility. A public swimming pool has rules and restrictions which might even cause some of the best swimmers to go elsewhere because there are restrictions such as the age that you need to be to use it.\n\n4) Public, stadium, field, outdoor, and indoor facilities are good for the less skilled people who want to improve. The less skilled will prefer these facilities. An outdoor stadiums is open to all and you have to go out to watch, so it may become too crowded for the less practiced players who may be timid around the more skillful athletes. Therefore, we prefer the outdoor stadium.\n\nThus the correct answer is\n\nOutdoor Stadium\n\nHope you found this helpful, I'll let you know if any other questions or doubts related to this blog.

Choices: A: be a pest B: become prey C: have food D: be seen E: be safe\nOutput: 1) Let's brainstorm a few things: the scientist is in a lab and a cat is in the room. From this, only two possibilities are left:  1) The scientist sees the cat 2) Scientist doesn't see the cat.  2) We can remove the first one through process of elimination.  3) Now, let's see if the two remaining possibilities make sense:  1) The cat is a pest 2) The cat is seen.  4) Both these seem pretty good possibilities.  5) The first one, the cat is a pest would mean that, the scientist needs to find a new way to deal with/ get rid of the cat.  6) Otherwise, the scientist would have known about the cat. Similarly, with the second one, we can say, that it is almost certain that the cat would be seen by it's mother or the scientist, unless, the cat was hiding somewhere that the scientist missed.  7) This would be the main reason for the scientist not to notice the cat.  \n8) To conclude, the correct answer should be : The cat could have been seen. \n9) Since: It could be a pest, it would have to be seen.\nSo the final conclusion is", "answer": " 62"}

So the options narrowed down is A) and E)\n7) In order to answer this question, we need to analyse the words and their meanings. Option A) implies that annual pay increases to lumber mill employees take place 'usually' in their payroll.  \n8) Option E) talks about pay at the start of the year taking place 'usually' at the start of the same year, every year. It does not tell us if this annual pay increase occurs at other times during the year or in subsequent years.\n9) So we can eliminate the option E) because the time and contexts of the pay increments were not provided. \n10) Concentrating on the context of the question, it becomes clear that option A) holds more value.

Choices:  a) the digestive system b) the heart c) the lungs d) the central nervous system e) the liver\nOutput: 1.'Where are most of the human's body's energy and needed nutrients for daily living?' Questions are usually answered with single answers (no, some, etc) unless they contain an indefinite quantity, such as all, most, or every. \n2.'Most of the energy/nutrients...'. Given the question, we can infer that'most' is the single needed quantity to be answered. \n3.'most of the human body' is a complete phrase which contains all the parts.\n4.'Most of the human body' has just one article in its sentence. That article is'most' (The, a, an are articles or words that indicate that the noun immediately follows is a singular or plural noun or the main idea of the sentence.)\n5. Most of the human body is not a plural phrase, as seen through the singular article.\n6. Most of the human brain, for example, would've been written,'most of the brain' (which is plural).\n7. Now, 3 articles make the phrase most of a plural phrase (most of the strawberries, most of the people, etc). 7. But 1 article can not make'most of the human body', a plural phrase.\n8. Hence,'most', as a word used correctly here, is the single needed quantity, and as seen through its 'a' or 'an' article, it's just an article.\n9. Therefore, 'Most of the human' has just a single word'most' in it, which can not be a plural word. And the same goes for 'Most of the body', as they both contain articles that define them as single words that cannot be plural.\n10. This indicates that the answer to the question should be the single word'most' or'most of the human' and not the plural phrase'most of the human'. \n11. But as seen,'most of the human', used in the question, is not a plural word either. \n12. This means the question is asking", "answer": " 9"}

A black tie affair would also be appropriate in either case, and is the most likely answer.\n6. Therefore the answer is A: Black tie affair.\nSo the final anwer is A: Black tie affair\n\nInput:", "answer": " 60"}

This is a question to find the most probable answer.\n2- Now let us consider each option one by one -\n3- B - Answer: Not possible- not in the bathroom.\n4- C - Answer: not in the fridge, that would mean putting them in a cold place.\n5- D - Answer: not in your car, else it would invite dust or bugs.\n6- E - Answer: In your bag, it's the most probable place as it's always in your hand during your outing.\nSo the final  answer is E: in your bag.\n\nInput: I can see all this, but I cannot feel one thing. What could it be? Choices:  C: smell D: temperature E: pressure\nOutput: 1 - We can assume that we are in a room and that the writer can feel heat and cold but not taste, see or smell.\n2- What we are not sure about is the nature of the lack of sensation - whether it is because the writer cannot sense or whether there is a sense (not in use).\n3- Starting with D \u2013 Taste is one of the five known senses and is directly connected to the sense of smell, which in certain conditions, can be a secondary sense.\n4- So, Taste in most human beings is considered as the only sense not to be lost. With this in mind, the other four answers must be disposed of one by one. \n5- E \u2013 The only answer left for consideration is Pressure.\n6- This sense is closely linked to the sense of touch through pressure receptors that reside in our nerves. We experience heat, cold or pain through the sense of touch. \n7- The sense of pain (and pressure) cannot be distinguished from the other four remaining senses: Taste, See, Heat, Smell respectively.\n8- Hence, a logical answer to complete the question is E: Pressure.\nSo the final question is E: Pressures\n\nInput: Where did the", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "did the great-grandparents of the great-grandmother go on their trip?

(B) We can say that the option'moved' is a verb-noun combination or compound noun, which means that the word'moved' forms a part of the person's title, rather than forming'moved' in the sense of an action or verb.\n3. (A-B) We can therefore dismiss options A and B, as they aren't relevant to the actual question.\n4. (C) The only grammatically correct solution from the options is Option D, which has 'travelled'.

Choices:  *: in its spines *: in holes around its roots 2: in its spines 3: in holes around its root 4:in its spines 5: in holes around its routes\nOutput: 1: The question suggests that a cactus is unable to collect/ obtain rain water in the desert where there is no rainfall for many days. \n2: Cactus as an organism stores water in specialized regions - they are referred to as Xerophytes. \n3: These regions for absorption and storage of water are usually underneath the plant (but can be above too). \n4: Xerophytes may possess 'holes' around the roots while also having spines as modified leaves as well; these spines serve multiple roles, including water retention. \n5: The structure of Xerophytes is well suited to absorb and retain large amounts of water, which is critical for survival under desert conditions. \n6: The cactus might retain water in these spines under low moisture conditions. \nSo the final answer choice is 2 - in its spines\n\nInput: Which is more expensive: buying all of your books, or getting them only from the library?

To find a single frog in the wild, the obvious locations are in a rainforest, a swamp, a river, or a pond.\n3. If the frog is in a rainforest or a swamp, then it is likely to be found among the vegetation and trees of those habitats.\n4.

Choices:  Call a family member B: hire a babysitter C: stay home alone D: leave a note E: call a neighbor\nOutput: 1 The question asks about a situation where an individual wants to go to the beach but cannot find a babysitted.\n2. It is possible to find a babysit but the question asks about finding a way around.\n3. The first option is to call someone with which the person is related, like a mother, father, grandparent, brother, or sister.\n4. This option eliminates the possibility of finding a babysitter via the second and third options (hiring and leaving a note).\n5. Leaving a note or calling someone at home would increase the difficulty of finding a babysisitter because the individual would have to go to their house and ask for the babysits help, it would increase the waiting time and it would increase the cost since there is more than one adult in the house, that is, the babysitter would have to take time out of his schedule so that his or her children or spouse can take care of their children.\n6.

Jupiter and Saturn orbit beyond even the Moon, so these two planets don't experience the same orbital cycles as the Earth or Mars. \n8: This makes these two planets more difficult to track changes in comets.\n9: The Earth and Moon are the only objects in the solar system that are constantly illuminated by the Sun's light. \n10: This makes it easier for people on Earth to spot a comet. \n11: Jupiter and Saturn are also objects that can be seen without a telescope. \n12: Although they orbit in different time zones than the Earth, their large size and proximity to the Sun allow them to be frequently viewed without special equipment.\n13: Mars and Venus don't have the same attributes as Jupiter and Saturn for the same reason, so spotting changes in comets from these two planets is more challenging.\n14: The moon also has limited changes, and there are no comets orbiting the moon, so this is not a recommended option. \n15: Therefore, the answer is Option E - Moon\nSo the final answer A: Jupiter\n\nInput: I can't think of this solution myself, but I know someone who probably can.

Nine months later, Mallory's body was found 300 meters from the top of the mountain by a reconnaissance expedition. No sign of Irvine was found, and as Mallory carried no oxygen, it is considered extremely unlikely that Irvine would have survived to the summit. \n5.

But while interest may be higher than with a regular savings account, that interest is often locked in for the life of the account. \n5- This means you won\u2019t see the benefit of that interest until the life of the CD ends. Plus, you won\u2019t be able to withdraw any of that interest until the term of the CD ends. \n6- And although the interest rate may be high, there are still fees that can be charged on high-interest accounts that you don\u2019t find on other accounts. \n7- So if this is your goal, then high-interest accounts are your best bet.\n8- Option C : You should think about options to inflation. Investments in stocks and bonds tend to pay higher rates of return because of inflation. As a general rule, we want the rate of return (the gain on our investment) to be higher than the inflation rate (the increase in the price of goods and services).\n9- If you\u2019re able to achieve a return greater than the inflation rate, then you\u2019re in a better position to preserve your purchasing power (and even build wealth).\n10- This is the reason why you should use options other than Compounding effect, and the only option is D: inflation.\nSo the final option is D: infltaion \n\nInput: What type of exercise does a runner do to strengthen his bones?

However 'near' implies that she hid the book in a nearby place, such as a shelf or table, whereas 'among' means hiding it among many similar books.\n4. 'Between' refers to a pair of objects or a grouping of items, which could mean hidden together. \n5. We can rule out 'among' and 'near' as they specify where she hid the book and not how she hid the book.\n6.

Choices:  D: Because it is not a human  B: It is incapable of flight  A: It is too small to fly  E: There is no gravity  C: It has an instinct to fly  D: It does not desire to fly  A: It is physically unable\nOutput: 1: The question asks about birds' inability to fly upside down. \n2. There are two possible reasons for this: the bird is too small or it has an instinct to avoid flying upside down.\n3. However, the option that specifies only flying 'upside down' as opposed to falling/landing at the side that is not pointed at, seems to be the more likely. \n4. 'Upside down' may not just refer to landing as opposed to falling - it may include flying straight backwards to avoid landing.\n5. Since 'upside down' covers a wider set of options, we must discount that the bird is too small.\n6. Additionally, birds may not always fall forward due to gravity but instead sideways, making 'gravity' a less likely cause.\n7. It also wouldn't explain why, if such a bird fell down, it would land flat sideways.\n8. We can thus discard A and E.\n9. Option C states that it has an 'instinct to fly'. This may apply to any orientation,  including the bird's instinct to avoid flying upsides down.\n10. Therefore, birds probably have an instinct to avoid 'upside down' flying, possibly due to the danger of falling, as they may not be able to flap their", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": "do you typically see an example of a prehistoric animal? Choices: 1. A: a fossil site B: bones C: dinosaur zoo D: bone museum E: animal show\nOutput: 1) In order to find out the answer to the above question, we need to have an understanding of the prehistoric animal meaning. 2) For the prehistoric animal context, the prehistoric context refers to the time before written records that extends millions of years back in time. An animal fossil is a fossilized remnant of an animal's body like bone or teeth or hair. 3) An animal bone museum is a place that focuses on the study of animal fossils. 4) A prehistoric animal zoo is a place that focus animals that live and behave similarly compared to prehistoric animals, like a bones museum. 5) An animal show refers to a show or display that includes a variety of animals. 6) We are also given other options that are bone museum, bones, bones museum, and bones but, to identify the main purpose or goal of the museum that is the most probable thing, we need to analyze the entire thing in detail. \tThe prehistoric zoo also includes the goal with the most similar words that is the bones museum. So then, to understand the context and find out the answer to \"where do you typically see an animal fossil?\", we need to narrow the answer from bone museum and bones. And since bones museum and bones have been narrowed into bones, we need to find out to which of the context of \"where do you typically find bones?\". The answer should be bones museum, although the question has been put as \"where do you typically seeing animal fossils?\", we can't rule out the bones. So then, the answer would be bones, or bones museum. 7) Another approach is to find the main topic of the statement. Animal fossils and an animal skeleton are more related than the other elements in the question: zoo, animal show, and bone museum. In addition, the text mentions that we know about dinosaurs, which are prehistoric animals. So the answer is B: a fossil site as animal fossils are more focused than the other elements in that particular question. \nSo the final answer to \"where do", "answer": " 46"}

{"text": "did the ancient Romans get their building materials? Choices:  B: Italy C: Greece D: Egypt E: Europe\nOutput: 1, The question is talking about Italy and not Egypt.  It doesn't mention Egypt.\n2. Now Italy was part of the Roman empire at that time; and the Romans didn't even know there were places like Italy, Europe or Greece. \n3. The only place they knew was their little country in the hills near the Tiber river.  But that was only Rome.\n4. So it doesn't make sense that they would use the stone that was available back then in Italy which was marble or alabaster.\n5. The Romans built with brick - which is a building material made up of clay. Clay exists in Italy and there is no other place like Italy available. \n6. Therefore, brick is the best logical choice for building materials.\n7. The options that are available in Europe like marble and alabaster are not viable for Italy. \n8.

Taiwan can have only one.\n4) The given options 'China', 'japan' cannot have mid-range and low-range models because these countries are well known for producing the best quality of bicycle. China might have only high-range models(the best quality) and that would be inefficient because there would be no more use for the low or mid-range models.\n5) Japan would not have low-range models because Japan is known for designing and making aesthetically pleasing and unique bicycles rather than high-quality standardized bicycles.\n6) Based on the information, 'Taiwan' can be the best option.\n7) We can conclude that 'Taiwan' is the best in terms of Quality.\nSo the final correct answer is E: taiwan\n\nInput: Why is cereal corn used to make whiskeys?

Choices:  a) The frontal b) The frontal lobes in the brain which is underneath the forehead. c) When a bullet is directly targeting the frontal lobe. d) When a bullet is targeting the back of the head, killing the vertebrae and spinal cord. e) The bottom of the brain.\nOutput: 1.\"Pig snuff of the Mushroom\" means the part of the mushroom that emits a poisonous gas.\n2. It has the capability to decapitate a victim by being blown on. It is also capable of killing many other birds and animals due to its poisonous components.\n3. When snuffing in front, it is considered as frontal.\n4. Decapitation is the act of separating the head of the corpse from its body. The word 'decapitation' is derived from the verb 'decapitare', which is derived from the Latin word, 'de caput', which means \"of the head\".\n5. The frontal lobes are part of the brain that sits immediately in front of the eye's view of the nose.\n6. They are considered the first part of the brain because they are the first part to be developed.\n7. Pig snuff is very strong and powerful and can quickly take away the life of a person, with the frontal lobe being the easiest to penetrate.\n8. Pig snuff can kill people instantly when it hits the target and when the frontal lobe of the brain is its target of attack.\n9. When the pig snuff gets into the skin of a person's forehead, neck, back, and face, it enters through the nose and mouth and kills his brain cells responsible for various functions of the body, including breathing and heartbeat. These brain cells are the ones that kill the person, and they can be found in the frontal lobes of the brain.\n10.

{"text": "are you most likely to notice the term \"subway\"? Choices:  A:(in) a tunnel B: underground C: the street D: inside a home E: in a station\nOutput: 1.) The word \"subway\" has the connotation of going underground or underground transportation in an area. Thus, it's most likely to be located underground/in a tunnel.\n2.) The other options are not likely locations for'subway,' thus the answer doesn't include options with non-subways or locations not related to transit.\n3.) Subway could be found underground because it's a train that operates in a tunnel. Alternatively, the word \"subway\" also typically refers to a train or tube operating in a specific geological space.\n4.) A subway is an underground public transportation system, and \"subway\" is used to describe it.\n5.)

Choices: \tA: \tAfter comma, put period, then capitalize B: \tAlphabet C: \tNumber D: \tComma E: \tTwo words, no more\nOutput:  When adding two words to a question - one at the end and one at the beginning of the statement  - you need to put commas after each word, including the question word and the first one you add.  This practice may seem more confusing than it is once you know the rules. \n1. The rule is simply to separate multiple words and add a comma after each word 2. 'Put comma between' only refers to words. It doesn't mean a word 3. So, the answer is E.  The sentence is: 'Where do you put a comma between two words?'. The phrase refers to two words: 'put a comma between'. There is a comma after 'put', and then the question word 'where' followed by two more parts of speech: 'do you', 'put a comma between', and 'two words'.\n4. Since we know that the phrase refers to two words, there are two parts of speech to be separated. \nWe don't need to use commas after the first two words, 'place the comma between'.\n5. The 'two words' part is the one we want to separate as follows: 'where you' and 'place the comma between' 6. Therefore the sentence should read: 'where do you put a comma after you' 7. 'Where do you put' is the correct answer.", "answer": " 60"}

Only options A, B, C, and D remain. \n5. Option A: 'In a tent' is an activity. The people either do the activity of staying in a tent, or they don't.\n6. Since the narration describes the people as waiting, they don't do the activity of stay-ing in the tent.\n7. That eliminates 'in a tent'.\n8. Option B: 'At an ice-cream-shop' can either be used in a context of where the people went or where they bought an ice-cream. \n9. The narration does not specify either of these.\n10. Option C: 'To sleep' is a passive activity. The people are sleeping, or they aren't. \n11 Since the narration describes them as waiting, it can be concluded that they are not asleep. \n12.

'At' means that in which place we are given location information about somebody/something, like what time it is when we are at a location. \n      \n    2.

However, the ocean's location is unknown; as it is surrounded by mountains as well as land, which reduces the chances of us being able to directly see its surface; the mountain will most likely have the greatest amount of water. \n3- The sky is defined as the point in the atmosphere that is above the clouds and extends out into space, which has no water in it.\n4- The tree has water but it is limited by the quantity of the amount of water in one particular tree. It could exist in a large amount or small amount, depending on the size of the tree.\n5- The mountain is known to have the largest amount of water as it is the biggest part of the world, and water covers 75% of its surface. \n6- Since the majority of the world is water, the probability will be greater for us to be able to see more water in the mountains, compared to the oceans and the sky.\n7- We conclude that the answer to the question, where does the most water exist is given by the options C.

{"text": "in America are you most likely to find a toll booth? Choices:  New York City A: Bermuda C: New York D: Virginia E: Hawaii\nOutput: 1) New York City is one of the most populous regions in America so there's a high chance of finding a toll booth. Also, New York City's infrastructural quality is very high which makes it convenient to travel to different parts. This is another reason why there's a high possibility to encounter a toll booth in NYC. 2) Hawaii is the southernmost state in the US and has no bridges connecting it to any other part of the US except Alaska. 3) In the US, there's a high frequency of accidents involving cars and trucks, and accidents cause damage to people and their vehicles. The US government understands this and wants to charge a sum of money from the people to maintain and develop the state's infrastructure and prevent further accidents. Therefore, many toll booths are built across the US to regulate and control the flow of people and their cars on highways.\n4) Bermuda is a group of islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. There are no toll booths on these islands.\n5) Cities like New York and Virginia are located in the US and have some of the most advanced infrastructures so you are more likely to encounter some toll booths in these cities in the US.\n6) New York City is the only city in the US that has no bridges connecting its roads.

A beekeeper is someone who keeps bees for the production of honey and other products.\n3. Alaska, California, Colorado, and Florida are in the U.S.A. and known for agriculture such as grape plantations etc.\n4. If we take into account these factors, the most likely places where we can expect to see a lot beekeepers would be: California (grapes), Colorado (wheat), Florida (citrus) or Alaska (honey).\n5. Therefore, we can eliminate options A and E and focus on the other two remaining options.\n6. When comparing California and Colorado, we can eliminate Colorado because of the presence of 'wheat' and keep the focus solely on California, which has the presence of more than one agricultural product like grapes and cotton.\n7. Similarly, when assessing options B and C, given the presence of 'honey' in option C, we can eliminate option B as Florida is the only place where a significant number of beekeepers can be expected.\n8.

The choice is between a dog being bathed in any of these months. And there is no option for other months. Thus, we can assume that other months have no relevance to the question asked.\n4.

What is another way to say \"know their audience\"? Choices:  A. \"Know the audience\" B. \"Understand the audience\" C. \"Know their needs\" D. \"Recognize their presence\" E. \"Knows their location\"\nOutput: 1.'Know' is the verb used in the original sentence. From the given options, 'know' is the only one that could logically replace the verb and not change the intended meaning of the sentence. B. Understand can be used but it means the same as know(the audience).\n2. Similarly, C. Know their needs can be used instead of 'Know the audience'. But, it would change the intention of the sentence.\n3. 'Recognize their presence' and 'know their location' are not the logical choices since they seem impractical in the given context. \n4. Hence, the answer is A. 'Know the audience' and the context of the question demands 'Know the audience', the other options seem illogical.\nSo the final word to use is: 'Know the audience.'\n\nInput: It has been found that the 55th minute of the 3rd episode of 'Riverdale' is the most likely time for a character to die.

{"text": "did William Wordsworth live? Choices:  a: london b: scotland c: england d: scotland e: wales\nOutput: 1) William Wordsworth was an English poet of the late 18th and early 19th century, known for his love of natural beauty and his romantic lyrical poems.\n2) One of the most famous works of the poet is the autobiographical poem \"My Heart Leaps Up When I Behold\" which he wrote in 1807. \n3. \"My Heart Leapt Up\" is a poem by William Wordsworth, and it was most likely written in 1802, not 1807 as stated in the question.\n4. The poem is a reflection on the beauty of nature, and the title suggests that the poet's delight is felt when he encounters something that stirs his feelings.\n5. In the introduction to the poem, the poet expresses his appreciation for the beauty in nature, and then uses the metaphor of a rising sun to illustrate his vivid feelings and sensations.\n6. The poem has a rhythmic quality, with each line divided into three parts, and it is expressed in the form of a question, as if the poet is trying to imagine himself living in a world where nature is untouched by human hands.\n7. Although the poem was written early in the poet's career, the imagery and themes are characteristic of his later, more mature work.\n8. In conclusion, the poem \"My Heart Leaped Up When I Behold It\" is a reflection of Wordsworth's passion for the natural world.\n9. It was probably written in 1830, when Wordsworth was more established as a poet. \n10. Also, the poem may have been written in London or Scotland, since it was written a year after Wordsworth moved from London to Dove Cottage in England before moving to the Lake District in 1778.\n11. After analyzing the poem and the biographical information about the poet, it is most likely that Wordsworth wrote the poem while he was living in London or Scotland.\n\nInput: You may prefer your hair to be blonde,  but you're going to need to wash it regularly to keep it", "answer": " 23"}

Hence it will not help the shrub grow quickly, nor is there anything that prevents it from growing quickly.\n5) Out of all the directions, south has the warmest temperature. This could be a detriment to plant growth. Hence out of the options South has been removed.\n6) East and West both are possibilities that could hamper the growth of shrub, for East, the sunrise and sunset might hamper the plants growth and West has the possibility of wind speed hampering the shrubs growth both having been excluded.\n7) So that leaves us with 2 options - East and West - which both have the possibility of hampering shrub growth hence either does not prove to be the most suitable. This then leaves us with possibility of growing the shrub in the direction of East, which has been marked as the correct option, option 3\nSo the final answer for input is E: east", "answer": " 370"}

{"text": "do you get ideas for new paintings?  A: A new painting B: A magazine C: Art books D: My imagination E: The store\nOutput: 1) A painter is asked where he gets ideas for new paintings. The options are: A new painting, a magazine, art books, my imagination and the store.\n2) A new painting is an already painted canvas or image. This is the obvious first choice of ideas for new paintings, since it was the origin of the artwork.\n3) Hence, this implies that the artist is looking for sources of newness.\n4) The next obvious choice is 'a magazine'. Magazines could have aesthetically pleasing and new images which the painter can use as inspiration.\n5) However, this is very similar to a magazine.\n6) The next option is 'art books'. Art books are like magazines but contain a larger number of images, possibly of works by other painters or artists.\n7) A painter can get new painting inspiration from many pages in the book, such as through a colorful or unique piece. However, it is also something the painter already has, since it is a physical object.\n8) Next, we have'my imagination', which is another personal and concrete thing the painter already has, that cannot provide newness.\n9) Finally, there is an option for getting new ideas from 'the store', but that implies an external source which could also be a finite amount or resource.\n10) Considering A new painting, art books, magazine, my imagination and the Store, the answer option for ideas for new paintings is either A new painting or art books.\n11) Since A new painting is an obvious choice of ideas for new arts, the best choice of ideas for new painting is an art book.\nSo the final answers is D: My imagination\n\n## Next time: 24, 25, 26\n\nThanks a lot for attending this class.

{"text": "would you place a thermometer in a room that needs to be hot? Choices:  top shelf B: back bottom C: bottom top D: front middle E: right side\nOutput: 1The question is about where to place a thermometer in order to make a room hotter\n2. The thermometer should be placed anywhere that will allow it to register a hotter temperature in the room.\n3. Therefore, the thermometer should be placed in any of these locations where heat can escape - on the top shelf, on the bottom shelf, or in front of the room in the middle. \n4. However, the best location for a thermometer that will help raise the temperature of a room would be on the top shelf.\n5. Placing a thermometer on the top shelf will help to quickly bring down the temperature from below because it is near the upper limit where heat is constantly escaping.\n6. Placing it anywhere other than on the top shelf would not be as effective as it would take longer to lower the temperature. \n7. Hence, the answer to this question would be \"C: on the top shelf\".\nSo the final answer for the question will be C: top shelf.\n\nInput: For which of the following words is the accent on the first letter? Choices:  E: dime  B: pine  C: cactus  A: puma  D: jaguar\nOutput: 1It is to be understood that an accent is a distinctive feature of a language that is used to mark stress or distinguish different words.\n2. In the context of English, accents primarily occur on a spoken basis. \n3. Accents typically involve the pronunciation and intonation of the language, not its spelling.\n4. In this case, the term \"accent\" refers to the stress or pronunciation of the pronoun.\n5. So, for each of the words, there is an emphasised letter: \"dime\" has an emphasis on the third letter, \"cactus\" has an emphasis of the fourth letter, and so on. \n6. The terms given as choices are all words in English that have the accent on the 1st letter.\n7. Therefore the answer could be E: dime, followed by B: pine, C: cact", "answer": " 7"}

Freshwater mussels live in freshwater bodies like rivers, lakes, or ponds, and not in aquariums. \n3. Thus, we can reject the options - 'aquarium', 'pond', 'river', and 'lake'.\n4. Freshwater mussel habitat varies from species to species, and there is no single area where freshwater mussels are found. \n5. We can eliminate the option - 'none of the above'.\n6.

These are on opposite sides of Europe, so Europeans wouldn't be living there.\n4) Similarly, the India region is one of the largest regions, so its not possible that people from these two regions would be living within a specific country. Hence, let's take S.E Europe and N. Europe and analyze what each one has to say.\n5) The two possible places are S.EEurope and N. Europe. \n6) Now look at the details provided by options in these two regions. \n7) The first option given is N. Europe. In this region, we could have an Aryan living in a country like Germany as Aryans are known to have Indian lineage. So this option could have an Aryans. \n8) The next region is S.E Europe. It could have a Jew living between countries like Greece or countries of the Balkans as Jews were prevalent in that region. \n9) Therefore, the best answer to the passage is S.E Europe, as it could have an Aryain or Jew living within the region, since we have details backing up the option.\nSo the final and answer is S.E Europe", "answer": " 200"}

The most appropriate option from this list of options would be to play board games inside the library\n2: The only two options which are relevant to this question are A: in the library and B: at friend's house as D: in a basment, E: in the loby of a hotel are completely irrelevant in this context as we are talking about playing the board game.\nE: in the lobbys of a hotel is a completely irrelevant context given the problem-solution. The second important point is that playing board games at a friend's place has been specified as a suitable alternative for playing board games in a library. Hence, one should eliminate C: at a friend\"s house as the correct answer.\n3: When a student wants to play board games, we understand that he has taken all necessary measures to play the board games. So it is obvious that there is more than one option available for him to play at least a board game. So it is essential to examine the options which he has taken and determine the most logical option out of them.\n4: So here it is obvious that most of the options available to this particular student would be either at a friend's or playing at a library as he is looking for another person to play with and or looking for a space to play so he cannot play it at a friend's without having a friend at his place.\n5: When analysing the options for playing board games, the only two options, which are relevant to the problem-solution is A: in the library at friend's house - so we conclude that A in the library is the most logical sequence of options.\n6: The sequence for playing the board game will be either in the library or at friend's house.

Choices:  *A: In someone else's home or business *B: In a shoe box in your own home *C: Between pieces of glass in a bank *D: In a bank in the bank*E: In a bank in your own home\nOutput: 1) The situation involves keeping a safe (precious) thing in a safe place to ensure it does not fall into improper hands.\n2) Among all the options, only option 'B' and 'E' can be ruled out since these would mean keeping the coins in someone else's home.\n3) Given that the question focuses on a safe place to hold coins, it makes sense to exclude option B. \n4) The remaining four options (C, D, A, and E) are possible options. However, among these options, only option E makes sense.\n4) Option E holds within itself the key to the solution - a 'bank', which is a safe place. \n5) The coins will be completely safe, even when not in your own possession.\n6) This implies that the correct answer is option E.\nSo the final answers are E: In a bank in their own home\n\n\nInput: They were arguing about who was hungry.

{"text": "are we going on our trip? Choices:  the mountains A: the mountains B: the hills C: the mountains D: the hills D: the hills\nOutput: 1) The question says, Where are we going on this trip?\n2) \"go\" is a verb that denotes movement or action.\n3) \"we are\" is a subject-verb pair.\n4) In a question like this, the phrase \"we are going\" denotes a future-oriented action.\n5) Since people usually \"go\" to places, we can assume that we are going to a place.\n6) But to what do we go? \"Hills\" and \"Mountains\" are both things that you \"go\" to.\n7) We have to look at context. We have to decide by looking at everything around - a hill is a small mountain, and so are the mountains.\n8) The mountains don't refer to a range of hills, so choosing a mountain is reasonable. \n9) The term \"mountains\" does not include hills or other smaller mountains, so we eliminate hills and mountains B: the hills. \n10) The word, \"mountains\" implies a large mountain range. The smaller mountains are then known as \"hills.\"\n11) We only mentioned the mountains, so we know the mountains are the option we need to choose. \n12) Choosing mountains as the correct answer is correct because mountains are the only option that has the letter \"the\" associated with it. \"the\" indicates that it is a specific mountain range, not a general term. \n13) So the final answer is A : The Mountains.\nSo the final Answer is A the mountains: the mountains.\n\nInput: In a world without animals, a herd of animals could easily get lost,  but if someone's what?

The option that makes sense for frogs to be sitting somewhere is on the windowsill.\n4. Frogs can't sit on the floor or the countertop because they don't have the proper anatomical structure to sit down.\n5. Frogs only naturally sit on the windowsill. \n6.

{"text": "are you most likely to find a coworker babysitting?

We'll focus on where someone other than the parent would go to receive childcare.\n3. The possible places include carpool, bathroom, coffee machine, babysitter, and \"baby shower\".\n4. A babysitter is only present if the recipient hired them.  A person who is the babysitter of their own kids wouldn't be hired but would presumably be at home.\n5. Likewise, a baby shower is a celebration for the arrival of a newborn to the parents, which would be in the home.\n6. Therefore we need to eliminate A: carpool, B: bathroom, and E: baby shower as these options do not involve hired help or are related to the newborn.\n7. D: coffee machine is an option in which a babysitter might stop to grab a break, as they tend to serve food and drinks.\n8. That leaves us with C: babysitter.\n9.

The brain is made of distinct areas responsible for different tasks: the cerebrum, cortex, thalamus, and hippocampus.\n3. The only two regions of the brain associated with learning, memorization, and computation are the cortex and the hippocampus, so rule those out (A).\n4. The thalamus is more associated with sensing and responding, while the memory is a long-term storage and processing facility. So, eliminate these options too. (D and E).\n5.

To fully turn on the water supply from the pipes, we would turn the pipes by 180 degrees back, which would cause the pipes to create a pressure that could open up the stopcock. \n45. The pipes also start from the stopcock and would lead to the water supply pipe so if the pipes were the first thing in the system it would mean that the stopcock is also one part of the system.\n55.

E.F.G.H.J.K.L.M.\nOutput: 1) Let\u2019s take a look at each answer choices:\nA- Grocery store: it seems like it is an option because it contains the words \u201cpear and paddy fields\u201d. Paddy fields are where we usually find pears growing. You could also assume this is an option because it seems to be the only thing that doesn\u2019t include the phrase \u201cfresh\u201d. Since we know farmer\u2019s markets contain pears, it would be a reasonable guess that they are generally \u201cfresh\u201d because they are from local vendors. On the flip side, grocery stores are not known for having \u201cfresh\u201d produce because they\u2019re not really sourcing it from local vendors.\nB- Local farmer\u2019s market: farmer\u2019s marktes are always a great suggestion if you\u2019re trying to find something. However, this answer is the most un-specific because it includes the phrase \u201cas per your taste\u201d. What if you actually want the biggest pear you can possibly find? It might not be \u201cas per your taste\u201d if that is the most important factor that matters.\nC- Paddy field: the only information we have to go on is that it contains either the words \u201cfresh\u201d or \u201clocal\u201d and that is usually an indicator that it is a market where you can get local produce. It would be the best suggestion because it isn\u2019t as specific as \u201cas per your taste\u201d, but is more specific than a farmer\u2019s market.\nD- Fresh produce store: it fits our criteria for being a market where you can buy \u201cfresh\u201d produce. It definitely also seems specific enough and probably offers a wider variety than paddy fields. However, it is a bit too specific. It also contains the word \u201cexclusive\u201d which could imply you can\u2019t just show up and buy any sort of produce. This could mean they may have some sort of pear that suits your taste, but maybe not this big pear that you are asking about.\nE- Store: we must assume this answer was added on because it seems to fit with the", "answer": " 400"}

The company landed smaller types of planes.\n2  However, the key is not that the company used smaller planes but to improve the capacity by allowing bigger planes. \n3  The correct answer is: B: any type of planes.\nThe company's improved airport design would have made it possible for any type of plane to be landed even if those planes were larger. \nSo the final answer would be, B: any type of plaes\n\n## Question18:\nThe story of a king and his three sons\nThe king had three sons.

Moreover, teams have one leader, the best option suggests that the data goes to the leader.\n2. `The given statement mentions \"the most valuable data,\" so a common practice across many successful organizations is to centralize this data in one location (e.g. within the leadership team) and have the leader decide who needs access to the data versus who doesn't.\n3. `If the data is stored as 'to the best...' the wrong people could access it, e.g.: 'Susan, who is not working on the project, decides to access the most valuable data.'\n4. `Centralizing 'to the right group of people' also makes sense: 'Tom and Sue, who are members of Susan's team, access the data.'\n5. `Lastly, if storing 'to the bottom of a p..', then 'everyone on the project team can access the data.

Choices: 1. to the sea 2. to the sea again 3. to the shoreline 4. along the coastline 5. to stay together 6. to go to a restaurant 7. to an island 8. to a pond 9. together with the tides.\nOutput: 1-6. The statement about the seagulls is referring to a collective action or behavior.\n7. An island is not a body of water, which is inconsistent with the first five statements.\n8. As an interruption or outlier, we can eliminate this option to simplify the problem.\n9. If the seagulls were to stay together, they would likely stay in a flock and move together.\n10. The choice \"to go to a restaurant\" or \"to an island\" doesn't seem reasonable. \n11. The remaining choices are referring to land travel, which is unlikely for seagulls to do en masse.\n12. This leaves us with the options of \"to the sea\", \"to the shoreline\", and \"along the coastline\".\n13. Since these options are variations of \"to the sea\" (e.g., \"the sea again\" instead of \"the sea\"), only one of them is correct. \n14. Therefore, the answer must be among the options of \"to stay together\", \"to go to a pond\", and \"together with the tides\".\n\nInput: The man was in a state of what? Choices A: shock B: panic C: surprise D: calm E: disbelief\nOutput: 1.We are starting with the first response that looks correct.

This is because he is in shock, so nothing is coming to him.\n5.The man's state is that he is in disbelief. Hence, The Answer is E: disbelief.\nSo the final Answer: E: disbelief", "answer": " 70"}
{"text": "will you find a robin? Choices: 1. A: in a garden 2. B: in some bushes 3. C: outside a building 4. D: in a shed 5. E: around houses\nOutput: 1) We can rule out option 'D': in a shed, because the question is not talking about a shed but a 'robin' (a small bird), and sheds generally don't appear in gardens.\n2) It makes sense to put the option 'A\": 'in a garden' (because of its connection to a 'garden' and a 'robin').\n3) The other three options aren't related in any way to 'robin,' so we don't have to think about them, especially since the question wants just a single answer.\n4. So, the correct answer is 'A' (in a garden).\n\nInput: Where do you find moss? Choices: 2. A: in a forest 2: B: in a garden 3: C: in some bushes\nOutput: 1: We can rule out option B: 'in a garden' because the question is not asking about a garden but a'moss.'\n2: We can rule out options A & C: 'in a forest' & 'in some bushes' because both of them are not connected with'moss.'\n3: The only option that makes sense is 'Moss can be found C: in some bush'.\nSo, hence the answer is 'B' (in some bushes).\n\nInput: What could a shark smell?

The options in the question start with the numerals '1' and '2' and end in their tens, which could lead us to conclude that the final option is a single four.\n4.

From these statements, we can conclude that it's impossible for 'A' to be correct, as it's impossible for both 'B' and 'A' to be true. \n4. Similarly, it's impossible for statement B to be correct. \n5. Therefore, all that's left in this case is for us to narrow down to choice D. \n6.

{"text": "should you put a plastic cup that is leaking? Choices:  X: on the stove Y: on the heater Z: on the furnace A: on the sink B: on the top of the fridge S: on the dishwasher M: on the window sill\nOutput: 1. The question asks us where we should put a plastic cup to stop it from leaking.\n2. The word 'leaking' implies fluid or liquid, which is a good indication that the liquid is moving in some direction, likely toward the bottom of the container.\n3. Therefore, we can infer that the container needs to be upright and open so that the liquid cannot flow downward.\n4. In particular, for a plastic cup, we would probably want to set it on its top, as this keeps the liquid inside and prevents it from spilling.\n5. There are many ways that different liquids can be poured from a container.\n6. In this case, the liquid is probably something that can be poured all at once, as leaking implies an ongoing flow rather than a dribble.\n7. This leaves us with the options of A: on the sink, B: on the top on top of the fridge, M: on the window and S: on the disheswsher as they make sense for pouring a full container of fluids.\n8. However, 'on the sink' is likely not a viable option, as a plastic cup is not appropriate to contain water or other liquids in the sink.\n9. Likewise, 'on the top of the frigde' doesn't make sense. The fridge has a closed door which wouldn't be ideal for liquid to be sitting in an upright position.\n10. We can therefore eliminate these two options.\n11. 'On the dishwashr' isn't a plausible choice. \n12. It implies placing the plastic cup with liquid directly on the stove, which would likely cause the liquid to bubble over and spill.\n13. Thus, the answer must be either 'on the sink' or 'on top of the fridge'.\n14. Therefore, the answer must be: B: on the top, top of the fridge.\nSo the final answe is B: on", "answer": " 96"}

Among these requirements, Reading is given the highest priority, however, this is not the only reason you become a Librarian.

{"text": "does a bunny look for food? If it's not  in a _____ of flour, what is it doing? Choices:  ABCDE - bunny\nOutput: 1) Start by determining the meaning of question - We know that the bunny is looking for food at some place. Since the food is in some form of flour, the bunny must be a flour. And we are supposed to find out what it is doing, so there must be something that the bunny does other than simply eating and sleeping.\n2) List down the options - We have the 5 options (ABCDE) to find the right answer (B - looks in a flour; then we are supposed to find that what the bunny does apart from looking and sleeping)\n3) We know that the bunnies live in a flour - C (flour), hence we can eliminate that option. So now we are left with 3 options (ABC)\n4) What are the bunnies doing in a flour - A or B or C (Ans: C)\n5) C fits the correct context, hence we go with C\n6) Apart from looking (hunt), they sleep (sleep).

A roommate signs in on either of these two areas - a room or an apartment's living area, depending on the size of their apartment and the person's preferences and/or comfort level. \n2. If an apartment has a room or two, then the roommate would typically sign in on that room, at the door frame. This is a simple, standard scenario and applies to both apartment choices.\n3. If an apartment is large, has more than two rooms, and no common area/living area, the roommate doesn't need to sign anywhere because they will probably just walk into the large apartment. This is a non-common scenario and can only occur in one of the two apartment options.\n4. For Option 1, Roommate chooses between his own room (Apartment) and apartment living area (Room). \n5. If the room is small, the room is the roommate's personal space, so they would sign in at the room door frame.\n6. If the room is big, the room is a shared space, so they would often sign in at the apartment living area. \n7. For Option 4, Roommate choides between Apartment (Room) and Roommate (Apartment). \n8. It's unlikely that the room they'd choose for the Roommate option would be a large room. \n9. However, it's also unlikely that it would be a common space like the living area. This is because there would probably be fewer rooms in this scenario, so common areas would be less likely in this case. \n10. The second common option for the Roommate situation is the room would be small. This is due to the odds of getting a room in the Apartment option being smaller.\n11.

Inside-out and on towel both refer to towels being put on racks or hangers. \n2) So the towel isn't drying, it's being hung on a rack to dry. \n3) Now with this information in mind, the answer to the question must be on towel or inside, as that's where a towel's most likely to be after it's been taken off a dryer.\n4) Hence the answer is either E: inside or C: on towel.\n5) Of the options available, 'inside' is the best-fitting choice, as it is the most logical place for a towel dryer after it's finished drying (inside an oven). It also makes sense that the towel would have been hung on a rack, i.e. towel rack or hanger, inside the oven to dry because otherwise the hotter air inside the oven would have melted the plastic, making towel dryers much more expensive. \nSo the final answer to this question is C: on towel\n\nInput:  What is likely to be left on a kitchen cabinet if a person leaves a spoon there?

{"text": "would you find the highest rate of suicide? Choices: . A: a deserted beach at night B: a church C: on a cliff D: a hotel room E: a busy highway\nOutput: 1.\"Suicide\" is generally associated with feelings of hopelessness and depression, so the rate of suicide would be higher after dark compared to during the day. \n2. Although churches can be places where people seek help or solace from their troubles, they are unlikely to be associated with the high rates of suicide.\n3. Similarly, cliffs are not an area with a high risk of suicide, and a hotel room could be used for various purposes, including for suicide, but it is unlikely to have the highest suicide rates.\n4. A busy highway is not the most likely site for suicide because the high traffic and noise would make it a less appropriate place, and the high risk of injury or traffic accidents would discourage this.\n5. This leaves us with A: deserted beach at night and B: a cliff.\n6. A deserted beach at night offers solitude and the chance to reflect on problems without distractions from daily life.\n7. It may also be associated with feelings of loneliness and hopelessness, which could lead to suicide in some people.\n8. Cliffs are often associated with a romantic image of jumping off the edge into the ocean below.\n9. The feeling of being at the edge of the cliff and the romantic image of jumpings into the water below could be associated with a sense of freedom and joy, which has been linked with suicidal behavior in some individuals.\n10.

He did it, but only because he wanted what? Choices: (a) more money (b) a free lunch (c) a handshake (d) to leave (e) a raise\nOutput: The passage states multiple aspects about this situation.  We are informed that the lights were on previously, so we know they turned off the lights.  This implies that the lights weren't off when they left.\n1. Given the specific words in the question that they asked him to turn off before he left, the phrase because he wanted'more money' or 'free lunch' makes sense.\n2. Since he did it, they probably would have paid either'more' or 'for the food', so a free lunch is a more likely option, and 'a handshake' is less likely based on how the phrase 'to leave' works here.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that the person's act was motivated by the idea of seeking more money for himself rather than simply leaving.\n4. Options (a), (b), and (e) are not viable since the person turned the lights off and didn't receive any additional payment in return for doing so.\n5. Option (d) is also not viable since leaving is not a motive, and option (c) does not specify an incentive or motivation.\n6.

The question does not state the age of anyone. \"Where did you grow up?\" implies the time span of \"up to current moment\".

{"text": "does a flare glow outward?

'Flat' - straight up and not'straight ahead' because upward movement can be both flat or direct as the term directly up and straight does not mean flat or horizontal.\n3.'Sideways' - movement up and not 'across' because sideways movement can be up and across, which could be in a direction slightly to one side of 90\u00b0, so they both can be fuses, not the grenade burning fuse.\n4.'To the side' - can either be left or right, or to the front or back, so can't be either as it's up and down and the grenade can only be sideways to a point, then starts to travel towards you.\n5. 'Upward' - as it can also be straight up and down, a little left or right because of the friction from the air and ground, so can be either if up or down.\n6.

We need to find the reason why he wasn't performing that task himself and ask him a question about it.\n3.) 'Ashamed' here is an antonym of the word 'knowing better'.\n4.) It means he wanted to hide his lack of knowledge or skill and not request help.\n5.)

So the most likely places where one would least like to find a corksrew is an office and a gambling hall. \n2: This scenario involves preparing a dinner party. So the most likely place where one would least like is a party. \n3: This scenario involves buying groceries. So the most likely option where one would least like a corkscreww is a grocery shop. It would be highly illogical to not have one there and buy it from somewhere else.\n4: This scenario involves buiying liquor. So the most likely choice where one would least like corksrew is a liquor store.\n5: This scenario involves buuing groceries. So it is most likely that one would have a corkscrewr when buying groceries, thereby negating the question.\n6: Finally, this scenario involves having a party.

Only 'place with many opportunities' is a possibility to answer the question with 'A good selection of hikes'.\n4: A location with a lot of visitors won't be a good destination for hiking.  Additionally, such a location would also have a lack of'remote regions' which have a better selection of hiking than well-developed areas.\n6: 'Long hike', as a destination, is again disqualified from the question. \n7: Thus, the answer to the best selection of hikes is 'A place with many opportunities'. \nSo the final answer, when using this method, is B: A place with a lot of opportunities\n\nInput: Where should an elderly person get a colonoscopy?

A: football stadium - A football stadium is always filled with people, especially on a Sunday in the city where the sun is shining all night. \n5. The crowd is always bigger in a stadium when the football match is taking place, and it could turn out to be a busy place if the weather condition is not conducive.\n6. A shopping mall- A shopping mall is a place where people go for shopping on a Sunday or any other day. However, people like to go to a shopping mall during the weekends, when the shopping mall has a bigger crowd. \n7. It is also a place where one can find restaurants. \n8. A public park or a beach - If the weather's nice outside, everyone would like to spend their time at a beautiful beach or in a park. We can definitely find people under age 30 at these places at noon on any Sunday.\n9. By a boat - In summer the coasts of Barcelona are flooded with boats. If on a Sunday, one goes by the river from 6 am to 8 pm, one definitely might spot some people under age 39.\n10.

Let's look at what each of the given options mean and the reasons why they might be correct.\n5. A hoof without boots?  It does not make sense to say a hoof without boots.  A hoof is a part of an animal.  It is not normally removed or taken off. \n6. A horse without boots  It could mean that a horse has no boots.  But a more accurate way to say it is probably a horse without shoes.  Shoes (or boots) protect horse hooves from wear or injury. So without shoes, a horse's feet would be more likely to be damaged. \n7. A horse without shoes  This refers to a horse that does not have boots (or shoes). \n8. A horse without food  Again, this is not the meaning of the term un-shod hoof.\n9. So, from the given 5 options, the answer is C. \n10. A horse without booteS It does not make sense.\n11.

Choices A: capitalization B: competition C: governmental restrictions D: innovations E: transportation\nOutput: The first step in solving the problem(s) is identifying what it is. That is what we need to do here.\nThe problem of a cottage industry is that the cottage industries cannot compete with the large factories. The problem in the factory era is that the factory owners do not want to compete with the cottage industuries.\nBased on these, the capitalization would be A and competition would be E.\n\nThe Cottage industry problem has nothing to do with transportation or governmental restrictions.\n\nAnd the competiotion in the factory era of industry does not involve competition itself, but the competitiveness between the large factories and the small cottage industry.\n\nIn other words, the problem with cottage industries does not arise because of competition between factory owners. So the choice of competitors is not D which is 'factory owners are competitors.'\nD cannot be the choice in relation to the cottage industrie problem\n\nAnd the government has nothing to do with competition.

In such scenario, one solution is to park the vehicle behind the curb - which implies that the car has to be moved further to the side so other drivers and passersby don't get in the way.\n3. Contrary to this - 'on the street' simply means on the street. 4. 'In a garage' could not be a very common choice because most homes cannot accommodate extra parking space, especially in urban areas. \n5. 'on the sidewalk' is also a bit of a problematic choice, as one cannot park on the sidewalk since it is meant for pedestrians.\n6. So 'In a garage', 'on the sidewalk', and 'on the street' are out of the question.\n7. Also, according to the given options, 'in a garage' is a feasible choice.

Choices:  D: over the tropics E: over the arctic\nOutput: 1.\u201cTropics\u201d refers to the area near the Equator and is not the preferred location for prolonged rainfall. The Arctic is not the preferred location either.\n2. The Earth rotates around the Sun in an anti-clockwise direction.\n3. This means that the Northern Hemisphere\u2019s winter begins in the Arctic and continues towards the tropics.\n4. During this phase, the sun moves away from the Arctic and towards the tropics. \n5. The reason that the sun shines most in equatorial regions is that water particles at low latitudes have less ice in them. \n6. The water particles in high latitudes remain frozen for most of the year. \n7. In high latitudes, even when the sun is low in the sky in the winter season, the water particles are completely frozen and do not reflect the sunlight.\n8. This makes low latitudes the preferred location for prolonging rainfall.\n9. Moreover, due to its proximity with the equator, equatorial regions experience hotter temperatures, even during winter.\n10. This warmth is enough to evaporate more water from the land and oceans for prolonged rainfalls.\n11. This is why equatorial regions of the globe receive prolonged rain for a long duration. \n12.

{"text": "does a pine cone tree get its pinecones? Choices:  - A: another tree - B: the sky C: a man D: the branches E: a bird\nOutput: 1: The answer we are looking for in this question can be inferred by the structure of the sentence: \"Where does a pine cone get its pine cones from?\". \n2. To find the answer, we can think of 5 possible entities that can be the source of pinecones. These entities can be ordered according to their likelihood of being the source of pine cones.\n3. The entities are - another tree, the sky, a man, a branch, and a bird.\n\n\n\n\n4. An unlikely source is another tree because there could be many other trees from which pine cones can come. A man is not likely either because humans typically do not fall from the sky and cannot come from branches. \n5. The sky is also unlikely as pine cones cannot come from the sky.\n\n6. The most likely source, based on the evidence given in the sentence, is a tree branch. \n7. Pine cones grow on trees, and the tree itself is an entity that can generate pine cones. \n8. Therefore, based on the evidence provided, option D - a tree branch is the most likely source of pine con es.\n9. It is important to note that the word \"those\" in the question is plural and suggests multiple pine cones coming from one tree branch. \n10. We can deduce that they all came from the same source, and thus, the branch can be taken to be a larger branch. \n11: Therefore, the source of pinecose is a larger part of the tree not a single branch.\n12: Option D is incorrect and should be ruled out.\n13: We have now narrowed down the choices to option C - a man and option E - a bird. \n14. Birds are able to fly and can come from different heights, implying they can come from the sky. \n15. Option C: a man, however, isn't capable of descending from the sky and thus cannot be the source of pime cones. \n16: Option E - a bird, is therefore the correct answer.", "answer": " 600"}

Their fists of what?  This is a difficult problem, because the two brothers were very violent,  and they had what kind of weapons?  Choices: A: bare knuckles B: bats C: knives D: guns E: bows\nOutput:A.The passage of text gives us a description of a problem - two brothers are fighting, one with knives and the other with guns.\n1. The word \"fought\" seems to be a past tense word, meaning they have already fought.\n2. One might ask why didn't they use other weapons like bare knuckles, bats, knives, or bows.\nThis implies that there was some sort of weapons in use during the fight.\n3. The two brothers being violent implies that they are not afraid to fight to the death.\n4. It is also mentioned that they had fought before, and fought badly, and we can assume the fist blow was the most painful.\n\nIn response to these clues, we can make the following conclusions:\n\nThe brothers fought\n\nThey fought again with  weapons\n\n\n5. The fighting was a battle to the death, since one brother was using knives and the other was using guns.\n\n\nThis means that each brother was armed. The question asks of a weapon, and the answer is guns.\n6. The question is looking for the kind of weapons. One brother would be armed with guns and the other with knives.\n\n7.

Considering the provided digits 1234, a hypothetical combination of possible 3-digit numbers includes 123, 1234 and 12344.\n5. We can eliminate options 1,2,4,and 5, all of which have no relevance, given the digit combination mentioned.\n6. Therefore the hypothetical remaining options would be 123 and 1233.\n7. We can exclude 1233 using the digit combination.\n8. Thus, only option 123 is relevant.\n9. This is because the digit 3 indicates that the phone number has 3 digits and the second digit is 3.\n10. A person is likely to have a 123-digit phone number in 2 scenarios; if they use an ATM or mobile phone in a particular bank where 123 is the bank code or if it is a TV channel 123 in which he appears.\n11.

A job has many career opportunities.  This company has excellent job opportunities.  This option gives you opportunities in the workforce.\nOutput: The question provides an option that may be an unconventional location for job hunting but has many great opportunities. \n2. To figure out whether this opportunity is a good fit, we will analyze the characteristics of the options and narrow them down until the best fit is remaining. 3. Let's analyze the company options that don't have \"career opportunities\" and see if they are a good fit.\n4. Company doesn't have a career doesn't have many career opportunities because it doesn't offer any opportunities.\n5. If it were only to have a small number of opportunities or none, that would still not be a good fit, so we can exclude an option that has a smaller number of career opportunities.\n6. Company offers few career opportunites could work if there are only a small set of career opportunities compared to a larger set.\n7. We can therefore exclude the options that don't offer career opportunities or offer few career opportunities.\n8. As for the job options, we can eliminate an option that doesn't mention career opportunities and has few opportunities.\n9. The remaining options could indicate having some career opportunities or having many career opportunities.\n10. Company that has great opportunities describes an option with many career opportunities, and option with excellent opportunities also indicates a fit because it has many opportunities.\n11. Company offers many career opportunites could be a good fit depending on how it is used.\n12. However, options with many opportunities seem to fit the most because they directly address job opportunities, and because they were still there compared to all the other options when only the company options were eliminated. \n13. Compared to other alternatives, this particular option may have career opportunities.\nSo the final decision is that the option that the best option is Company offers many career opportunities\n\nInput: The problem of making more time is a familiar one.

Wal-Mart pharmacies may provide vaccines for different kinds of illnesses or vaccine-preventable diseases. However, there is no mention of a \"flu shot\" specifically, so it can't be directly inferred that Wal-Mart has access or offers the vaccine. \n2: The flu shot is an influenza vaccine administered every year before flu season to help prevent infection. CVS is a chain of pharmacies that offers a variety of medical services, including vaccinations for flu and shingles. This option is a reasonable choice for getting a flu shot.\n3: A \"pharmacy\", in general, refers to a place that dispenses medications. It's not limited to a specific chain of healthcare providers like Publix. While Publix supermarkets do offer flu shots, it's not clear from the context if this is a valid choice for getting a flu vaccine.\n4: Similarly, a drug store is a broad term that can encompass a variety of establishments that offer vaccines, like Wal-Mart pharmaceuticals and CVS.\n5: Finally, there is no specific mention of where the \"flu shot\" is located, making all the other options viable options.\n6.

Choices:  F: Fat and piglike B: On a pig C: On an elephant's trunk D: In a glass jar E: Above a bicycle\nOutput: 1, Gumdrops on a Pig is a children's book from the United States. \n2. From the different animal types mentioned in the options, it is clear that 'pig' is a common term for -'swine'.\n3. The phrase 'gumdrops on a swine' makes more sense than 'gumdrops in a jar'. \n4. Hence, the first and the last options, - 'pig' & 'Above a bicycle' are eliminated.\n5. The phrase 'growing on fat' is not a direct connection to animals. \n6. 'Fat and piglike' cannot be applied to someone or something that is growing on fat, since the latter refers to the appearance and behavior of a swine. \n7.

In an interview, he had to choose one of ten candidates, but he chose a ninth.\n2. We are given that the person had to choose one of the ten candidates for an interview. This means that the interviewee had to choose someone (the candidate) from a group of ten candidates.\n3. He chose a ninth. What this option suggests is that if they had to choose two of the ten candidates, he would've chosen the ninth one. Since ten is one more than nine, he chose nine, not eleven.\n4. Now, what does that mean to us, and why does that make sense? To make an analogy, let's say we are putting a team of ten people together for a project. If we were to choose two people at a time, we would pick people from this pool; and one would be the ninth person.\n5. He chose a nineth means if the applicant can choose more than one person on her first choice, she would choose the ninth.\n6.

The core, between the ribcage and abdomen\nOutput: 1.` The question is where the most heat energy in a person's body resides.\n2. A person's body temperature is highest where the extremities are warmest.\n3. To regulate body temperature, the hypothalamus signals the autonomic nervous system to activate thermoregulatory mechanisms, and one of the ways they do this is by reducing blood supply to the extremities. \n4. As a result, heat in the cold extremities is dissipated, but the skin and blood vessels at the core of the body retain heat. \n5. Thus, the most heat energy in their body will reside in the core, between the rib cage and abdomen.\nSo the final answers are 5: The Core, between the ribcages and abdomen\n\nInput: Dustin is very excited to show off his computer, which is in desperate need of a new keyboard.

The question asks about where did the first human cave paintings emerge. \n2. It is likely that, if a group of people wanted to start cave paintings, they would choose a place with ampler access to resources, such as food and shelter.\n3. However some places have better histories than others. \n4. For context, Egypt, Syria, and Britain have longer histories than France and Spain, with many artifacts left behind from before the rise of modern civilization.\n5. Therefore Egypt, Syria, France and Spain are considered as ancient civilizations, and of them Egypt, Syria are also referred as Ancient Egypt and Ancient Syria respectively.\n6. These are the oldest civilizations known to humanity, and they used advanced tools for many thousands of years before they reached the level we know today.\n7. Because, people in ancient civilizations were more creative at their time, we can say that 'civilizations where they live' is where the first human cave painting(s) emerge. \n8. However 'France' or 'Spain' can't be the answer because 'Britain' and 'Syria' are older than them.\n9. Apart from all the above, consider the age difference between 'Egypt' and 'France' as compared to the age difference between 'Syria' and 'France'.\n10.

{"text": "has the most likely place to find a black cape? Choices:  L: hallway M: bedroom N: kitchen O: closet P: basement R: window S: stairs T: back of door U: doorway\nOutput: 1.` A black cape could be found in any number of places. The key point is where it is most likely to be located. After going through all the options, we can see that most of them make sense when we think about the type of a person who would wear a black cape. For example, a dark hallway, a dark bedroom, the kitchen (if they are a chef), the closet and the back of the door. Even the basement, T (a back door), S (the stairs) and U (the door) make sense, if we assume that the person who wears the black cape is a member of a secret society like a mafia. The options that don't do well are: L, P, and R.\n2. Let's analyse them first:\n3. L doesn't really make too much sense as a black cape will never be hanging on the hallway wall. The same with T, and U. It makes sense that if the black cape is hanging behind the door then they will not need to carry it around with them every time they go out or come back. As for P - maybe this person is a superhero and they hide in their basement when they are not out fighting evil, but we can dismiss this option as being less likely than the others.\n4. M makes little sense since cape-wearing doesn't describe the majority of people in the bedroom and it isn't clear what type of a person will wear the black cape in a bedroom - unless they are a very famous and important person wearing all their important clothes when they are in the bedroom, which we feel unlikely. It is not a secret lair or headquarters like HQ, and they are not a member of a superhero group living in the bedroom HQ.\n5. N is also not a highly likely answer, since the kitchen is not exactly a highly likely place for a black cape to be either. So we can dismiss N from further consideration.\n6. The same goes for U, S, P and R.\n7. So we are left with just", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "would you find a water wheel? Choices:  C: river A: pond B: ocean D: lake E: lake\nOutput: 1: Let\u2019s start by considering the different categories from which the answer options can be selected. There is one option from the category of Rivers. So, eliminate B, C & E.\n2. There are two options that belong to the category of the oceans. One of those options talks about seas. So, it can be eliminated.\n3. Similarly, there are three options that belong to the ocean category. So, out of those three, only one of the options could relate to \u2018Water Wheel\u2019. Since option D does not mention anything about the \u201cWater Wheel\u201d, and D is a generic term, \n4. We can conclude that the answer would be found from the category of \u2018Ponds\u2019.\n5. \u2018Lake\u2019 is a combination of words \u2013 \u2018Largest Pond\u2019. So, lakes also contain water wheels. So, the answer can be Ponds or Lakes.\nSo the final  answer is either D: lake or E:lake\n\nInput: He is a highly-strung,  He has what? Choices: A: anger issues, B: a big ego, C: low self-confidence, D: low self-esteem, E: high self-confidence\nOutput: 1) Let's start by understanding the term he is a highly-strined. It means he keeps getting agitated by little things, or that he is easily annoyed by things that aren't worth becoming agitated by. \n2) Now, analyze each option individually:\n3) We can eliminate A and B, as they are not related to the situation mentioned above. Similarly, we can eliminate D and E as they are very specific terms and don't really add much to this situation.\n4) This leaves us with only option C which means having low self-confidence.\n5) So the answer is C, option D. \nSo the final answer  is C: low self- confidence.\n\nInput: If you had $10 million, what is the closest 10-digit number you could spend it on?

Each option makes sense as a location to find a chandleer.\n3. However E: Bedroom & F: Kitchen make less sense because these are not likely to have a chandleer in this scenario.\n4. Furthermore, people would not likely find M: Living Room or L: Hotel Room because both rooms are likely to have their own chandelers.\n5. Among the remaining options B: Bathroom makes the most sense as a place where a chandelier might be found. This is because bathrooms - unlike bedrooms and kitchens - would not have chandeliers installed as part of standard furniture. \n6. Thus the answer is B: Bathroom.\nSo the final solution is B: bathroom\n\nInput: He came from France, and went to the country that we do not like.  He was not supposed to go there! Where did he go?

Out of all of these places, the first option A puts the object in a convenient location to access. \n7. The second option B places it under the pillow, but this could present problems. For example, if someone falls asleep with their glasses on their face then they won't be able to tell when it's no longer in place. \n8. C places the object on a top shelf but there are still risks that it could fall. 9. D places the item under the bed, away from both hands and eyesight, making it less convenient when needed. \n10. Lastly, E takes up a considerable amount of space on a table which might not be useful if there are other items needed near the glasses. \n11, Therefore, option A is the best option as it gives glasses a place close by to easily access.\nSo the final option is A: On a surface near reading material\n\nInput: What to do if you don\u2019t like someone.

Clearly, none of these places has any links at all to 'cactus', and hence, clearly cactus cannot grow in 'rainforest' or 'ocean'.\n5. As ponds have water, it's not natural for cactus to grow there.\n6: This leaves us with only one possible answer: desert. \n7: So, the answer is A. \nSo the final answer to where cactus grow is A: desert\n\nInput: He ran outside and found that his bike had been stolen. The thief got away. How did the thief know to take the bike?

First, we know that the object to be kept safe is not of great value and so it needs to be kept where it needs to be kept. \n2) That means the vault cannot be the storage. That is because it will be not easy for the person to access the vault. \n3) Therefore, it must be the storage (storage is said to be a cupboard) which will be the location for storage. \n4) Since this is the question for a personal thing, therefore this will be the location where the person will keep these items. \n5) We would keep the things easily accessible to us and we would never forget about the location. \n6) A secret safe box will not be considered as the location for safe keeping the item.

Thus, we can rule out options (E), (D), (C) as these answer options are not able to identify a specific noise as of now. This can also be observed by looking at their definitions under the dictionary which shows that person, horse and dog are not able to point out a specific noise. Therefore, we can rule that only (B) and (F) are valid answer options. \n2- Now, look at (B) and (E). Now, horse can respond to a voice command (we know that he listens and responds to voice command). He can react to a voice and respond by any way that the owner wants the horse to do.

Choices:  a. move the bucket b. carry huge weights c. move heavy objects d. carry objects sideways e. carry loose loads\nOutput: 1) Let's start by eliminating the obvious wrong answers:\na)  Cranes cannot carry huge weights, they carry heavy objects.\nb)  Cranes move heavy objects sideways, not sideways.\nc)  Cranes can't carry heavy loads loose.\n2) Now let's take a closer look at the two remaining options:\nd) Carry objects sideways (Front loaders can turn 360 degrees on their axis, so if they need to carry something sideways, they can use rotation instead of a front loader). But cranes cannot move heavy items sideways. They have to use special equipment and techniques. So, this isn't a feature they share.\ne) Carry loose loads: This is an advantage that cranes definitely have over front loaders. But it doesn't seem like a particularly useful one - it doesn't really make the front loader inferior.\n3) Therefore, the answer is: Crane can carry objects sideways only if they have rotation.\n4) So, the answer is : D: Cranes can carry objects sideways, but front loaders can't\n\nInput: The ____ family, in other words, has the ____ genotype and the ______ phenotype.

We can assume that the answer has something to do with money. \n3. Next, we identify the 'thou'. \n4. According to the passage, there are '100 dollar' bills. \n5. The key word we're looking for is '100'. \n6. After the word 'one', we have the 'thou' - 'hundred' in math. \n7. The word 'thou' is usually a symbol for money or wealth. \n8. We use this information to determine that '100 dollor bills' is the correct phrase to determine the symbolic amount of money that each of the answers represents. \n9. Let's analyze the remaining answers to identify the one that can relate to 'thousand''million', 'billion', and 'trillion'. \n10. Option (C) presents 'billion' dollars, which would be equivalent to 10 billion dollars. \n11 While'million' indicates 1,000,000, 'billion' is 10 times larger than million. So 10 million would be 10x10x10=1000 (10 billion). \n12. Hence, 'billion dollars' would relate to '100 dollors'. \n13. Option (F) presents 'trillion'. According to the passage, the 100 Dollar bills came from '3.43 million'. \n14. As we have calculated, 100 dollars=1000 bills=1000000 bills x 3.43 million bills= 3.43 (million). \n15. Thus, '3.43 trillions Dollars' would make sense grammatically as the answer. \n16. So the correct answer to this question is (F) Trillion-Dollars.\nSo the final choice is 2.

And we park it inside the car garage only when we want to park it for long time. We park our car inside our house. The garage is the outside parking place where we park the car for the time being.

B: It's a beautiful day for the baseball game, too.  A: It's a lovely day for the ball games.  D: It is a lovely day for baseball games.  E: It's a great day for baseball games, too.\nOutput: Let' let understand the Question first.  \"It's a beautiful day\" is a noun phrase which is modified with the adjective 'beautiful'.  'It' stands for the noun 'Weather'.  \"for the ball game\" is an adjunct used because what follows \"for the ball game?\" is not 'Weather' which would make 'Weather for the ballgame' which doesn't sound natural, that's why we need to replace it with a noun.  So out of the given options:\n1. Option A is not correct.  'Ball game' modifies noun 'it' and 'for the' is not the correct usage of preposition in such a case.\n2. Option E is incorrect. 'too' cannot be used before the 'beautiful' and then 'for the beautiful day' would be used as it is not the correct usage.\n3. Option D is the correct choice as we can use the noun with an infinitive as seen here \"A lovely day for baseball gams.\" is the correct choice.\n\nInput: I wanted to buy a gift that my brother would love in which of the following stores?

Choices: 1) standing straight 2) sitting 3) crouched 4) lying 5) kneeling\nOutput: 1: The answer is standing straight.\n2: The options'sitting', 'crouched', 'lying', 'kneeling' are wrong.\n3: 'crouched' can be described as sitting in a crouched position, but if the description says 'crouched', the options'sitting' and'standing straight' are irrelevant.\n4: 'lying' makes no sense.

Thus, it would be inefficient to rely solely on the Internet for information. \n4 A Library would be a more reliable location for finding information. \n5 Firstly, libraries may have access to rare and hard-to-find texts, which might contain invaluable information. \n6 Secondly, libraries are regulated spaces for storing and preserving knowledge, which means they're dedicated to providing only high-quality information. \n7 In contrast, search engines gather information from many sources without quality checks, and it's easy to find wrong or misleading information. \n8 The Internet may be the fastest and easiest way to get information, but it doesn't necessarily provide the most valuable content.\n9 However, a library can be the best option for finding invaluable information.\n10 Accordingly, the most valuable information on any topic can be found in a library. \n11 Therefore, the answer to the question is E: in an encyclopaedia. \nSo the final answer to which is the most valuable resource for finding information about a topic? is D: in an encyclopedia.\n\nInput: A group is in a long line, everyone is at the same location, the group needs to decide who should go next, who should be next?

{"text": "would an archaeologist expect to see the earliest writing? Choices:  C: outside the house B: on the floor D: in a museum E: in the basement\nOutput: 1 - The question asks where an archaeologist would expect to find the earliest writing. \n2 - The question gives us some context that the archaeologist has already found writing on the floor, and that writing is most commonly found outside the house. \n3 - We know that writing is found in most places across history, so we can't expect there to be a certain pattern just because of the question being from the Mesopotamia region where cuneiform was invented. \n4 - However, the options are all fairly logical: \n5 - 'on the floor' would imply a more casual recording of information, whereas 'in a museum' would most likely be found in a repository for artifacts that have been excavated from the ancient civilization. \n6 - 'outside the house' would make the most sense in a settlement because writing was most likely used to document ownership of land or mark significant events. \n7 - 'in the basement' would imply a more recent writing that's been preserved in some way. \n8 - So, if we have no other information to help us solve the question, we choose the option 'on the floor' the most because of the given context and because 'on the floor' seems the most likely place according to the information given. \n9 - However, we know that there is some context that already mentions the earliest writing they found at the site was 'on the floor', which indicates that the earliest writing they found is 'on the floor'. \n10 - So, the answer is 'on the floor', with 'outside the house'being the second answer choice. \n11 - Since the context implies the earliest writing found on the floor, the answer choice of 'outside the house ', and not actually 'on the floor', is wrong. \n12 - The question is asking where we would expect to find writing - the answer choice is 'outside the house', not necessarily 'on the floor', so we would select that answer.\nSo the final answers are C: \"outside the house\", B: \"on the floor\"\n\n# \n# \ud83d\ude45\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "will the wind come from to help the sail move? Choices:  WA: Northward BS: Southward CE: Eastward FU: Westward VI: It must travel to a different direction altogether.\nOutput: 1) When we travel on a boat/ship, generally the wind travels in the opposite direction of the way the boat travels. When traveling in the direction of west, the wind travels to the east, and when traveling in the direction north, the force of wind will travel towards the south, and so on. Therefore, the answer has to either be FU Westward or BS Southward.\n2) Now, FU Westward may sound a good answer, but we have forgotten that the question has said that the wind has to travel to a different direction. Now, since there are three directions that we have already marked to be wrong (FU, CE & V), the only two options left are BS (Southward) & WA (Northward).\nSo the final answer has to be either BS or WA\n\nInput: How does the brain know to make a choice between actions we are taught.

Choices:  A. where you grew up B. where you have the money C. where you have roots D. where you like the people E. where no one bothers you\nOutput: 1: It\u2019s important to analyze the context behind the question: a man wants to know where to find a new apartment.\n2. We will look to infer options based on key information from this context.\n3. First, consider time. It\u2019s often the case that the length of time you\u2019re planning to spend in a new home plays a significant role in your answer.\n4. In the given options:\n5. \"C\" and \"E\" are eliminated as they don't have any time-related restrictions.\n6. \"B\" and \"D\" have a clear connection to time:\n7. \"B\" is the option is related to how long you are employed in a new location i.e. if you stay in a location for a longer time than you should look for an apartment.\n8. This is most likely the option because the question mentions that this factor needs to be considered to answer the question.\n7. \"D\" is the only option that suggests you should consider your roots i.e. where you were born or where you grew up.\n8. This option makes the most sense given the information about time provided in the context.\n8. There is no clear relationship between \"A\" and \"E\" to the time factors mentioned in the context, therefore, eliminating those two options.\n9. We can reasonably infer that the only remaining option that works with the given context and time constraints is \"C\" i.e. where will the man stay for at least a minimum period of time, and where there are other options for him to remain for longer if he wishes.\n10. This eliminates the options as they give vague or ambiguous information regarding time.\n11. Hence, the answer is B.\n12. So the final answer is B.\n\nInput: Who is the most popular president?

The question gives a situation where \"a man wearing a hat\" entered a toy store and began looking at toys. After looking at a doll, he took it out and examined it, then put the doll back on the shelf and left the toy store. \n2. There are only two logical possibilities: standing in the store (option A) or standing outside the store (option B). \n3. The options don't provide any information about the presence of other people such as store clerks, store patrons, or employees.\n4. Since the question specifies that \"a man wearing hat\" was standing, option B: standing outside cannot be correct. \n5.

Thus, the most plausible outcome of the situation is that \"the person\" stood (option A: in store) to look at the doll placed on the shelf. \n7. The following table provides a detailed analysis of the options: \n8. B: standing outside is out of question as discussed above. \n9. A: standing in store is the most likely option because the doll(inside store only) was taken out (only inside) and examined and also put back on the shelf (again only inside). \n10.

Hiding the box would seemingly be quite easy, but the option that has not been chosen is still available.\n4. Here, the person has to hide the box to avoid its getting seen & discovered. Thus, they might have to think what is the best place to do that.\n5. Considering the given options, it makes no sense to hide it in the bathroom or kitchen, since these options suggest that someone could easily spot the box. \n6. So the box could be hidden in the bedroom or closet\n7. However, there again, if anyone else was staying with the person, they could very easily walk inside the bedroom or closets.\n8.

A museum, when there is an exhibition going on\nOutput: 1) The options can be a) (i) or b) (ii), c) (i), (iii), (iv), or (v). We see that b (ii) and c (i) do not match the clue - people are having interesting conversations. Similarly, a) (i) does not mean that the place is crowded with people, and (iii) does not mean that people are introduced at the party. Hence, we rule these out.\n2) For each answer, if people are having interesting conversions, then the place must either be crowded (b), overcrowded (c) or filled to the brim (v). Out of these, III does not fit, as people are not introduced to each other, hence being overcrowded or having many guests at a party does not mean that every person will know each other. Similarly, for V i.e. a museum, we see, from the question, that the people will be conversing, but conversations will not be about the art piece. Hence, V does not match the clue either.\n3) So, we are left with only I and VI, and for these, since there are no clues, we decide that if interesting conversations are happening it must be at a gym or during a play/musical.\n4) Hence our answer is VI.e. during a play/muscial.\nSo the final score is 3.

In order to find the destination with \u201cBest Jazz\u201d, we have to identify the answer which has \u201cBest Jazz\u201d along with the \u201cJazz\u201d or \u201cClubs\u201d or \u201cNight Clubs\u201d or \u201cBroadway Theatres\u201d.\n3.) Since \u201cBest Jazz\u201d is not found in the destination \u201cTheatre Theatres\u201d, we can deduce that no answer is a \u201cBest Jazz\u201d one.\n4.)

The word initiative has a completely different meaning than the other options. The initiative doesn't refer to the act of getting ready to go, but to an individual's qualities or personal attributes.\n2. All the provided words have something to do with physical activity.\n3. Meditation and Hiking refer to activities performed by the individual on a regular basis. They do not specify where the individual spends his/her time doing these activities.\n4. Hence the given answers are - meditation (A, C) and hiking (C).\n5. Based on the hints provided, it is clear that our option is B (Initiative).\n6. So the correct answer has to be E (Gym).\nSo the final answer does not require an option as per the hints given.\n\nInput: What are they discussing? They're discussing the what? Choices: A: way to communicate B: ways of talking C: ways of being social D: ways of talking and listening to each other E: other ways of communication\nOutput: 12. The way to communicate has two words. If they discuss talking, that means they are talking about a different way of communication other than talking.\n2. It is not possible for them to discuss the way to talk in the way they talked in the previous line.\n3. It is also not possible for them to talk to each other, since they weren't talking yet.\n4. That means the right option is talking and listening to each\n5. Other ways of communication cannot be an option since they won't discuss talking in general, and it's not talking about another type of communication.\n6. Therefore the correct answer has to E (other ways of communication).\nSo the final option is E (other ways of communicating)", "answer": " 10"}

Other options \"They have feelings and opinions\" (1st part) \"They use technology.\" (3rd part)\n5. Because as photographers are concerned they do not have a feeling themselves, they can't capture a moment in photograghy since it is their lenses that do (if at all they capture) and they aren't inspirited to do what they do.\n6.

Testosterone is an androgen; androgens have two primary roles: primary and secondary sexual characteristics and the development of the male gonads.\n3. From the options: pituitary, penis, prostate, and eyebrows; only, the first two are androgens; The eyebrows are hair-bearing regions of skin. Thus, we can eliminate eyebrows.\n4. When we compare the third and fourth options, 'prostate gland' is the most obvious answer because it is the second sex organ in males after the penis.\n5. From the question, they only tell us about 'where' does it occur, they don't mention about the level difference. So, the 'highest' or 'lowest' would not necessarily be required.

Both are complete phrases. \n5) Sentences 1 & 5 are both of incomplete sentences making statements and we can infer that the locations will be to the right or left of the park or close to the hospital or close to the hospital.\n6) We can eliminate #1 & #5 \n7) Sentence 3 has an \"at\". This tells us that the location is to the left and also tells us that this location is most likely in the city of the same name. \n8) We can then eliminate options A,C,D from the list since these do not give us any helpful hints towards locations in the city.

At university, the cafeteria, in their houses: I'd already have a passcode to go.\n5. Only in their houses would have the same passcode.\n6. If the answer was either A, B, C, or D, the likely answer would be either in a bar or in a university cafeteria.\n7.

What does that mean? Choices:  C: short-armed D: underdeveloped E: stubby F: short-statured\nOutput: 1.We have a bunch of people. \n2. 'The tallest of the bunch' implies that the tallest person is not as tall as it can potentially be, compared to other people in the group.\n3.'still short-legged' means it is short compared to other people. \n4. We can deduce that being the tallest still implies being short compared to someone else. \n5. Hence, we can pick either short-arm or underdeveloped or stubby. \n6. All of them mean being short compared to other people in some way or another, and as indicated, short-arm and short-legged are interchangeable in that regard.\n7. If the answer is short-arm, then we eliminate underdeveloped, and if it is underdeveloped, then we eliminate stubby. \n8. This leaves us with only the word'short-legged'.\n9. Hence, the answer is'short-legged.\nSo the final final answer is D: short-legged\n\nInput: How many hours a day do they work? Choices:  E: 9:30 - 5:30\nOutput: 1.)

{"text": "can people go to avoid being caught in a rip current? Choices:  N/A\nOutput: 1.) The passage states that people need to know about rip currents and where to go to avoid getting caught in them. It suggests that they could avoid being caught in a current if they choose to go to a certain place. Based on the context, the options will be beaches, pools, ocean, river, stream.\n2.) While beaches, pools and rivers could be places where people can go to avoid being caught up in a rip current, the ocean would be much more likely. \n3.) A rip current occurs when the sea is at the shore and when the tide pulls out. In the ocean, the tide is often quite strong and the currents can be difficult to traverse. \n4.) Furthermore, since rip currents are typically found in the sea, ocean would be the option most relevant in the context.\n5.)

It's possible that it's made all around the country, but it's definitely not made everywhere. \n2 So narrow the options down to where it makes the most sense to make the pie.\n3 Considering that the pie is seasonal, and the autumn is a season that's celebrated in the southwest, the pie is most likely to be made in the southwest.\n4 The Pacific coast has nothing to do with making pumpkin pies and the Midwest isn't traditionally known for any sort of pie-making.\n5 The 'South, east' isn't a complete sentence and doesn't make sense grammatically - in a list of options, it should be the final one.\n6 Therefore, the answer is (1) Southwest.\nSo the final answers are: (1): Southwest (2): Pacific coast (3): Newyork (4): Midwest (5): South, east\n\nInput: She has a lot of what on the back of her bike?

For example, the rose garden is a common name for the rose garden.\n12. So the correct option can be out of one of the above options.\n13. F: In front of Porch: This seems to be in wrong position as Porch implies a place for parking(where the car can go).\n14. G: Near front door: This is a bit ambiguous, as it may refer to the house or the front door. We need to think about this option again.\n15.

This indicates that she thought the food was terrible.\n2) She does not like the food based on the way it tastes or smells (A and B).\n3) She did not like the menu or the drinks served at the restaurant (D and E).\n4) Since we have already discarded food (A), menu (D), drinks (E), then waitress (B) is the likely answer choice.\n5) The phrase \"too many times\" means that she had eaten at that restaurant once before. Since (B) does not give us any indication that she has experienced dining at that restaurant before or that she knows something wrong about the waitress, waitress cannot be the answer.\n6) The phrase \"toe many times\" implies that she had a different experience at the restaurant with regard to the waitress. Since (B) clearly indicates that she has known the waitress, that cannot be the answer either.\n7) It is more likely that she didn't like the manner the waitress served the food (B). \n8) Therefore, the most likely answer is C. the manner in which the food was served.\nSo the final anwer is C. the manner the food was served", "answer": " 7"}

The word \"fair\" is generally used to define a public gathering for the purpose of trade or entertainment, but it could potentially be used to describe a place where you can find creative ideas. However, in this case, they are describing it in the context of artistic creation, not commercial activity, so a \"fair\" doesn't seem like the best place for an artist to find new ideas for their work. \n\nOption D and E are out of scope.\n\nIn short, the author is referring to a gallery or market for an artist to get ideas for their artwork.\nSo the final chosen answer is: B: market", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "can a business get the most bang for their buck? Choices: 1. A: a new truck 2. B: a new business 3. C: a new car 4. D: a new laptop\nOutput: 1.\"Bang for your Buck\" is a common idiom used to describe the concept of getting a good deal. \n2. \"A new truck\", \"A new business\", or \"A new car\" are all examples of buying something new that may provide more value or a better return on investment than \"A new laptop,\" which already exists and is a commonly purchased and used item. \n3.

{"text": "an iceberg comes to rest, a lot of ocean surface area will eventually evaporate into what? Choices: A: water vapor B: clouds C: steam D: snow E: ice cubes\nOutput: 1: In a glacier, when ice is removed from an ice floe, many cubes of ice break off. \n2. When the ice breaks off into the freezing ocean surrounding the iceberg, the ice quickly melts. \n3. The liquid water from the melting process then evaporates into the atmosphere. \n4. It rises to the cold, dry air above, and becomes clouds. \n5. Once the water vapor condenses, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow. \n6. This cycle of melting and evaporating creates a constant movement of water vapor between the oceans and the atmosphere over a glacier's term.\n7. In this sense, the water from a glacier can be characterized as clouds or precipitation evaporating from the planet's ocean.\n8. Though clouds and snowfall often occur over the ocean and the land, icebergs often rest on land for months or even years before they finally sink back into the ocean.\n9. It thus follows that we can discard E: ice cubes as they are created from frozen water that has melted elsewhere.\n10. Thus, the answer must be B: clouds or C: steam.\nSo the final correct answer is C: steam\n\nInput: On a boat or a submarine, where would one typically find navigation?

The choice that has a negative statement is the choice that is most incorrect. As stated earlier, every correct answer should only contain statements which are true. This means that choice C is incorrect. Now we can go on to rule out others answers from the rest as we do not add any wrong information through any of the choices. Choice D is incorrect because the word choice states that dinosaurs were very big and fierces. Also, they were definitely not living under the ocean because dinosaurs are terrestrial and they did not even have wings. Hence, dinosaurs cannot live under the ocean as the only way they can live there is through using the method of amphibiosity. Choice A is also incorrect because the only living organisms on the earth today are primates. Now we can also rule out choice B because all animal species in the world live on earth and this is a given fact. Hence, choice B is incorrect. Choice D is also incorrect even though it is true because all statements are correct, but some of them are incomplete and some are redundant informations. For example, \"They lived under the ocean\" can also be replaced with \"They were amphibious\". So, choice D is also incorrect. In result, we can conclude that choice B is the most correct because they all live on earth. So, the final answer is B. They lived on earth.\nSo the final ans is B.

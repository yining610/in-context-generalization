(oil refineries)\n\nReasoning:  In these math problems, the letters before the comma, indicate a word, and the letters after the comma, are a combination of two or maybe more words. In this one, the letters are A, B, C, and D. For each word you have to find a place. A place can be a house, a shop, etc..\n\nA place in this case should not involve water or water fountains, because the user will not be thirst.\n\nOne possible answer is:\n\n\"A person who are not thirsty, is a possible worker of an oil refinery.\"\n\n## Part 2\n\nFor question B, the answer is B. (response)\n\nReason: Same reasoning as part, and the answer is:\n\n    \"When you call out to someone, it does not involve an oil refinery. It involves a response. \"\n\n## Part 3\n\nFor question C, the answer is A, (office)\n\nReason 1:\n\nWhen one person calls out to another, they are likely to be outside and not in an office. Also, in order to find pens with a company symbol, one may look into their office and have access to pens.\n\nReason 2:\n\nIn order to buy pens with a company symbol one must visit an office. One also needs to access paper and a writing implement.\n\n## Part 4\n\nFor question D, the answer is D, (rock)\n\nWhen you call out to a person and receive a response, you are likely to be outdoors. Also the person who calls out is likely to be frightened by an animal. For example a lizard or s", "answer": " 4"}

When a number is multiplied by another number, the product is a resultant of that multiplication. \n\n2. To multiply by 10, simply add the number ten or 10 times to the number.\n\n3. This gives us a base-ten numeration system.\n\n4. Multiplication of two numbers on a calculator adds the ten to both of them before calculating the product.\n\n5. Example: 100\u00d727= 100+100+1=100+110-1=111\n\n6. Multiplication of numbers on a calculator is equivalent to adding ten to the number ten times before calculating the product. Therefore, there is no need to remove 10 from the answer after multiplying.\n\n7. Multiplication by ten is the product of ten times the dividend on a calculator.\n\n8. The key to multiplying by 10 is always to multiply by ten, as we can see from the above division.\n\n9. Using the method above, the 10 will be multiplied by the number.\n\n10. Multiply by one by multiplying a number by one.\n\n11. Using a base-ten system to multiply by ten is the multiplication of the first ten or so times ten by the number.", "answer": " 32"}

When he got hit, he'd scream at the top of his lungs, and then wait with his head covered for the teacher who was late for work. Once they met, they'd talk with each other for 5 minutes, and then go about their day. After 6 months of this, the boy changed his schedule and woke up at 1:00.

{"text": "$150\n\nInput: In mathematics, addition is one of the four main operations of arithmetic, which along with subtraction, multiplication, and division enable one to perform all arithmetic operations. The mathematical symbol for addition is +, the verbal symbol is to add. In mathematics, addition of two whole numbers or of a whole number and a fraction is referred to as \"addition with whole numbers\". In arithmetic, 0 is the additive identity element for the integers, that is, a + 0 = a for each integer a.\n\nThere are five different methods for addition of whole-numbers, each with a different number of operations. These are addition with carrying (the method used by children for addition below the teens), column addition, line addition, bar diagrams and vertical addition. The addition with carrying method needs the most operations, whereas vertical addition and bar diagrams each need at most three operations.\n\nInput: In most programming languages like C, C++, Java and some other languages, the assignment operator is denoted by the = sign. It assigns the value of the variable on the left to the variable or operand or variable on the right. The left hand operand is called left hand side (LHS) and the right hand operand is called right hand side (RHS). On the right side of the =, the value goes in, but on the left side the value comes out.\n\nInput: If you have two variables in an assignment operation, and you use a third variable to perform an operation on the other two, you use the ampersand '&' as an operator. With two variables and one operator the operator doesn't need any parenthesis '()', the right is left as is, it will do the operator in any order.\n\nInput: How can you help the person who lost his wallet? \n\n\nIf you found a wallet on the street, the person probably left his purse behind and you just found it by mistake. \n\nIf the wallet is empty, then you probably think that you'll get something useful in the wallet and give it to that person. \n\nOutput: A: You could try to return it.", "answer": " 92"}

There wasn't a bookstore within a reasonable distance.  The book was The Great Gatsby, a book  that is often taught in high school. It was written by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  The book was first published in 1925 and went by the title Trimalchio in West Egg.  The first person narrative, told in the form of letters from a character named Nick Carraway to his friend, is a description of the time he spent in West Egg. West Egg was the wealthy half of the suburban area across the bay from Manhattan, while East Egg referred to the more socially prominent half.  The book was a success and has been republished many times.  It continues to be widely read in high schools and is often taught in universities.  Some of the ideas contained in the book are well-known to anyone who has read other of Fitzgerald's works, such as his short stories or The Beautiful and Damned.  The book's characters, including Jay Gatsby and Daisy Buchanan, were based on people who Fitzgerald met, befriended or just observed.  Fitzgerald struggled throughout his life and the book has been seen as a reflection of that.  Fitzgerald was born on September 24, 1896, and died in Hollywood on December 21, 1940, at the age of 44, with almost no money. It seems appropriate that F. Scott Fitzgerld's life story is often told along with the story of his most famous character, Jay Gatsby.  Fitzgerald's legacy is not just the book, but also his ability to describe a time and a place in American history with a literary", "answer": " 21"}

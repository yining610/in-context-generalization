{"text": "H: 16\n\n### Step 1\n\n### Step in the Right Direction\n\nWe would start this challenge with a simple search on Google searching for \"instruction-based grade\", \"instruction-based\", \"instruction-inquiry-based learning\" and similar. This search query led us to numerous resources on the topic and in particular a paper by Mourshed, McQueen, and Levin which was particularly insightful in terms of learning about the instruction-based method. In addition, we also searched for the term 'instruction' on Google in an attempt to obtain additional resources that are related indirectly to this topic. It should be noted that Google is not an ideal source for getting a research based perspective on an issue. On this basis, most likely only additional non-research resources should be found on Google and other search engines.\n\nIn terms of looking at the resources we found with our research queries, there is evidence of various types of instruction. For example, it was found that there were several videos on instruction-based grading systems which illustrated how these grading systems were implemented in practice. Additionally, it was found that the authors of the paper we found provided links to numerous other resources on the instruction-based grading system such as a document on the use of a pre and post survey to assess implementation. It also appears that the resources we found did not necessarily reflect all views on the instruction-based method of grading.\n\n### Step Back in the Right Direction \n\nIn order to ensure we are on the right path, I decided to utilize a more formal approach. We utilized the research process used by many academics and researchers to ensure we were doing the appropriate steps to conduct our research. We decided to use the PICOT method (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Time Frame). Within the resources we consulted, there are two populations that we can analyze that relate to our research. These two populations of interest are the educators and high school students who are both impacted by our research.\n\n#### Step 1a: \n\nOne population of interest is the teachers that participated within the research on instruction-based grads. It is possible that certain teachers are against this particular idea from the outset and therefore did not partake in the research of instruction-based grads and others agreed with the concept altogether from the start. It would be reasonable", "answer": " 31"}

He buys one product, which costs 5 euros more than the other. How many products can the person buy without exceeding his budget?\nOutput: A person can buy 1 or 2 products.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe first question is about cities and the natural viewpoint of humans. Choice C: park is the correct answer because there is a wide space for us to see the natural view so the best natural view could be seen on a park. \nThe second question is about a student who went to the cinema every week with a budget of $120. We know that he went to the cinema every two weeks and if we only go twice a week, we will only spend $72. In my opinion, I think that there are several possible answers and none of them can guarantee that you only spend $120. \nThe third question is about a person who enters into a supermarket, he only needs to buy 5 euros for each product and one product costs 5 euros. We know that he has a budget of 11 euros and he needs to buy at least 2 products. What we should note is that you will not buy a 2-product, which costs you 12 euros (11 + 11); it should be 1 or 2.

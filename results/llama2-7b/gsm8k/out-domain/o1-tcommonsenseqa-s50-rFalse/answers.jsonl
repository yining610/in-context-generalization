If X = 2 then the last digit of your even number is 2, which was our 0th integer, so therefore is even, so summing these will result in your even number, except that if you have two numbers with the same parity, their sum will be equal to that parity. So, since we are only considering integers 6 and above, we can conclude that X and the parity of your sum are one.\n\n### Response :\n\nInput:\nWait 241 days.\n\n\n### Input : You're making chocolate chip cupcakes for 62 people.

Ground-level ozone can develop during the day, depending on the weather and the types of pollutants in the air. Ozone can harm human health and living vegetation. Carbon monoxide can affect human health and living vegetations. Ozone is associated with health and environmental effects, including cardiovascular problems, premature aging of the lungs, cancer, and plant damage.

{"text": "The most money the plumber could make in this case comes from fixing two toilets and three showers at the second apartment complex because it costs $50 for each toilet and shower and then only costs $30 for the sink.  The total amount the plumber would make on this specific job is $1100.  The second amount from the highest to the lowest is $720 from the third job.  The next highest would be from the first job which is $660.\n\n### Explanation:In this case the plumber must choose what job he should take out of only 3 options. The first option has him fixing 3 toilets and 3 sinks.  The second option has him fixing 2 toilets and 5 sinks.  The third choice has him fixing 1 toilet, 2 showers and 3 sinks and the plumber only charges $50 to fix each toilet and $40 to fix each sink.  We are using this information to find how much he can make of one job. So all we need to do is figure out how much he would make with one specific job and multiply it by what his choice is then this would be his result. \n\nExample:What is 7(8x9)?\nAnswer:7(8x9)\n\n\n#### 0. \t\t\nThe correct number would be the third option because there are no choices that would beat the last choice. In the first, second, and third choices, the sinks cost more for the plumber to repair than the toilets. \n\n####\nThe last one has him taking on 3 toilets, 3 sinks, 2 showers, and only 3 would be the last choice because it would help the plumber earn $50 because the money it would cost him to fix these fixtures, toilets, and showers would earn him the most money.", "answer": " 250"}

{"text": "The answer is 4258\n\n### Answer:\nThe answer is 45075\n\n### Demostration:\nHere is how I made the right result \nAnswer:The shingles on the house and the porcah need to have a total length of 20 feet. The shingles on the porch need to be 14 feet long. The shingles used in a rectangular roof are all the same length and all on the same side of the roof. So the shingles used for the house need to be twice as long as the shingles on the perch. Also, the perch will need 3 times as much shingles as the house. So the length of shingles on the roof of both the house and the porsh is 20*2x3 = 60 feet.\nThe area of a square roof is length squared over 2. So 100 divided by 2 is 50. So the length of the roof of the house is 50 feet long. The length of a rectangular roof is length squared. So 50*50 is 2500. So the length needed for the rectangular roof is 250 feet long.\nSince this rectangle is a rectangle, we know that the same side of the rectangle is also twice as long as the other side. So the width is 7.5 feet long.\nThe area of the perch is 4.5 feet squared times 4 = 18. So the length of square for the perch is 22.5 feet.\nThe area for the house is 58.5 feet square. So the length of a square is 10.416 feet.\nLastly 4258 is the answer because the area for the perch is greater than the area at the house.\n\n### Comment:\nI will work on my math but I think its mostly good\n\n### Mark:\n[ ] (\u2714\ufe0f) Correct!\n\n[x] (\u2716\ufe0f) There were mistakes in your answer\n\n[ ] (\u2714) Your response was in appropriate response type", "answer": " 232"}

{"text": "For a whole month, the Italian restaurant will earn $14,000 for a whole month if it earns $60,000 per week ($600 multiplied by five days per week).\n\nSo, multiply the first answer by 4: 14,009\n\n### Example:\nFor example, you could write the following code using the provided library:\n```python\nimport math\n\nanswer = \"C: park\"\n```\n\nThis solution returns the number of weeks by using the number of Sundays that are in a year. The answer should also return the Sundays that do not exist in the month, if it does:\n```python\nmonth = 4\nweeks = math.trunc(month/2)\nif weeks == 1: \n    end_of_year = year + 1\nelse: \n    endOfYear = year\nwhile endOfyear == wee:\n    weeks += 1\n    endOfYear += 1\nanswer = str(weeks)\n```\n\nHowever, the other option is to write it out the other way. The first formula may be used without any prior knowledge to arrive at the answer. The second formula uses the formula that is less difficult to implement.\n\nAs demonstrated below, the formula above was used to return an answer. If it does not return an answer, then the weekday should be divided by 16 and rounded towards zero. For instance, if it were asked about a Wednesday, it should return an answer of 1/4 or \"W:\".\n\n### Example\nIn order to demonstrate the response below:\n```python\nweekday = 4\nwee = weekday / (16 * 60)\nif wee%16 == 0:\n    weekday = \"B:\"\nelse:\n    weekday=\"C:\"\n```\n\nThe formula above returns an answer of \"C,\" given that two weeks remain and that the response of the formula above is two weeks. In the first example, the answer is not C, since it is not weekend, but 4. For the second formula to calculate when the weekend happens, we can use two months' worth of weekends and work backwards to arrive at the end of the weekend, then the beginning of the next week.\n\n###", "answer": " 21600"}

{"text": "I think she will spend $148.5 dollars.\n1.  Susans first step would be to find how many servings she is getting. 20 servings.  Each serving is 2 bowls of food.  Each bowl will require you  to take 2 potatoes and 1 taspoon of salt, and 1 serving has 2 bowls of that.  Therefore, you need $40 per serving. 2.  Since we need 20 bowls of food, and each bowl has two, she need to buy 20 bowls. Each bowl has a salt, which equals to 5 in the bowl,  and a bowl has.50 in it, since there is.10 for each potato, and 1 bowl calls for 2 potatoes,  we can get.05 per bowl,  but that equals to.5 a bowl. 3.  Since we have 20 bowls, and we need 50 salt, we need 25 bowls of salt. This is.5 a bowl but with.25 in it. 4.  Now we have to add it.  First we got 20 bowls for a meal, 8.6 bowls of salt. We can see here that Susan needed 28.6 of salt. So we need 1 bowl of salt,  and to do that many times for how many guests they were having.  Susan needs 30 bowls, the total comes out to be $148.75 per meal. To sum it all in, if the food costs $148.65, and the Salt costs $148, she has $150\n\n### Notes: \n-\n\n### Expected Behavior: \n-\n-\n-\n\n## [1]: https://github.com/WoodstockSouth/AITutoring\n## [2]: https://github.nl/\n## [3]: https://github.io", "answer": " 12"}

First you find the difference between the answer to the problem and also what the temp is at. The temp is at 8 so 32+temp=40, so 40-32 = the temp the answer is in steps 2. Then you simply take it out into a decimal point by multiplying 365 to it. Next you take the 365 to the top of the equation, and make it larger than the 60 in the formula. You multiply the 60 by 9, and add that to the number.

Since the parrots are 8 and we will triple the number of snakes then we will triple the number the number of monkeys.

This formula will replace the the total number of parraoits, snakes and monkies with 8 to get the difference between the zebras to the monkies.\nNow we multiply by 10 and we will get the final answer 360.\n\n### Comment:\nThank you for your question and I hope this comment helps you learn math.. :)", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "A: $130\n\n\n### Instructions:What are the five classes of volcanoes that exists in the world\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer:Class #5: Strombolian\n\n\n### Class 5: Stromboli\n\nThe typical Strombolian may be either highly explosive, producing frequent moderate-sized explosions, or less explosive, producing smaller, almost continuous weak explosions. The most active and best-studied of these volcanoes is Mount Stromboli, the volcano that gave its name to this class.\n\n### Class: 4: Vulcanian\n\nA Vulcanian eruption consists of many small, fast-moving fragments projected during a brief phreatic explosion, with no lava, ash, or tephra deposited. Vulcanian eruptive activity is most commonly associated with conical volcanoes with small craters in the form of a lava plug forming. The word Vulcania is Latin for the name of Mount Vulcano, the island in the Bay of Naples upon whose summit lies the volcano Vesuvius, a volcanic activity type associated with Vesuvius.\n\n### 3: Plinian\n\n\nPliny, whose writings on geology and volcanoes provide the only major historical source for the ancient geography of the Roman Empire, named this eruption type. The term was extended to the eruption from Vesuvius in 79 AD, the best-known and most studied Plinian eruption. Plinian eruptions produce more lava than Strombolian eruptions and much more tephra than Vulcanian erruptions. The erupted hot gas and lava fragments are blown up to great heights by the force of the eruption, so that they can travel hundreds of kilometers away from their source.\n\n### Answer:2: Hawaiian\n\nAlso known as \"hotspot\" or \"intraplate\" volcanoes, this class of volcanoes arise from a hotspot in the Earth's crust, which has created one or more volcanoes over millions of years. These volcanoes are normally found over an oceanic plate.\n\n###", "answer": " 99"}

{"text": "There are a total of 45 push-ups.\n\n### Input :You\u2019re a high school student and you are on your way to class. The class is on the 2nd floor in a building that is 5 floors tall. There is an elevator as well as 5 flights of stairs that you can use to get to the second floor. If you want to travel faster, you may choose to take the elevator instead of the stairs and you may continue to choose the elevator every time. On the other hand, if you\u2019d like to be a little more environmentally conscious, you may take the stairs.\n\n### Response :The stairs are a better choice because there are less moving parts compared to elevator. If the stairs were to run out of batteries, you can still use your body weight to help propel you down the stairs. Elevators would cause more problems. Elevators will break down, stop working, etc. If it stopped working half way up, people would have to use the stairs for the remainder of the trip. If an elevator broke down part way down, people would still have to use the stair to get down and would have to deal with that stressful situation. In summary, the stairs are better because of the fewer moving parts, and if the stairs were to break down people would still be able to travel down safely. The elevators are better because elevators can take you all the way to the top floor, but they also require much more maintenance. The longer it takes to do maintenance, fewer people will choose to take the elevators.\n\n### Demo : Input: You run into an open field in the morning on a 10km loop. You run 10km, and then 14km, and then 22km, etc. until 100km. Once you reach 100km, you end the race. The distance you ran is the number of miles you\u2019ve run.\n\n### Solution : Miles per hour = Your distance(mile) / T (hours) To calculate how many mile per hour you are running, you need to divide the number of mile you ran, by the number of hours you ran.\n\n### Example Input : Yara is thinking about taking calculus. She wants to learn from a teacher's online lecture, while she does", "answer": " 40"}

A production line that produces more product in a day is said to be \u2018efficient\u2019 in production.\nIn order to efficiently produce 50 CPUs, the amount I would need to make the line more efficient would be to divide the number of CPU per line which 50 CPU \u00f7 30 CPU = 2.

{"text": "This question will be an easy one for people in tech. Movie theaters always use all 6 screens to the fullest since customers have been conditioned to pay for the convenience of seeing more movies. That means that they will show 12 movies back to back.\n\n### Input/Demonstration:\nChoices: A: the weather forecast for this weekend was 60 degrees, overcast, and high chance of precipitation. B: The weather forecast for this winter is 65 degrees, sunny, and clear and not a cloud in sight. C: Both A and B make me happy. D: Both A and B fill me with dread. Choose and explain your choice.\n\n- D: Both A and  B fill me with dread\n\n### Response\nWarmer weather (D) in the forecast brings joy to nearly everyone. The sunny forecast can even bring joy in more than one way. For a lot of families, having the choice to  go to the beach or for an  ice cream  is a way to help  children be relaxed and keep  them from  crying  or  getting  too  angry during these times. However, the rain brings sorrow of an event being cancelled for  the  time being, not being able to  play fetch or run around. It also makes  it  harder to take nature photos  and  videos. There is  also  a  negative  sentiment  about  spending too  much  money  on  sunscreen  and  sweaters for the weather that was promised all year.\n\nThis question is an example of a question that a person can answer at will, and the answer  can  be  an  opinion, or a  response  to  a  personal  feeling  or  preference.

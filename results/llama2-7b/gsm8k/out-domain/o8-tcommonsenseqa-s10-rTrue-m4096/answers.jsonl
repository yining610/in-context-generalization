Hurricanes are tropical storms that can produce strong winds, heavy rainfall, and flooding.\n3. Option A: \"Desert\" would be an unlikely location for a hurricane since deserts are typically dry and arid.\n4. Option D: \"Desert\" is also plausible. Deserts typically have less moisture than other areas, but they can still experience flooding caused by rainfall from tropical storms.\n5.

{"text": "Each top cost $21.25.\n\n### Explanation:\nSolution: First, we note the statement that for $75, Ann bought: \"5 pairs of shorts\" for $7 each, and \"2 pairs of shoes\" for $10 each.\" To calculate the cost of each pair of shorts, just subtract $7 from $75 dollars and obtain the answer as $68, but when she bought 5 pairs, we subtract $5 to find $63 for the final cost, and we note that this means that each pair cost $63 dollars. The tops, however, are less obvious, but the problem states clearly \"at the same price\" which, considering the fact that each top costs the same amount of money, means there can be a maximum of 3 different rates for the tops, since there are only 4 tops, we can write the equation: \"T = $3X\", where T is 3 dollars, which means that $3 equals 3 dollars, thus each top costs $33.33. Therefore, since 5 pairs of short equal 5 times $63 and we end up with 4 tops because of the clearance, we can state that the problem is asking \"how much did each $63 short + 4 $3 tops equals $96?\"", "answer": " 5"}

Choices:  A : question  B : problem  C : explanation  D : suggestion E : answer\nRationales:1. The expression \"what is the first half of\" implies that there is a separate second half, so the choices will likely be phrased to express different elements of a full sentence or statement.\n2. The elements given describe how to learn from a problem statement, rather than being two stages of learning.\n3. The two-stage model involves asking questions and getting answers in order to gain understanding, rather than one step being called the \"first half\".\n4. Given the other choice elements, the most likely \"second half\" is \"an explanation\", so the logical answer is C.\n5. However, all of the options can actually be divided into questions asking for information or problems asking for the creation of a solution, so this \"first step\" concept is not specific enough to eliminate the options.\n6. The phrases \"what is the first\" or \"what is the first part\" can be used to clarify if the problem is describing the first half of the process, but this is an extremely informal usage in a formal question.\n7. The phrase \"half of\" suggests a specific relationship to a whole, so eliminating the options by analyzing all of the words in the expression will take a lot of time that can be avoided by applying basic rules of grammar.\n8. The options generally describe ways of learning, and there is no clear order in which they should be presented, so it is not possible to determine which option comes first.\n9.

{"text": "The total number of meows will be 3 times number of units of time in 5 minutes, which is 25, because each cat makes 3 meows per minute and the combined total number of cats is 3. Therefore the answer is C, 75.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The cats sit on a fence. \n2. From the given information that: \n    There are three cats. \n    The first cat meowed three times per minute. \n    The second cat meowed two (2) times the frequency of the first cat. \n    The third cat meowed at a one-third the frequency the second cat (1/3 = 1/4 = 0.75). (0.75 = meow 5.5 mins in 7.5 mins) \n\n3. The frequency of meows for each cat was given as: \n    First cat meowed three times in per minute. (meowing rate = 3 times per minute)\n    Second cat meowed two times the rate of the first cat (3 x 2 = 6 meows in 1 minute = 6 meows (per min) or 60 meows (in 10 mins) )\n    Third cat meowed at the rate of one-third (1/3 =1/4 = 1/5 = 0.8 = 0.8 x 3 = 2.4 meows per minute). (2.4 meows in 10 mins = 24 meows )\n\n4. Thus, in 10 mns( 0.75 minutes per one time for one cat to meow) the total number of meows by all the cats = 79 meows. \n5. So, to know how many meows the cats made in 5 mins (30 mns) the total meows is to be multiplied be 30 mns, then divided by 10 mns (3 time meow/time x 30 mns = 90 meows, 90 / 10 = 9 mns ) then the total meows for 5 mins = 88 meows. \n6.

How many fish are there below the surface?\nRationales: The given situation consists of two groups of goldfish, where one group is visible above the surface while the other is hidden below it. We are asked to determine how many of these goldfish are below the surface.\nTo start, we can assume that \"2% of goldfish are above the surface\" since 25% of the goldfish are visible, leaving 75% beneath the surface.\n\nBased on this, we can calculate the number of goldfish below the surface as follows: (0.75 x 15) = 11.25.\n\nThus, we can conclude that there are five goldfish beneath the surface.\n### Reasoning\nStarting with the first assumption, the visible goldfish above the surface is represented by 15,  so the total number of goldfish is 15+11.25=26.25, which is close to our answer of five goldfish below the surface.\n\nTo summarize, our response is: \"to arrive at the answer, we made the following assumptions: 2% of goldfish above the surface and 75% of fish below the surface\".\nWe then used these assumptions to calculate the total number of gold fish, which is a close match to the actual answer given in the question.", "answer": " 45"}

You don't actually know about the type and accuracy of the tools that the service provider uses. You don't have information about the user's expectations and the service provider's standards and capabilities. You don't know how the work was done (a quick shove back into the old state versus something more thorough), and the exact state of the old configuration prior to the work (was it unstable? broken? only loosely known?).\n\nAnd because this is general, almost everyone is going to provide you with some sort of generic and useless piece of advice, like \"it depends\", or \"that's too hard to estimate\", or \"it's impossible in a short answer\".\n\nInstead, be more specific about the type of data, the details of the tasks, and the general constraints of the system.

{"text": "880 points\n\n### Rationale:\n\n#### Input\nIn analyzing the question, we observe that it involves two main processes: computing touchdown points and computing total points.\n\nWe start by looking at option A: 4 touchdowns. This is definitely true given the context. There is an expression of 4 touchdowns scored per game, which matches the context given.\n\nNext, with the use of the expression 'touchdown is worth 6', we can interpret that there are 4 touchdown points for each game.\n\nThe context for 300 points is also valid. The expression 'old record was 301 touchdowns during the season' is a valid statement.\n\nA good indicator for the correct answer choice in the case of \"old record was 360 points during the season\" is 8+8, which corresponds to the 8+8 placement of options C through F.\n\n#### Response\nWe can find the answer by going through the logic below:\n\n\\$\\text{4 Touchdowns} \\Rightarrow \\text{4 \\* 6:}\\$ 4 points\n\n\\$\\xrightarrow{\\text{2 point conversions:}}\\text{4 Touchdown 2 Conversion}:$ 2+4+4 point Conversion 1 time for entire season, 8 points 1 time in the season\n\nAs we see, the final answer is 880 points.\n\n### Input\nIn analyzing this question, we observe the following.\n\n1. There is an explicit mention of 'how things went wrong'. Given this, the expression 'bad things and why they happened' does not hold contextual relevance.\n2. The expression 'a long and difficult night' could be interpreted as a bad thing because 'difficult' is a descriptive element generally associated with 'bad' or 'negative' connotations in expression.\n3. 'Bad things and what made them happened' is an ambiguous phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways as it's vague.\n4. The expression of 'difficult night can be interpreted as a sequence of events or context, but it cannot be interpreted as a bad outcome or occurrence. 5. Thus, option D: bad things and what made them happen is the correct answer as this phrase corresponds most closely to the context of the questions.\n\n###", "answer": " 72"}

He starts with 50 pills, which is enough for 12 days of 4-pill servings.\n3. After two days, he's already eaten through almost half of his pills.

For example, this means that there are no costs involved in taking out or refinancing a loan. This can signify the lack of fees such as origination fees or early repayment charges. \nWe need to identify which part of the sentence that is most likely to change from an interest-free loan to a non-interest loan. \n\nOne possible issue is that now a fee or a charge of some kind has been implemented for the loan. \nWe also need to consider the time. There will be a fixed date when the loan will be paid off. \nWe are left with the word \"year\" and \"month\".\n\n### Input\n### One and a half years and three days ago a man got a new loan. It is interest-free for six months.

After losing 1/4, one loses 8 small diaries from the 16 small diaries remaining. That gives us: 16-8=8 left. \n3) The number of diaries that Natalie's sister lost is 2/4, which means that 1/2 of these will be lost. That leads us to: `2/4`\u00d78=8, and 8 diaries were lost.\n4) Then, from the formula, Natalie's sister will have 39 diaries left (8 s - (2/4 s) = 39).\n\n---\n\n### Response \nGiven: 15 minutes to play for a game of 4D 7R\n### Rational: The first game was to determine the number of minutes they each had to play.

{"text": "He can make 13 coats (A)\n\n### Demonsration:\nThe question presents a scenario in which a person, Andy, acquires 30 minks for an unknown purpose and subsequently releases half of them. The question then asks for the number of coats that Andy can make using the 30 minks he initially had.\n\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the number of baby mink that will be born from each of the 30 mink Andy had. We also need to account for the number of mink babies that were subsequently set free by activists to solve for how many coats can be made. \n\nWe can calculate the baby mink number as follows:\n\n30 Minks x 6 Baby Mink/Mink = 180 Baby Mink.\n\nSo, we can infer that each of the 3o minks had 180 baby minks, which makes a total number of mink babi s as 540 (30x180).\n\nFrom there, we can divide a number of mink babbies that were set free by activists as indicated by the question, but it is not mentioned how much of them (in percent) were released. Let's assume that the percentage is 50% to simplify the scenario for the moment. We can then use the known mink release number percentage as well as the known total mink babi s number to compute the remaining mink babies:\n\n540/200 x 50% = 320\n\nTherefore, we can calculate the total number of coats produced:\n\n30 x 320 = 9600 coats.\n\nTherefore, Andy can make a total of 9600 mink coats, each with a value of 15 Mink Skins (9600 x 15 = 144000).\n\nFrom this solution, there are 3 things to consider when making guesses to an assessment:\n\n1.

{"text": "How many pregnant cows (pregnant females) are there?\n### Rationales: \n1. The question asks specifically about Terez's farm and how many pregnant female (pregnant) cows he has.\n2. The first part tells us that he has a total of 44 cows (male and female) while the second part tells us about the gender composition and pregnancy status of the cows on Terez's  farm. \n3. We can see that the word 'percent' and 'percentage' is being used to represent the percentages in this question (which means 50% are female and 50% are pregnant). \n4. Since we are asked about the number of pregnant female cats and not about the total number of female cats, the total number of cats can be eliminated.\n5. From the data given, we can interpret that 44 of the total 44 cows are the cows on Terek's farm and it means that the entire farm is consisted of 44 cats(44 cows).\n6. After understanding this information, we can conclude that 44 are pregnant female cros (44*2/44), where 2 is the total number of female pregnant cows.\n7.

Choices: A 13 B: 13 C: 61 D: 240 E: 349\nRationales:1. The question asks how long Lulu would have to read 269 pages to finish the entire book.\n2. Start by evaluating Rene's reading rate of 13 pages per 30 minutes. For Lulu, this suggests that if her speed is half that of Rene's, she'd be finished in 18 minutes.\n3. Next, let us analyze 'Lulu's book is about' meaning. For a 269 pages book, it is divided into 240 pages. Therefore, we have been considering the book as 240 pages (12 pages per 10 minutes).\n4. Then we can say that one hour needs to read 24 pages.\n5. So, Lulu will need to complete her reading in 240 pages in half an hour.\n6. We apply the same approach for the choices given.\n7.

His degree in science was for his science major, not to become an astronaut, and was completed in only 4 years, not 8 years as stated in the statement. The total number of years he spends pursuing his astronaut profession (including college and graduate degrees) is not yet the number of years we need, to arrive at the correct answer, we need to evaluate all additional time spent completing the other 2 degrees and the graduate degree.\n6 & 7. To calculate Tony's total education days, we can subtract the days taken for his science major and graduate physics degree from 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 days from 2 + 8 (days taken for his second and third degrees) = 28 + 4 + 2 = 34.

Here is a way to do it: To make the number less than 6 (GCD), we need to multiply it by 9/6 so the number is 1/2 away from 6.\n2. If the number we are thinking of is: 121311 we need to multiply it with 9/6 to get 121300 => 1/2 is away from 6, so 1-2-13-11 is 40. If we want to divide it by 6 to get 5 digits we get 7, and if we move 2 from the last digit we get 5 as our answer.\n3. Since GCD of a number and 6 is 1/2 it is obvious that that number will be GCD of 1 and 6, so the GCD will be 9.\n4.

Analyze the phrase, 'Every hour on the hour', which signifies a repeating occurrence that occurs at each hour of the clock.\n2. The main function of a clock is to tell time by indicating current time or time at particular intervals.\n3. Therefore to identify the options which will match the usage of a clock, consider each option individually and assess if it matches the context.\n4. Option 1: every hour of the hour can be plausible as the title 'Every hour on the Hour' can be understood in the way that each time of hour indicates the time of the hour, so this option is discarded.\n5. Option 2: At each hour of the hour is correct because it directly indicates the time of the clock every hour so this option is correct.\n6. Option 3: Around hour is discarded because the phrase 'around hour' can be understood as the time which is almost around the start of the hour so option 3 is incorrect.\n7. Option 4: At around each hour is discarded similar to option 3 because it doesn't directly indicate time but time which is almost around an hour. \n8. Option 5: At each time of day is incorrect because it doesn't represent a time of the day at a particular interval of time i.e. every hour. Hence, Option 5 is incorrect.\n9. Hence, the final option is at each hour of the hour.\nAnswer: 2: at each hour of the day\n\n### Input : What do toy company make when sunglass industry fails?

{"text": "The question posed in this question is \"How many days will it take for one amoeba (in the singular) to divide into 10 amoebae\".\n\nTo solve this problem, we must first understand that the rate of amoebae reproduction is constant for a given amoeba, which means that every two days it will always split into two amoebae (or into one amoeba and one amoeba). Let A(0) represent the number of amoebae at time t=0. Let A(t) represent the population of amoebae after t days. In general the population of amoobae A(t) in a given time t is described by the following recursive equation:\n\n\\[A(t) = 2A(t-2) - A(t-1)\\] \n\nThis equation has A(t) as our answer, A(t-1) as the prior amoebae population, and A(t-2) as the prior time population.\n\nSolving this equation via factoring yields:\n\n\\[2A = A - \\frac{1}{4}\\]\n\nThis is simply a quadratic equation with respect to A, which can be further converted to a linear equation by solving for A in terms of time. Plugging in the constants yields:\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{2}\\cdot e^{-t}} \\]\n\nWhich is a single parameter exponential growth function with respect to time, \\(e^{-t}\\). We can then plug in our starting value of \\(1\\) and solve for \\(t\\). This yields a final answer of \\(6\\) days.\n\nIt is important to recognize that a change of perspective of the question can lead to a different interpretation of the problem. For example, the question can still be interpreted as being about the population of one amoebae that happens to be split into 16 amobae. In this case, the answer would be the same since the division of one amoebea into 16 still needs the same number of population growths before it can eventually exceed 16.\n\n### Input & Rationales:\nInput: They were always trying to figure out how the world worked together, they were what kind of physicists?

An album is usually a collection of photographs, songs, and other media. Since the album can have different contents from images, music, and movies, it's plausable that the album can be stored anywhere and on any objects where it can be safely placed and protected from damage. A desk, fridge, shelf, etc. would all be acceptable as storage locations for an album.\n\n2. Consider each possible option thoroughly. Choices:\n\n* A: Shelf (option 1) \u2013 A shelf is a flat horizontal surface, with or without a support, intended to support objects placed on it.\n* B: own bedroom (option 2) \u2013 a bedroom is a private room where a person sleeps. As such, a bedroom would not be acceptable as an option for storing an album because the room might not be accessible or available for storage.\n* C: Desk (option 3) \u2013 A desk is a piece of furniture with a flat surface used for various activities such as reading, writing, and working.\n* D: Wall (option 4) \u2013 A wall is a typically solid structure that generally attaches to the exterior surface of a building. A wall is too rigid to be used as a container and would therefore not be a suitable storage option for an album.\n* E: Car (option 5) \u2013 A car is a wheeled vehicle designed to run on roads. A car is not an acceptable storage location for an album because it lacks a flat surface and the contents of the album could be damaged by the movement of the vehicle on the road.\n* F: Fridge (option 6) \u2013 A fridge is a refrigeration system to preserve food or drinks by cooling them.

{"text": "The answer is (176/3*4 + 120/5)(5/4)\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Tom decides to renovate the house. The task requires the breakdown of the total time into each section of the house individually.\nOptions: The task in question involves the assignment of a fixed duration to each room and the kitchen, using the information provided.\n\n\nThe kitchen: The kitchen takes 5/6 times the duration of each room, as per the information provided (50% longer than the time it actually takes to renovate each bedroom). For example, renovating 1 bedroom takes Tom 4 hours. However, it will take 5 hours to renovate the same bedroom if the kitchen is also taken into account. 5/6 is a rational value that results in the kitchen taking 50% longer as it does not include the 5 hours for the kitchen. 50/6 is the final required value that gives the kitchen 5/6 times longer.\n\n\nThe living room: The living room, on the other hand, took twice as long as everything else (including the kitchen) combined. Therefore, it takes twice as long as 1 bedroom. The total time for 3 bedrooms is 12 hours. The kitchen would take another 5 hours. Therefore, the living room would be 6/5th of that entire value. The total duration is [2/5 * (12/1) + 6/5]\n\n\nAnswer: Final calculation for all together. The living room takes 4/5th of 5/4. Multiply that by the whole duration of the bedrooms plus the kitchen (123/5) and we get 176/3 * 4 as result. As per the math shown, the final result is 176/20 hours or 176/4 hours.\n\n### Input :Alice was an aspiring young singer who auditioned for American Idol in 257.

{"text": "The correct answer is A: \n\n### Rationale:\nLet's start with A: 84 rolls. Since each car seats 2 and there are 84 people, the first few cars are going to be full.\u00a0 The ride operator then has to run the rollercoaster 14 more times to get the last car and everyone to the first car.\u00a0 The answer will be the total number of ways the operator has to run the rollersercoaster, so this number is 84, plus this number, plus this number, etc. \u00a0Add together all of these numbers since every time the rider stops, the person who is still riding needs to start over.\u00a0 Each time they go around on the rollercoaster, this person goes 1/2 around the track, which is 32 rotations in total. \u00a0The next rider needs to also ride 32 rotations.\u00a0 After the last rider, everyone has to ride 40 rotations to get back to their starting seat. \u00a0So, the total number of rotations that need to be done is 84 rotations plus 14 rotations plus 24 rotations plus 32 rotations plus 16 rotations plus 12 rotations plus 3 rotations. \u00a0That's 84 rotations with 10 extra rotations, for a total of 94 rotations needed to get everyone on board the ride.\n\n### Input and Response:\n\nInput: A math exam was canceled.\u00a0 When a student asked the teacher why, he replied, \"It was too good.\u00a0 No one would have been able to pass\"\n\nRationale: The teacher can't be saying the test was too hard because if the exam was too hard, then not one person could have passed.\u00a0 This would make the exam a complete failure.\u00a0 But we know that a student asked why the exam was canceled, which proves that at least one person passed.\n\nAnswer: B.\n\n### Inspections made by the manufacturer:\n\n### A.\u00a0 Each of the bolts that hold these units together are tested before being put into the units\n\nRationale:\u00a0 Since the bolts are in more than one place, we can't say it's a defect.\n\n### B.\u00a0 Each of the light", "answer": " 6"}

Start by considering option A: multiple of 12. Let's take 12 as the base since it's in the options. For an integer to be a multiple of 12, its divisible by 12. A divisor is a number that can divide to be equal to the other. For example, a number is divisible by 2 if it can be divided to be equal to the number 2. A multiple of 12 is a value that can be divided by 12 without a remainder. So, the divisor for a multiple of 14 is 12.\n2.

A1 and D1 match because Hawkeye charges 4 times, Hawkeye uses $7 when he charged his battery. This option is incorrect.\n2. B1, C1, E1 do not meet the condition of driving to his aunt because he only charges his battery 3 times in his workshop. These options are false\n3. Hawkeye has $14 in his pocket and he needs to charge his battery for 3 times. Therefore, Hawkeye bought a battery for $4. This means that option D is completely wrong.\n4. Therefore the true answer is A2\nAnswer: A2: Hawkeye is driven to an aunt and Hawkeye has a problem charging a battery because it is his work. Therefore, his aunt had 7 dollars to charge a dead battery because Hawkeye spent 3 times to charge his battery. After Hawkeye charged his battery by 3 times, his battery was charged as the battery was dead to the maximum. Therefore, Hawkeyes aunt provided $5.5 to Hawkeye to solve a battery problem. Therefore, this means that the battery was dead to 7 dollars and 950 mAH battery will be changed with 7 dollars. He could charge his battery by 3 dollars. Therefore, the question is: Hawkeye is traveling to an aunt and has a 950 mh battery and the battery is dead to 7. Therefore, the answer is Hawkeye has a 95 mh battery to change after changing the battery, he could charge his battery by $3. So Hawkeye was given $5.5 by Hawkeye's aunt because Hawkeye had to travel to an aunt.\n\n### Input Hawkeye is driving his aunt", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The answer is D.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. In this problem, the flowerbed is a rectangle whose width is four meters and the length is one meter less than twice that width.\n2. If we write this flowerbed in the form `W \u00d7 (2W - W) = L`, it can be seen that the length `L` is given by `L` = `(2W) - W` meters.\n3. Given this flowerbed, the government wants to fence it. This means that it wants to use `T` meters of fence.\n4. Because the flowerbed is a square, we can say that the area of the flowerbed (`A`) equals `4 m \u00d7 2(2 m - 4 m) = 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 2 = 16 m2`.\n5. So, the ratio `A:T` is equal to `16:T` and `16/T = 4`. We know that the value T, which is the total number of meters of fence, needs to be equal to the square root of `16/4`, which equals `4 m`, and that square of `4` is `16`.\n6. So, `4m \u00d7 4m = 16m2`.\n7. We also know that a square is a rectangle and that the width and length of the flowerbed are given. So we can write the area of this flowerbed as `4A = 4(4 W \u00d7 (2W - 4W) = 16W`, and the length `L` as `2W`.\n8. So, the area of the flower-bed is `16 W` and the length of the fence is `(2W - 4 W) = 2 W`.\n9. Therefore the answer is `Ans: D: 16`.", "answer": " 22"}

Usually, there is a nurse who is present in the recovery room to assist the patient and offer support. One of their primary duties is to provide medication to help the patient recover more quickly.\n4. Therefore option E: Medication is the correct answer. 4. Option A: takes the IV out of the patient refers to medication that's administered through an IV during the operation but it's not used after the operation, so it is not the correct answer.\n5. Option c : fills out medical paperwork doesn't directly answer what the nurse did after the operation. The patient won't be filling out any paperwork after the operation which is what is required in the question. \n6.

So next she tears each of the two slices in half. Two, 2 is a number she has already used and so the next half of both halves of the pieces is left of 1. So Melonaia uses 1 in addition.

So, if the distance traveled is 1800, we get   =   = 240 gallons\n\nStep 3:\nNext, consider the number of bags for each passenger as each person is required to carry at least 2 bags and a crew of 5 means they will carry 10 bags total. \nSo, the total gas consumption including all the bags equals   =   = 300 gallons. \nHence, the total gas consumption needed for a 40-hour (4-hour journey) journey is 100 + 240 + 300 = 640 gallons.\nNote: This is the general solution for solving the given problem.

Then, move to option B: 'Plane'. The other choices are animals but planes fly.\n3. Now it looks like either option C or D are the correct choices.\n4.

To work out the answer, first we need to analyze Samson's intake.\n3. We can see that he ate 3 sandwhiches (1 for lunch, 2 for dinner). We also know that he ate half as many sandwiches at dinner as he did for lunch (because he thought he ate twice as many sandwiches overall, meaning he thought he ate 6 sandwiches at dinner).\n4. This works out to a total of 5 sandwiches (3 lunch, 2 dinner).\n5. He woke up on Tuesday and ate 1 sandwich. This means he ate no sandwiches overall for dinner and consumed 4 sandwiches total.\n6.

{"text": "39\n\nThe statement presents a context where there are 74 apples at the beginning of the day. Ricki takes out 14 of them, and Samson takes out twice as many as Rickin which is 28 apples. This means that Ricki took half of the apples and Samson took only one third of them.\n\nThe question asks about how many apples are left by the end of the 1 day. One of the remaining 32 apples is still in the basket at the beginning of the second day. We can therefore calculate that 31 apples or 43% are left in the basket. This is equivalent to the number of apples taken out.\n\nSince Ricki and Samson did not take any apples simultaneously, the day must have passed in between, so all the apples in the basket can be inferred to have been taken out by the end of the second day.\n\n### Input:\"The people started to protest against the new rule.

Choices: 1. 1/2 foot 2.17 foot 3. 1/6 foot 4. 1/4 foot 5. 1/2 yard\nRationales:\n    1. We start by understanding the question. Looking at the context, it is a question about the possible ways to measure length. In the question, it is suggested that you can only use 1/2 foot, 1/4 foot, or 1/6 foot.\n    2. In the question, the phrasing \"1/6 foot\" is ambiguous as to whether it is referring to 1/6 foot or 1/3 foot since it can be construed as 1/6 foot, 1/2 foot and 1/3 foot.\n    3. Therefore, this phrasing can be interpreted as 1/3 foot, so the options are 1/3 foot foot and 1/2 foot.\n    4. Keeping this in mind, we can eliminate option A: 1/2 foot as it makes a sense of fullness based on half length and is not in line with the context of the problem.\n    5. Also, eliminating options B and C: 1/4 foot and 1/6 foot respectively as they are already part of the phrase mentioned and have been eliminated.\n    6.

{"text": "While cultivating their farm a farmer spent __% of their income on __ % of total production and __ % of their production on __% of total costs. From that information the farmer could use the ratio __ % to __ % to calculate the __ % of farm profit.\n\n### Input Analysis: Calculate farm profit using a 10% profit margin.\n\n### Solution:\nThis solution shows how a 10% farm profit can be calculated given the data of what a farmer spent on seeds, fertilizers, and labor.\n\nThe statement mentions that the farmer spent 50% of their income on the corn seeds, 35% on fertilizers and 15% on labor. \n\nTherefore, the farmer cultivated a farm profit and profit margins from this were as follows:\n\n1. Total production = 10 bags, that's 1000 kg in 1 bag. \n\n2. Total costs = 35 + 25 + 10 = 70 kg. We can't use these percentages as farm profit without any reference to total income, so we'll use a ratio.\n   \n3. Farm profit = 10 - 7 = 3 kg\n\n4. Profit margin = 3%\n\n5. Using this, we can calculate farm profit by multiplying the profit margin with income and then profits:\n  \nProfit = (3 / 100) * 50 = $1.5 ( \u2248 \u20b9 10)\n\nAs 5% of total production cost is profit margin (35 kg) x 3 = 105 kg.\n\n   3% of that is profit = 105 x 3/ 100 = 105 * 3 / 10 = 3.2 kg.\n\n   0% of total production cost that is profit margin(35 / 100 =.35) x 10 = 0.35 kg.\n\n### Output Analysis: Given the calculation, the correct answer is option A. 105 kg of corn seeds can be sold for a $1500 profit at a price of $160/kg. \n\n## Explanation\n\nThis", "answer": " 11"}

If we have 100 points we had 10 rounds played with 60 points each yielding 600.\n   4.

Calculate and write the answer in the following format: Answer \u2248 ________.\n\nStep 3. Solve the equation in the answer calculation above.\n\n#### Notes:\n1. Don't use numbers for variable names.\n1. Use a variable name to represent different things, not to use as a replacement for the thing itself. Example: John = Joe, Peter, Bob,...\n2. Don't use a variable name that is ambiguous or misleading. Variables need to be named in a way that will make the solving easier to do.\n3. Choose a variable to use that is already a known quantity. For example, if you need to find the area of a square where the length of the side is 2, choose x (read as \"x\") as the variable.\n3. Use the letters a, b, or c to use as variable names. \n4. In an equation, both sides of the equation must be equal. So before solving any equation, make sure that it is balanced.\n5. Once the equation is balanced, make sure that all the variables are in the same form in both sides \n6. It is always better to simplify as much as possible. \n7. If you need to use negative numbers, add a negative sign to the variable without moving it from its place.\n8. If you need to combine like terms in a variable, use parentheses and multiply the numerator and denominator by the coefficient. That way, it won't affect the solution.\n9. If you can't remove brackets or parenthesis when you do the calculations, write the equations with brackets. It will be easier when you solve the equation.\n10. Whenever possible, reduce variables to the simplest form. Example: x x x + x +2 = 4\n11. Inverse operations do not affect the variables' value. For example, in 10 x 2 \u00f7 2 = 30, the division operation did not change the value of x. \n12. When you need to find the square root, use x as the variable.

{"text": "Julia was born in 2012.\n\n### Rationale: First, we eliminate all of the options except for option C because it is simply a duplicate of other options. Furthermore, we can see for ourselves that Julia cannot be born any number of years before Peter because his age already exceeds her maximum threshold of 2 years older than him. Next, we examine the equations to determine which one applies to Julia. For option B and C, we already knew that Peter was 35 years old in 2019. Using that information, we can know for certain that Julia was 29 years old in 2o19. We can then use that information when we have Peter's age now for option D as well. This allows us to know that Julia's age in 2016 is 25 and that she is 3 years older that Peter which is 28. This means that Julia's age now is 30 which is when option D works because she is 29 + 3 and 29 + 2, and thus her birth year could 2012, 2013, or 2014.\n\n### Input:\"Josiah\" \"Josiah\" \"The King of the United States\" \"King Josiah\"\n\nAnswer: Josiah.\n\n### Explaination: We know that option C must be wrong for two reasons. One, from the context of \"King Josiah,\" We know that Josiah's age cannot be 90 or 91, as this would clearly be an absurdity. We also know it cannot be 92 or 93, as option D states and thus option C would be logically impossible. From the fact that option C cannot be true, it must therefore be false. Thus, we consider the remaining three possible answers. Option A cannot be true because there is no name that ends in \"Syah\" so we can automatically dismiss it. Option B is not true because according to option D, Josiah's name does not end with an \"h\" so option a must be false. Finally, we are left with option E which states that he is the king. The rest of the sentence confirms that he is the king, so we can thus conclude that Josiah is definitely the king.\n\n### Task:The word \"lunatic", "answer": " 1979"}

{"text": "The correct response is A: 49 bolts and 78 nuts.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nStart with each group. Each box of bolts had 11 per box, while each box of nuts had 3 per box. As a result, there were 78 and 54 nuts and bolts respectively. When we add the two together, we get a total of 132 (bolts plus nuts). We also know that 3 x 4 + 12 = 6. Therefore, we get 6 total extra bolts and 6 total extra nuts. This indicates the project had 132 total bolts and nuts.\n\nThis means that he needs 3 x (number of total bolts) for the project, which equals 3 x 132 = 396 nuts.

{"text": "The correct answer for this question is option A: 1047.\n\n### Rational:\nThe given question can be understood as follows:\nAisha enjoyed listening to music through her mp3 player, and she had a base of 500 songs. She added another 500 songs the week after that, which amounted to a total of 1000 songs on her player. Then she realized that her player had a large capacity for storing more songs, so she decided to double the total number of songs. \n\nHowever, she decided that she didn't like some of the songs, so she removed 50 of them. This means that after removing the 50 songs, she had 1000 - 50 = 950 songs on her player altogether. But then she decided to add another 2000 mp3 songs, which amounted to 2500 songs in total.\n\nThis brings the total number of mp3 songs on the player to 50 + 2500 + 1000 = 2650. By removing 50 of the mp3 songs from the collection of 2650, it's evident that she now has 2650 - 50 which equates to 2600 mp3s altogether.\nTherefore, the correct answer for the question is 2600, as indicated by option A in the choices.\n\n### Tips & Tricks\n-The question would involve applying logic, subtracting the wrong answer, and choosing the remainder\n-Involves subtraction and number manipulation to subtract wrong answer and determine remainder.\n-Remember to check whether the question involves 'A' or 'B' statements and apply the right techniques, such as using multiplication to get the correct answer if the question is 'B'.\n\n### Example\n\n### TLC: Transcription Linguistics Competition.\n\nThe 45th edition of Transcription Linguistics\u2019 (TLC) Annual Conference will be held at the George Washington University, WDC from June 26th through the 29th, 2023 (http://tlc.georgetown.edu).

The first step is to consider the cost of each ticket for a total of $48.\n2. Then, we determine how much Mr. Benson paid for every ticket that is above 10 tickets:\n    A. Mr. Benson paid the cost of those tickets PLUS an additional 5% discount = ($48 x 1.05)  OR $4.90\n3. Total it up to get the grand total: $48 + ($48 x 0.05) = $56.60\n4. Next, to determine how much Mr.Benson paid, we subtract the discount percentage from 100%, which gives us 53.4% remaining.\n5. Multiply this % by the $56.6 to get the answer.\n6. Since a % of 53.4 corresponds to $\\frac{56.6}{100}$, it is equal to $56.6 * \\frac{53.4}{100} = 53.4 = $53.4 = $$88.5\n\n### Demostration:\nCost of each ticket: $48\n\n$ 5% off for 10 or more tickets: $4.90 per extra ticket\n\n$48 x 12 = $ 56.60 $56.6 plus $4.9 = $61.5 The answer is $88.5.", "answer": " 476"}

Choices: A: bag B: suitcase C: box D: envelope E: bundle\nRationales:1. The prompt presents a situation wherein a car pulls up and the boy, who we'll call 'Willy' in this case, opens the door and receives something from the car driver.\n2. Based on these details, there are various possible interpretations and scenarios, but there's one element that stands out - the fact that \u2018Willy' opened the door is crucial for the question to make sense.\n3. For this reason, we discard all options other than opening the door as an action that could have occurred.\n4. The phrase 'the driver quickly handed him [Willy] what?' presents us with two more important elements: the object that was handed to Willy and the way in which it was handed to him [quickly]. \n5. There are generally four possibilities for the object based on the descriptions: bag, suitcase, box, or bundle.\n6. We also need to consider how the car driver handed the object to Willy.\n7. The word option C: \"box\" can be considered as it's an object that could be easily handed, and it would be logical for the car driver to give the box to Willy directly if he's carrying out some errands or running some chores for Willy.\n8. However, we discard this option due to the additional constraint of the car driver handing it 'quickly', since there's no logical reason for a car driver to hand the box quickly if it's on their seat.\n9.

{"text": "Let x represent the number of sales in the stationery section and f, the fabric section, and j, jewelry section. We know that |x| + |f| + |j| = 36 and |x| + 2|f| + 3|j| + 1(total number of sales) must be equal to 72. We also know (x+f+j) = |x| + |j| + |f|, so 3x + 2f+3j = 36. Therefore, |x| + |x+f| + |x+j+f| + |f+j| = 3x + 3(f + j), so |x| + (2x+ f + j) + (x + f + f + j) + 2(f + j) = 36. Dividing by 2, we get |x| + (x+f+f+j) + 2(F +j) = 18, so |x| + x + (x+j+f) = 18. Subtracting, we get |x-x| = 18-1 = 17. Therefore, x = 1, since |x| represents the total number of sales in the section, as mentioned above. Therefore, in our initial statement, f = 9 and total sales = 27. In our formula, x = 1 so we get: |x| + (9 + 9) + 2(9 + 9) = 18 which simplifies: x + 18 = 18, therefore, x = 1.

We can understand that Henry took 9 pills every day, which equals to 9*8=72 pills.\n2. From there, we can infer that each pill costs $10.2 and Henry's total daily spend for pills is $72.\n3. This gives us the formula for calculating total daily spends: $72*6= $432.\n4. The question asks us to know how much Henry spent on medication, but we must determine from the wording the specific category of medication that Henry spent on: the pills in question.\n5. The first part of the question clearly establishes the category of medication that is the focus ($10.20).\n6. Based on this, we can infer that Henry spent $432 on medication, not $72 for pills as we first assumed ($432*72 = $31,384).\n7. Henry spent $43.20 on medication, which equates to $432.00 over 10 doses.\n8. Henry spent $46.40 on medication, so his daily spend should come to $46.4/$2.31 for 42 days or more than $190.\n9.

As this question is multiple choice, you know that only 2 of the options will be odd, which is why you'll get rid of Option B in step #1 (450, which means that we can't multiple it by 20). After multiplying 20 times 100 gr., you end up with 27 grams (20 x 100), which is what you get in Option C (27,000 gr.), except for a factor of 100 (which we multiply by so we get 27 grams). After dividing 27 by 100, we get 0.27 grams (which is 270), which is what we get in the final step, Option D (37,500 gr.).

Considering choice A:  she searched her room for change,  this implies that she was not simply looking for the money that she already had in the piggy bank.\n3. Considering choice B:  $450 in coins was taken out of the bank,  this means that for all four years, money was put in the bank.\n4. Considering choice C:  $160 was put in the piggy  bank in the first year, it means that while the previous amount was doubled the  following year, the original amount from the initial year could not have been put in again given that it is gone. \n5.

{"text": "35 more employees drive to work rather than take public transportation.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe answer is A, which is incorrect. To determine the count of employees, we sum the percentage and subtract 1 from the total, since there is 100% of people driving to work and an additional 60% people who drive to work. That gives a total of 160 people and a total of 60 people who don't drive, sum which are then subtracted in the question to find the count. \n\nFor example, if the percentages add up to 75% and there are 80 cars, you would add 80 to 75% to achieve 58.75. Then, you would subtract 60 and get that 8.75% of people drove to work and the remainder 58.7. \n\n\n### Input; What happened when the driver of the car went to get his lunch?

Choices: \nA: winter B: fall C: spring D: summer E: autumn\nRationales:1. This question requires an understanding of the definitions and phases of the year, as well as the use of logic to determine a plausible answer. \n\n2. 'The summer that follows' means the season that follows in the subsequent year. This could be any season, particularly after summer, given that summer is a season on its own, and the weather stays the same. However, if the weather stayed exactly same after the summer, then there would be no change in the climate, i.e., the season would remain the same, and the same season would then not end and will remain like that even in the subsequent year.\n\n3. Hence, given the context, it is plausible to say that the season that comes next, if the weather stays exactly the same, will be \"spring\".\n\n4. Spring is a season that follows winter (the season that comes next after winter if the weather changed) as well as the final phase of winter if the weather stayed the same. \n\n5. Therefore, given that the answer can either be of the type of season that comes next year (which is autumn) or the final phase of the season in the present year (which is spring), as long as the condition mentioned in 2 is satisfied, the answer would be spring.\n\nAnswer: Spring\n\n### Grading: Your results are graded according to the following rubric:\n\n##### Example:\nInput: The person probably left to watch their favorite show of the month.\nOptions: A: Went to the store B: Watched the news C: Went to the dentist\n\nRationales:\nStart by considering each possible choice.\n\nA: Went to the Store: It's unlikely that the character would have gone to the store, as that wouldn't make sense because the sentence only mentions that they left, not specifically where they left to.\n\nB: Watched the news: This action doesn't really make sense within", "answer": " 1000"}

So at lower setting, it vibrated ((-1/3600) > 850 times.\nNow we add the vibrations when it vibrates at the lowest setting:  vibrates(2) at lowest setting:  \n\n(850 + 2)x =  15/90 x = (6000 + 2)/(900 + 2) = 2700/92= 29.6\nFinal Answer: 29,600/180 = 162.222222\n\n### Output: The given massager has the speed of 162. 22 repeating and it buzzes by 1/30th of a second.

{"text": "Answer\nShe can make 46 scarves.\n### Justification:\nThe total number of scarves that she will make is determined by the formula: M = L * (N/M) where:\n* M is the number of scarves she can make with one yarn\n* L is the total number of yards she owns\n* N is the number of different colors that she owns\n\nIn this case, M = 3, L = 9, and N = 4.\nSince she can make 3 scarves with one yarn and she owns 9 yards, we can say that she can make 9 scarves from 1 yarn.\nSince she owns 4 different colors of yarn (Red, Blue, Yellow and Green) she can buy 33 scarves.\nBy dividing 33 by 4, we see that she can make 8.25 scarves from one each color.\nNext, we take the largest number: 8.25 and multiply it by 3.\nWe can write it this way: 8.24 * 3 = 25.04\nThere are a few ways to read this calculation:\n* You can multiply by the number of colors\n* You can multiply with how many she already bought\n* You can multiply the number of different colors by what she can make out of one color\n\nWe add the 3 yards (each in the 4 colors) that he bought in red yarn, and we can see that she can buy 9.63 scarves in red, blue, yellow and green yarn (8.25 * 3).\nSince he bought more red yarn (3) than she can make scarves (3), she can make 6 additional scarves (3 - 3 = 0, so 6 total red scarves she can make in that yarn).\nThe number of yellow scarf she can make is 4.\n\nWe add these numbers:\n```\nShe can buy 9.23 scarves out of a single yarn (8.54 * 3)\n* 6 additional scarves from the red yarn (3 - 3 *)\n* 4 additional scarves from the yellow yarn (4 * 1)\n* 13.23 * 3 = 39.", "answer": " 36"}

I\u2019d say that the pig is most likely a pet the woman is trying to transport to somewhere or taking off the leash, so it\u2019s more natural for her to lift it by its hooves than its leg/arm/tail.\n\n\n## Input:What was used to get the item to move?\n\nInput: Why didn\u2019t he just buy it for $8?\n\nRationales: The choice \u201cA: money\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense, because people usually just buy something if they want it, but I thought that in this specific case the person wanted to be polite and not just leave. However, when I look at the choice list, I think that \u201cA: money\u201d is a good idea, but then the choice list becomes inconsistent. Therefore, \u201cA: money\u201d isn\u2019t a good choice.\n\n### Input2:The man could only find enough coins to get a $50 item.

{"text": "A: 35 mph\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nThe speed of a race cannot be more than the fastest half the distance.\n\n1. Half of an hours worth of running = 30 minutes\n2. Therefore, (20 + 30) / 2 = 25\n\n### Inputs:\n\nThe problem description is ambiguous, because running \"half the distance in 30 minutes\" can also be interpreted as meaning running for 15 minutes, as well as running 10 minutes per kilometer.\n\nIn the latter case, we need to figure out how the author's claim (the 10K race) is derived from the two time measurements (20 min for 1st half & 30m for 2nd half).\n\nUsing the 2nd interpretation we get (taking the author's word) that TJ ran for 3 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nThe problem is that after we take our first measurement of 30 minutes, we then run for 30 minutes longer, so 60 minutes in total.\n\n### Answer Options:\n\nDuring those remaining 5 minutes we must have run an average of 10 km!\n\n\n### Input:\"While driving, my car is using a gallon of gas, so then I drive 100 miles.

(This latter unit is not mentioned as a possibility, unlike for oil barrel and wine barrel).\n\n100 miles is given as a mileage, 100 mi/gal/1000 L = 100, and 100/117 mi/imperial gallon = approximately 0.87 mpg.\n\n### Input\"Everyone has been using this gas can to fill up their cars, but some of the guys decided to have a few drinks and fell asleep.

Choices:  In the past decade, the average adult has increased in how much they are allergic to cats. In the past decade in the United States, the amount of people that are allergic to pets has increased. In the past de 5 decades, the percentage of people with allergies to dogs has stayed the same for children. The average American is allergic to pests that he or she used to be allergic to crabs. Allergies to cats have decreased in the last 15 years.\n\n### Rationales: 1) Starting with the first one: The \"In the past decade,...\" is a clause that starts off by referring to the decade of the 2000s, meaning the years 2001 to 2010. Therefore, 10 years have passed since then, so we can call this one the 2010s.\n2) Also the \"Average adult\" is referencing a group larger that just men and women. Since this is in the 2012s there are more adults in the population than 10 years prior, 10 years prior would be in the 2002s. So the average adult in 2001-2010 is a different than the average adult in 1991-2000 or 1981-1990, these are people who experienced different environments and differing amount of pollution, therefore it would be different than the average adult 2011-2020.\n3) When we consider the options about allergies having stayed the same, or having increased.

Given that there are three adults whose average weight equals 140 pounds, we have :\n\n```\n=3140/3 = 1040/1 < 1041/2 = 520< 600\n```\n\nThus, the average adult weight is equal to 520 pounds. We can reach to the conclusion by applying the same formula for children:\n\n```\n= 64/2 = 32 < 600\n\n```\n\nTherefore, the maximum weight of the children is 32 pounds. We can then apply the same formula on average weights for the children to find their average weight:\n\n```\n=(32/2) = 16\n```\n\nThese values are added to a similar formula for those of adults' average weights to reach the conclusion that the maximum weight of an adult passenger will be only 17 pounds.

We assume 26 weeks to calculate the first two options, and x weeks, when we do not know the duration, to calculate the next two options,\n\nWe can see that option E, where Sam saves 340 dollars after working for 26 weeks, has the shortest duration for him to meet the console payment, which is 8 weeks.

How many students are in the 2 grade class.\n\n### Response. There will always be 10 between classes in different grade levels. If this is true and there were 110 students In the 4th grade, with 100 students In the 3rd grade and with 100 in the 2nd. 110-100 is 10.  100-10 is 90. \n\n### There will be 10 people In 2nd grade and no 1st grade class because that does not happen if a class is eliminated, it is no longer happening so therefore there would be no 32 people in 32 grade and no 31st grade students because the grade would not be there any more.\n\n### Answer. There are 110 -10 = 100 students are in 4th grade.\n\n                                   There are 111- 10 -1 = 100 in 3", "answer": " 26"}

{"text": "Answer: 23\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales:  1. The question asks how many balloons they blow up and does not mention the total time or number of blows it took. So, we assume the time and number of blows are constant. After all, what matters is the end result of how many balloons he blows up.\n2. The problem is to determine which number of blows (N) resulted from a balance between blowing at her own speed or at double speed. The number 0 indicates no blows at all. There is no way 0 blows can result in 40. So, to solve this problem, we solve for N. To do this, we substitute in the appropriate values to produce the value of the balloons.\n3. 23 blows can be obtained if Kris blows 2 and her brother blows 3 at his double speed. This is the answer that makes the problem balance.\n\n\n### Demosition", "answer": " 240"}

{"text": "Michelangelo will have 8 ceilings left to paint after next weeks work.\n\nMichelangelo has painted 14 ceilings so far this week, but has 28 ceiling to repaint. Next week, we know from the word problem that Michelangelo will repaint 1/4 of the number of ceilinfgs that he painted this week. If we assume that Michelangelo can paint 2 ceilings a week, then we can derive two statements: Michelangelo will paint 2/5 ceilings left to repaint over next week and then Michelangelo will only have 4 ceilings left to re-paint. So, 1+1 means that Michelangelo will have 6 ceilings left to fully repaint. From the original word problem, you can see that Michelangelo has 25% of ceilings left unpainted and so he will have 25% of the ceilings left after another week (remember that we assume michelangelo can paint 12 ceilings a month) and so 27/7 = 1/3 which is equivalent to 50% of the ceilinfs left.\n\n### Answer:", "answer": " 13"}

Now the friend comes over, we fix the television, and I ask her, \"Did you notice anything interesting while I was trying to fix the television?\" She should respond, \"Oh yeah, it kept turning on and off every five minutes!\" She could say any one of the other options we saw earlier, but it's most likely to be option D: It keeps turning on and off every 5 minutes.

Let's say, I tell you I lost my phone while traveling and you ask me where I lost it. I can respond with four of the options that we saw earlier. Let's say the three choices I give you are A, It was in my hotel room. B I lost it somewhere in between the car rental and baggage claim. C I lost it in the train station and D I lost it somewhere between the train station and my hotel room. The most likely choice you can say here would be D: I lost it somewhere between car rental and hotel room. It's not only because it's the best answer, but because it has a structure we can recognize. It begins with a negative construction, saying I lost it, followed by some details describing some of the things that happened in that section.

{"text": "It would take her 25 hours to complete reading the 250-Page Book, assuming Grace can read the same for both.\n\nA similar solution to the above problem is to consider the inverse of the time taken to read a 20 page book using a rate which is 25 page per hour. Let $x$ denote the time taken to read the $200$ pages and $25x$ to read the $250$ pages. We can then assume that $x:250=20x$. \n\nThis implies that $x/20$ is the inverse of $25/x$. \n\nTaking the natural logarithm of both sides and simplifying, you get:\n\n$$\\begin{align} x/20 &= \\dfrac{1}{2}\\ln (25/x)\n\\\\ x/20 &= 15/x^2 + 1/5\n\\\\ e^x &= {5\\over x^2}+1\n\\\\ {x^2}e^x &= 5 + 1\n\\\\ x^2 = 5-e^{-x}\n\\\\ x = \\sqrt{5} - e^{-1}\n\\\\ x = 6.42\n\\end{align}$$\n\nNote that this number is the approximate reading rate of any page in any book, as it represents the approximate amount of time to read $1000$ words (i.e., a standard page) which is much more efficient than reading the actual book at the rate you started with. \n\nLetting $x=$ reading rate of $20000 $ words (i.e. average $1000 $ words per page), this approximation can be used to find out the approximate reading rate in other time frames.\n\nFor example, given that the average reading rate of $25000$ words is $33$minutes($1760$seconds).

Sabrina cuts each cookie into three thirds, leaving Sabrina as the person with the last 20 cookies, as her total cookie amount C\u2019 = x-3x/3= 0\n6. Sabrina gives 2/6 or 1/3 cookies to 1 brother giving x-6 cookies to sabrina and her brothers original C=x = 20\n7. For her Mom her total C \u2018= x-6=14, but her brothers new C\u2019 = x-6= 11\n8.

This is a smaller amount so you subtract 60 x 1 from 129:\n\n| 60 mins |  1,344 Liters | R - 129 Litters |\n\n4. You subtract 1,344 mins from the amount of time, which equals 0:00 (zero minutes).\n5. The only thing that remains is to multiply time by liters, which is 60 Liters x 60, leaving you with 3,600 Liters after the multiplication.\n6. Convert 3,601 Liters to Liters, which leaves you with 3,701 Liters, the minimum amount you need to fill a 130-liter tub. This process is accomplished by first finding the closest number to the total amount (4,840 Liters) and then adding its absolute value to the total amount. The result will be less than and/or equal to 60m, which is why you multiply by 60 to make the result.\n\n1. R + L (x) = 1,300 Liters (L)\n\n2. L (x) - R = 100 Liters (l)\n\n3.

We can assume these variables have their respective units, but for simplicity sake, let's simply call them 'tarantula legs', 'tarantulas', and 'tarantula egg sacs'.\n\n3. Determine missing information. Based on the data given, we know that one egg sac can contain 2 legs (because the tarantulas in the egg sacs have 2 legs each) and that if a tarantula has 8 legs then it also contains 1000 of the same 2-legged tarantulas (because 1 tarantula has 1000 legs, and each leg carries 2 tarantulas with 2 legs each). Since, we know that the legs in each tarantula are the same (1000 each), the number of legs will be equal for both the 1 and 2 legs. We also know the total number of baby tarantulas in the 5 egg sacs is the sum of legs in egg sacs (6887).\n\n4. Identify how the equation will operate. In order to solve for the missing information (how many baby tarantula 'legs' will be in one less than five eggsac), we need to be provided the number of baby tarantula legs in that lessened amount of egg sac.\n\n5. Solve the equation. The equation will be in the form of a fraction.\nThe number of baby tarantule legs in the one less than five egg sacks will be 1/5 - 1.

By calculating the actual nutritional breakdown of what she ate, we find the number totaling 3.6 ounces:\n```\n3.6/36 = 0.1\n```\nSince the FDA approved the recommended daily calorie intake to be 25 as the highest possible number for an adult, the 3.6-ounce sample of lunch represents 818% of the calories that she should be consuming in a day. The recommended calorie intake is the standardized guideline for dietitians and individuals looking to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. The FDA sets different calorie intake caps when it comes to age, activity level and weight. This allows dietitians to better suit a client\u2019s health needs as opposed to having one number that is universal for everyone. To conclude, while an ounce of lunch may not seem like much, over time that amount increases by 818% and could lead to unhealthy weight gain if it becomes a habit.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "We can assume that the speed is constant, regardless of hour.\n\nWe can also assume that the speed increases linearly with the increase in time.\n\nThe time required to complete a task is inversely proportional to the speed with which the task is performed.\n\nTo solve this problem, let the amount of pages he reads in the first hour, be x\n\nTo find x, we need to find how many pages are read in (t1 - 1) hours, so: `b1 = x + b1*(t1 - 1)` where b1 is the pages read in second hour after considering hour 1.\n\nTo find hours, we need to get amount of pages read in 2 hours considering hour 1, so: `b2 = 12*t2 + 3*t2 - 12*t1 + 3*t1`\n\nNow, using `t1*1` and `t2*1` in place of `t1` and `t1` respectively, the equation can be simplified to: `b1 + b2 = 15`\n\nFrom here, we can see that the value of b1(pages read in first hour considering t1) is the amount of page read in second hour if the speed is constant.\nThus, we can say that for 15 pages to be read, the number of hours required to complete it is 2.\n\nWe know that the hours needed to read a page is inversely proportional with the speed.\n\nSo we can write the equation as: `c(Pages/in hour) = d(Time/in second)` where a and b is the rate at which he can read the book.\n\nNow, this implies that the number of pages read can be found using: `pages_read = (hours*12)/hours2` \n\nWe can also write: `pages_read(hours) = c/d`\n\nTo find the required time is to find the inverse of `pages_read`, so: `Required time = 1/pages_read`\n\nThis simplifies to: `required_time = 1*(pages_read)/c`\n\nNow, since pages_read(hours)= `(c/d) pages/hours(sec)`, the inverse of this is: `required_time", "answer": " 72"}

The next piece of information that is important is the table that says that the number of \"Sitting\" students, 16, is greater than the number of \"In Restroom\" students, 2. \n3. The number of \"Sitting\", 16, can only refer to a whole number because the number of people in the classroom must be a multiple of 6, and is also greater than 4, implying that 16 is the number. \n4. The number of \"Absent\" can also only be a whole number because the total number of students must be a multiple of six, and the total number of students is more than four, hence 16 is the value. \n5. With these first two pieces of information, we can answer the first two questions. \n    a. Number of students in classroom  = 19\n    b. Number of students in restroom  = 2\n\n6. We then have one more piece of information, namely that the number of \"absent\" students, 19, is less than three times the number of students \"sitting\" which means there is more than the \"sitting\" number minus the \"absent\" number. \n7.

In other words, it might be helpful to replace the question with \"how many people in all (not in a specific group) have to walk to school?\"\n\n### Instructed response: \n1. Option A), if it doesn't rain, then how many people have to walk in the (only) rain to go to school.\n2. Option B) If the weather was nice tomorrow, then 1. if X people in all, (in a general sense) go to school, how many people in all then have to walk to school, and 2. and how many people in all have to walk to school?\n\n### Demostration:\n1. Option A): It can still rain if 900 people walk to school, or if only 10 people go to school. 2. Option B): If X people, in some way, have to walk to school because the weather (today) is nice, then this question seeks how many people (in some way) will have to walk (tomorrow) regardless of how many people are actually going to school.\n\n### Result:\nAnswer: Option A\n\nAnswer: 10 people and not 100\n\n### Rationale:\nOption A) The answer is 10, based on the math (1200 people are going to school, but 2 out of 1200 (a 0.17% probability) will be raining so this is \"how many people will walk in the rain to school\" (0", "answer": " 370"}

In order to correctly answer the question, it is important to understand the various steps involved in the process of 'emailing'.\n\n4. The most relevant step to the process is the step that has the 'email' term in it.\n5. A 'confirmation' step for 'email address' or 'email account' fits best, so discard A.\n\n6. Option B: 'email confirmation for the second address' also fits the requirement as it involves 'confirmation for the first address' so it is eliminated.\n\n7. Option C 'confirmy the primary email address' also fits the requriements as it involves 'confirming the primary email address' so it also is eliminated.\n8. Option D 'activate the account' fits this requirement of confirming an email address or account.\n\n9. Option E is incorrect and should be eliminated too. \n\n10. Therefore, the most relevant and important step in an email, in terms of 'occurring', is  `E: Confirm email address`\n\n11. Thus Option D: 'activation' best completes the instruction.\n\n \n\n12. `A: 2 addresses` is not correct here as it is not an important step in the emailing process. \n13. `D: Confirmation account` has the wrong phraseology used as it should be 'Confirmation of email address'. \n\n14. `A: primary email address` is incorrect too. \n\n\n\n[![](https", "answer": " 7"}

They will obviously not keep the rings to themselves.\n\n7: Option A: \u201ckeep them for the wedding\u201d is also a similar option since \u201ckeep them for the couple or groom\u201d could also mean \u201ckeep them for the bride or the wedding\u201d.\n\n8: Therefore, the most plausable choices are A: keep them for the wedding, B: keep them for the couples or A: keep them for themselves.\n\n### Input2:\n\nB:What is the most similar to when they are getting close to something?

This question can be understood by a simple reframing of the prompt: what is the longest length of time to stand still through the drive-thru? This is because the longest distance is, of course, what appears from the user's perspective, the distance in the line at the drive-thru which, in reality, cannot be greater than an arbitrary distance. As such, this distance is not the longest distance. \n\nBecause of this, one may first attempt to prove this through a reframe: the user is not moving. This is unacceptable for a drive-thru, as their order cannot be fulfilled by being stationary. \n\nGiven this, a user drives through the drive-throu, getting from their initial stop to the point in the drive-throu where they need to pick up their food. \n\nFinding what is longest, this means that the user has to drive through the building, and not be stopped by anything.", "answer": " 54"}

This can be confirmed by subtracting 40 from the total number of days.

Looking at each option from option B \u201cUse credit card\" to option E \"Give debit card\":\n2. If the customer doesn't have enough cash, the cashier would want to be able to accept credit cards.\n3.

{"text": "Answer: The farm grew 44 corn cobs.\n\n### Input & Solution\nThe farm grew 44 total corn cobs when put together. One field has 44 rows and the other field has another 44 rows making a total of 88 rows. Each row has 4 corn cobs. So the farm grew 240 individual corn cobs. However, each row does not contain 4 corn cobs total.\n\nThe way to understand this question is to determine how many full rows there is in each field, and then add the number of rows together to get the total number of rows. There are 13 full rows in one field and 16 full rows in the other field. When counting full rows, you must include the partial rows that exist.

The total number of books she has 445 days in the future is 1234.

Afterwards:\n\n\u2022She has 164 remaining books before she can no longer buy new books. (742 \u2013 8 = 164).\n\u2022There's one less book in her collection (1 less than the number of books she had originally, in this case, it's 164).

{"text": "Each of them will pay $1.20 for French fries and $1.10 for each drink.\n\n### Rationale: 1. We can use distributive property to find the price for each of the food that they ordered and see that the result is $12.30. Since each item costs different price, it is given that there is 5/6 of them to share the price evenly. \n\n2. Since they ordered 5 pieces of huger burger: 5p x $3 = $15\n3. Since they ordered 4 sets of French Fries: 4p x $ 1.20 = $4.80\n4. Since they ordered 7 pieces of soda: 7p x $.5 = $3.50\n5. Since they ordered 1 plate of spaghetti: 1p x $2.70 = $2.70\n\n### Total Price = $12.35\n\nSince there are 5/6 of each item (in total 5/6 * total price). So, each of them will pay 5/6 * $12.3 = $1.15\n\n### Note: If there was any number more than 1/6 on the equation, then, we can divide the total price by that number.\n\n### Example: If 7/6 of the bill was taken by the 1 person, 7 (instead of 5) x $10 = $70 and we divided it by 7 gives us $10 as the new price.

{"text": "Input: They buy a pair of shoes costs $50 and spend $200 on a dress.\nRationales:\n1. We can see that Rachel and Sara want some types of things such as shoes and dresses to attend a beauty and a modeling contest.\n2. Then, based on the context and information available, Sara buys a new pair of shoes which cost $50 and a new dress which cost $200.\n3. Now we need to find out how Rachel's shopping budget should be in order to spend twice as much spending money as Sara.\n4. To start with, it's important not to make assumptions or assumptions. This is because you don\u2019t know the prices of the shoes and dresses purchased by Rachel and Sarah. If Rachel only buys shoes and does not buy dresses, Sarah may have bought shoes as well and spent more on them to equal the amount Rachel spent on shoes.\n5. For option A: \"Twice the amount of what Sara spent\", it is unclear whether in this case Sara spent more than Rachel. This option makes assumptions about how much Rachel spends on shoes or the amount she budgets.\n6. Similarly for option B: \"Double the amount of what Sera bought\", it is unclear whether Sara bought shoes or dresses and Sara spent more. The question does not specify either options for clarity.\n7. Option D: \"Twice the price of a pair of shoes\", does not fit the context. A pair of shoes can cost $50 or $5000. Rachel\u2019s expected budget cannot be decided based on this, because it is too vague to say that Rachel should spend $100 on shoes. In contrast, option A & B require assumptions to solve the problem, option C is vague in its context, option D is out of scope.\n8. Option E: \"Rachels\u2019s budget will $100 + Sarahs budget\" matches the context. \n    \u2022 The budget equals the sum of Rachel\u2019s budget and Sara\u2019s budget.

Choices:  Option A: before a meeting happens. Option B: after a meeting has happened.  Option C: in the middle of a meeting. Option D: after a meeting has been postponed. Option E: before an event begins.\nRationales: The question says to \"choose the one that best describes when the question would be asked\". The answers indicate where in the event the event question is asked. Choice C: \"in the middle of a meeting\" is not correct because that would not be a time to ask an event question unless the event occurred within it.\nChoices:  Option A  : before a meeting happens.  When a meeting occurs or happens, you do not ask questions during the meeting. There are no questions asked during a meeting. Therefore, you can cross out choice A and start searching for the correct choice. \nChoices:  B: after a meeting happens. B: after meeting happens.  This seems to fit because you can ask event questions after things have happened.\nChoices: C: in the middle  of (something) is after something.  You would ask questions after things happen, not in the middle of them. Cross out choice C.\nChoices: D: after a meeting is postponed.  If you postpone a meeting, you do not ask any event questions.

The first sentence in the question presents a scenario with three individuals - Anne, Emile, and Maude - where Anne is twice as old as Emile and Emile is six times as old as Anne will be when Maude is eight years old. \n2. To solve this problem, we need to look for a pattern that can help us determine the difference in age from Anne to Emile. \n3. We can notice that there is a time-related pattern, which is the repetition of the time frame \"Anne is 4 times as old as Emille.\" \n4. We need to add two times to Anne's age to get Emile's age. The addition of two times gives us a time frame of \"Anne is 6 times as old as Emmile.\" \n5. We can determine that the time-related pattern has a gap of four times. \n6. Using the time-gap of 4 times, we can find the age difference between Anne and Emille. \n7. Anne's age is double the age of Emille in a five-year gap. \n8.

{"text": "Jan keeps only 75 feet of cable.\n\n### Rationale: \n\nAnalysis\nThis question requires the applicant to make appropriate calculations. Jan buys 10,000 feet of total cable, which she splits into 25-feet sections.  She keeps 1/4 of those and passes them on to her friend.  She keeps half of the rest for herself.  But then she puts the other half in storage. How much cable does she have left on hand now?\n\nLet's start with our first calculation. When you add Jan's total cable purchases together, you get 10,010 feet.  Divide it among the different sections, and you get 1001 feet to each. The original question specified that Jan had 25 feet in each section to begin with, so subtract half of that: 1201/2 to the 25-foot section, leaving you with 20 feet of cable in her first split. Subtract the 1/4 she gave her friend, leaving you with 70 feet in the first split.\n\nNext, let's find how much Jan has left.  We know she has 70 feet of cable from the first split.  Of that, 20 feet is already going to her friend.  The rest of her cable is split again.  She gives away 1/2 again, which means she now has 35 feet left of the 25-feeter. (If you've forgotten your sixth grade math lessons, do the same thing as before: 1001/2 to 35 = 42.75.  You round up to 43 feet instead of 42.76, because nobody is going to be measuring in increments of only one-tenth of a foot!)\nFinally, let's ask why the answer is 35 feet.\nJan ends up with 35 feet of cable for herself.\nHer friend is holding 20 feet, but will need 10 more so that she has 30 feet of cable to begin with -- leaving just 10 feet of it that she can pass along to someone else.\nThe remainder for Jan is 35 feet!\nSo, there was 90 feet left over with a little bit", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "John needs to earn 83.33 more dollars to reach his goal of $60.\n\n### Input Example:\n\nI earn $957.50 per hour and I have eight hours off work each week. Each day I want to spend at least 4 hours on social media, 2 hours studying and 6 hours for grocery shopping and food. Then I can spend the remaining time on eating, showering and relaxing.

The list does not specify the exact amount of money available, but only the minimum allocation of each. The total of all the expenses and obligations cannot exceed the total amount available.\n\n### Solution:\n\nThe budget must include the amount required to account for each minimum expense or obligation. The total funds available cannot be less than the sum of all the amounts. If a minimum requirement is met, the additional funds can be used for discretionary spending.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe total of all the minimum expenses or obligations must be less than or equal to the total available funds. Otherwise, the person won't be able to meet their budget and won't be able spend anything on discretionary items.\n\nThe person can choose to spend all their available funds on discretionary expenses or obligations, since they can afford to.\n\n### Response Example:\n\nI have 100p available and spend at least 50p on social media, 30p on studying, 75p on grocery shopping & food, 1c on food, 30p eating, 40p on showering, 3p on relaxing.

{"text": "Jim has 12 Buicks total.\n\nDetailed explanation:\n\nTo start solving, we can use the given information to identify or eliminate the answer choices.\nAs provided, Jim collects model cars and he has 3 different types of model cars: Buicks, Fords and Chevys.\nWe consider the number of Buicks and Fords Jim has to eliminate the options E and F.\nE: Buicks \u00d7 Fords, by setting this equal to 4, we obtain a x 4 = 4. Multiplying both sides by the unknown x, we end up with 4 x = 4. After simplifying, the unknown number of Buicks is x = 1. \n\nF: Buicks + Fords, by setting Buicks to 1, we still end up with 1 less Fords than Fords + Buicks.\n\nTherefore, we have 1 - 2 x 3 = 3. We can also eliminate 3 because in Jim's collection, Ford  has a higher value than Chevy, thus Jim has 1 more Ford than Chevy, therefore 1 + x 2 = 4. x 2 > x 3 -> x = 2. \n\nNow, we have Buicks + Fords + Chevys = 201.\n\nWe can use the above information and the relation between cars to determine the number of each type of cars.\nIn Jim's collection, there are 12 Buicks and 9 Ford.\nHence, the answer is choice A: 12 Buicks.\n\n\n### Input : You do work of $106, and you made a total profit of $354.44.

{"text": "The total time is 8 minutes\n\n### Rationale:\n\nIn the question stem, it states that at each minute she spends 3 minutes per tantrum and 5 minutes per practicing in addition to the minute dedicated to opera performance. If 6 minutes are dedicated to singing then we can breakdown the minute spent on performance and 7 spent on tantrum and practice, which would give us a total of +4 minutes for the tantrum and practice.\n\nBut total time is 8, which is a negative value of 4. If we ignore the negative sign and add the 4 from tantrum with practice, we get total of 7 = 8. Thus, we need to find the 5th number from the left, which is 3, from the first set. Which means 3 of tantrum time and 4 of practicing should be removed to get perfect answer.\n\n**Explanation:**  \nAt first glance, the question stem and the numbers can be a bit intimidating.  \nYou need to identify how the numbers are connected and how one is related to another.  \nThe answer is based on a simple pattern.  \nLet's break the numbers down.  \nIf we look at the number of minutes it takes for Carlotta to perform on the stage, we realize it is 6 min.  \nEach minute of the performance gets interrupted with a tantrum or more practicing time.  \nFor every minute she spends on performing, she spends an extra 3 min. on tantrum and 5min. practicing.  \nIf we assume 20 minutes is dedicated solely to practicing, then rest of the time is spent on practicing and tantrums.\n\n### Input : What is the value of x?  \n\n### Choices:  A : 10  \n\n### B : 5  \n\n### C :  3  \n\n### D : 2  \n\n### E : 10", "answer": " 54"}

Since the rate doubled in the second hour, Bob created 4 questions x1x3 divided by 2: x1+x3=48.\n\n### Explanation: \nIn this problem you need to figure out how many questions he creates in 3 hours.  In the first hour Bob created 13 questions.  In the second hour, he doubled his rate to create 26 questions (you should double your rate by dividing by 1/2; for the purposes of this problem, assume he doubled his rate).  The third hour was his final hour and he once again doubled to create 52 questions.  The rate was 13, then 26, then 52.  You should calculate his total questions using the product of each hour he worked (13, 26, 52) which is 91.  Now just divide 91 by his rate each period and that gives you 3.61 questions per hour.  To find out how many questions Bob created in the entire 3 hours, you just multiply 3.61 times by 3.

In this case, we say that she either has 8 or 16 fish.\n2. Since she has 4 more angel fish but she has twice the guppies as angel fish, one of the two options must be correct. This means we can either disprove the existence of 12 and 10 or assume the existence of 16, so either way we can't have 12 fish.\n3. Now that the above is clear, and for clarity we know she has at most 16, so her answer can only be 16.\n4. Catriona has a total 16 fish in her aquarium in the possible outcomes.", "answer": " 44"}
{"text": "The Skipper's ship had been blown west for 30 kilometers.\n\n### Explanation: We can analyze the question by breaking it into smaller sections where we answer each question as it arises.\n\nAssumption 1: After the storm, the ship was no longer moving due east.\nAssumption 2: After the storm, ship was no longer moved by the force of moving at a constant speed\nAssumption 3: After the storm, only the wind had moved the ship.\n\nWe can understand that we are given all the necessary information to answer the question.\n\n## Analysis:\n1. Skip back to the first line \"On the first day of a journey, Skipper sailed his vessel due east\".\n2. There are 3 possible actions that we could take in this moment.\n   1. We could keep going by following the same action.\n   2. We could turn off the engines and rest.\n   3. We could stop and find a place to camp for the evening.\n   4. We could turn back.\n   5. However, according to Assumption 1, we know that the skipper turns off the engines and rests.\n3. We then continue further to the next lines \"For 20 hours at 30km/h\".\n4. We can now take the action to rest, and understand that we are going to keep going in this question.\n   5. The first half of the journey is taken to stay at a speed of 60kmph, however, due to Assumption 2, this is no longer true.\n   6. We are now resting, but what does that do to our position?\n5. We then examine the next line \"his vessel\" and learn that the \"his vessel\" is now only \"his vessel\"\n6. This action (not following the constant speed of 30mps) has moved the ship back to its final position\n7. We can then restate the question where we now understand 2 facts:\n   1. We are now closer to our destination than when we started.\n   2. At least 10 hours have been spent resting.\n8. Now that we know these 2 facts, we can move on to answer the final question\n9.

{"text": "#### Solution\n1. The given problem describes a situation where Alison purchased 9 storage tubs ranging from large to small ones.\n2.  The 6 small storage tubs cost $48, so the large tub had cost $48-$6= $42 and the small tubs had cost $6.\n\n### Rationale\n1. To answer the question completely, we need to provide an equation in such a way that small can be isolated from large. \n\n\nIn order to isolate the variable of small from the variable of large, we consider the context of price per tube where large is expensive and small is lightweight and inexpensive.\n\nLet the number of large tubs be denoted by \"x\" and the number of small tubs be denoted by small.\n\nLet the cost of one large tub be $6x, and $y for a small tub.\n\n\\$ \\$\n\n\\[\\$ 6x\\$ \\$\n\nThen we get a total cost of $\\displaystyle6x+y$ for large and $\\displaystyle y$ for small.\n\n\\[\\$ $6x +y$\\$ \\\n\nHence we have the equation $$6x = x + y$$ or $$y = 6 - x$$\n\nThis means that the cost per one small tub is $12 - x$ and that the cost of $6x$ big tubs is $6 - x + x$ which results in $42 - x$ dollars per large tub.\n\n\\[\\]6\\[\\]x \\\n\nNow we have one equation describing the cost of the large tubs and a second equation (small) showing a possible expression for the cost of a single small storage tub.\n\n\\$\\$ \\$6x$\\$ \\$\n\nSince the large tubs cost is constant at $6 - x$ for the same variable of number of large tubs ($x$), we can subtract the above formula for $6x$.  We get the second equation, $6x-42=6-x+x=y$. We get $y=42$. Hence, the total cost is $54.$\n\nThere is also a possibility of a cheaper cost for 12 large tubs because $x$ is also variable, it's just the number of large tub required that we cannot isolate. \n\nIf", "answer": " 5"}

A  remaining invitations represent 40%.\n\n### Solution:\nMartin invited 5 people from home town and twice as many people as invited from school, so he invited 5+2x, which is 14 people, from school.\n\nWe see that he invited 5+14=19 people from school, which leaves us with (20% of 29) - 2 people still uninvited.\n\nSo he invited 3 people from school, leaving a remainder of 2 people.\n\nHe invited 5 people from hometown, so we subtract that number from the total to get invitations from this group, 2.\n\nSo he has invited 5 from hometown and 3 from school, giving us a total of 6 invitations from hometown.\n\nWe know that he invited as many people from the sport club as from hometown and school.\n\nHe invited the same number from hometown and from school, so that leaves us with 11 people from the sport club, which was exactly as many as the sum from the hometown and school he invited from.\n\nSo he had 5 and 3 from hometown, 6 from hometown, and 11 sport club.\n\nSubtracting all those numbers from 19 invitations from school, leaves 11 or the remaining invitations to be 11/19, which rounds to 6 or the desired number. \n\n### Response Instruction:\nAnswers the following multiplication questions.\n\n### Rationales: 1) First, we will multiply all the digits in the first part by the given multiplier.

{"text": "The correct answer is A: $25.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Analysis:\nWe first note that the key aspect is to determine the cost of the party, since this is the amount subtracted from the total contributions, and so will necessarily be what we're left with after paying people in order to cover their shares. The total contributions made will be a multiple of the number of attendees, but we know that there were 50 attendees present, so we can simply calculate how much each attendee contributed and multiply this number times the total number of attendee to determine the total contributions for the event.\n\n2. Strategy\nWe want to come up with a simple calculation that will tell us the cost of the event. Let's start by thinking about the contributions made to cover it - each person was asking for $100 in order to attend, and we know that there were exactly 50 people in attendance. We can immediately write the desired result as $100 * 50 = $5,000 in contributions to cover the expenses paid.\nNow, we want to come up with 500, how much more they contributed to cover the expenses. First, what is the total cost of the event? We know that the reunion cost $5,00 so this must be equal to the remaining money (after contributions) we have for the event. This implies we have $5,005,000 - $5,00 = $5, while we have $500 more that the money they contributed, meaning we'll simply need to calculate $500 - $500 = $0.00.\n3. Solution\nBy coming up with specific variables to denote the desired values, we can easily go about coming up with the correct solution. We have $500 in contributions, since the $1 for the number of attenes was already accounted for by the number of people there. Our total contributions are $5,00 * 5,00 = 25,000, but since we know that each person paid in the exact amount of $100, then we should be able to determine what the cost of the event is via: $5000 + 25,0500 = 30,005", "answer": " 4500"}

{"text": "$1451.22\n\n#### Rationale\n\n1. Starting with the total of the 7 experienced sailors (164.29 hours worktime), add 5 \u00d7 (1/3) ($7.78 per time-hours for each inexperienced) = $38.92.\n2. Then, add 5 \u00d7 (5/12) ($6.11 hourly pay for experienced sailors) = $15.23.\n3. Subtract 5 \u00d7 (18/12) ($36.25 hours in total, for 5 inexperienced to complete their 60 hour requirement) + 5 \u00d7 (12/12) = $386.48 (cost).\n4. Subtract $342.63 (from the $1451).\n5. The result is $1451, which $1451 - 342.61 = $1108.39.\n6. Therefore, the total combined monthly paycheck for all 7 experienced sailors is $1458.39. \n7.

On the first plant, they would be 6, on the second plant, they would be seven and on the third plant, they would be nine. So, the remaining leaves per plant would be what is left over. It does not matter which leaves on each plant turn yellow, the leaves that fall off would be divided between the other leaves. The first plant would have 3, the second plant would have 4 and the third plant would have 5 leaves.

{"text": "The correct answer is B: 216 legs.\n\n### Rationales:\n### 1. Consider option A: 720 legs. This option is incorrect because it includes both the legs from the broken tables and chairs. Since the task refers specifically to remaining furniture, broken parts should not be included in the calculations.\n### 2. The number of chairs and tables is important information to use in calculating the remaining furniture. Thus, option B: 80 chairs and 20 tables, which includes both types of furniture, is the correct answer. This gives 380 * 5 (for the 5 legs of each chair) and 20 * 3 (for the 3 legs of each table), totaling 1900 legs. This quantity, however, includes the furniture broken in the previous month, so it should be subtracted from the original. By applying 100 * 40 (the percentage of broken furniture), we get 4000 legs. We subtract 1900 from this number in order to find the number of remaining legs, which gives us the answer B: 210 legs.\n\n## Additional Practice Questions\n\n### 88.

{"text": "My birthday must be during the summer.\n\n### Rationale:We can assume that both my age and my brother's age are less than 45 years old to account for our ages being less than 45 combined. Then from the information given, we can conclude the following:\n\n-My brother's age (let's denote it as X) is no more than 2X, so that the sum of our ages is 45 years old (2X + 2*(X-1) = 45 years old).\n-My age is let's denote as Y, then the sum of our ages (2X+Y) plus X is 45. We can substitute the values of X and Y as the equation then gets simplified.\n\n-The equation becomes 2*(Y+X) + Y = 45, so that Y = 45+Y-2X. But we know that the equation to find Y is now simplified as 2*(Y+2*X+X)+Y = 45, and now Y = 2*X+X+Y = 45/2 = 22.5 years old.\n-Thus, when I was 22.5+Y years old this summer (i.e. this year), my brother was X years old. Now, we know that X is less than Y, and we also know that the sum of their ages is equal to 45, so this means that I am Y years old.

The sentence \"The weight of the apple will not be given as...\" conveys the idea that the actual weight of the apple is being excluded from the stated range of possible answers.\n3. It can be analyzed that the weight of the apple cannot be discarded or excluded from the range, therefore, the answer to choose is the smallest number from all the choices given to make the range balanced.\n4.

Option F: \"include\" directly matches our interpretation of excluding the apple weight which is unsuitable since it will disrupt the range balance. (F: 10 pond 1000 g)\n7. Option E: \"include\" can mean that the weight of the whole apple is within the range, which doesn't necessarily make sense and doesn't match the context of the exclusion, therefore, we eliminate it. (E: 4 pond 750g)\n8. Then, looking at options C and E, we see that they both represent weight measurements. Option E is the smaller, therefore, it is closer to the weight of actual apple which is not given as an answer, therefore it is the correct answer. (C: 500 g)\n9.

{"text": "She paid $68/month in taxes.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. Starting with Angelica's monthly salary from her job and how much she pays for daily necessities we have\n  - $42/(month)\n  - $80/(month)\n1. From these numbers, we can see that Angelina paid $42 per month for daily necessities and $80 per month from her job. \n2. To break the expenses per month, we will do so for Angelina's daily necessities and her job income.\n3. By this, we have\n  - 1. $42/(month = Daily Necessities)\n  - 2. 42/(month = Job Income)\n4. Adding these two numbers, we had\n  - 1+ 2  = 42/(Month)\n4. So according Angelica Angelita's monthly expenses are $42/(month). \n5. In addition, we will add Angelica's salary each month, $80 / month.\n6. So $80 + $42 = 122/(month)\n7. Since Angelica's month has 30 days, the number of expenses each day is about $4.07/(day).\n8. By multiplying 4.07 / day *30 = $122/(day)\n9. Now, we multiply Angelica's remaining funds by the number of days in the month $18/(day)\n10. So the total funds Angelica had in her account $4.07 * 30 + $18 = 68/(day) \n11.

{"text": "Option C\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: What type of animal eats a lot in just a short period of time? Choices:  C: elephant D: lion E: zebra F: rhino\nRationales: In this question, we can tell that there's a possibility of an incorrect answer choice, as multiple of these animals will eat \"a lot\" in a \"short period of time\". The statement also indicates that the type of animal is not necessarily a herbivore or an omnivore.\n\nThinking about the phrase a \"short period of a time\", we'll focus our attention to the phrase 'period' in the statement. 'Period' typically refers to a longer time, such as one that lasts days or even years. However, when used in comparison of the short phrase \"just a short period of time\" it should refer to a shorter period, such as minutes. Based on this understanding and reasoning, we can eliminate options A through D as they would be incorrect considering the shorter time specified in the sentence. Also excluding option D: lion, based on the fact that it is an apex predator and not a bulky eater. \n\nNext, let's consider the statement regarding multiple animals that \"eat a lot\" in this time. From this point on we need to consider that there's more than one animal that \"eats a lot\" in this \"short period of time\" \n\nSo, considering that \"many animals\" are described as \"eaters\" by the statement, each eater must consist of the animal that \"eats many\". \n\nBased on this understanding, we can then eliminate option E: zebra from consideration as it is an herbivore that eats \"grass\". Since this vegetation is small in size, eating it would not match the description required by the sentence of multiple animals that \"eats a big amount of food in just a short period in time\".  \nNext, the remaining options are: option C: elephant, and option F: rhino. In this step we can disregard option A: C, since \"Elephants\" are herbivores, and cannot be considered for this sentence task. We can disregard option D: lion and option B: F: Zebra because the lion and the zeb", "answer": " 820"}

{"text": "Input: What did the child have to do to find the gold? Choices:  Melt the clay A: Bust the pottery C: Scrub the clay D: Chop the stone E: Dig the soil\nRationales:\n1. From the prompt, it's clear that the child had to do something to locate gold.\n2. The child may have found clues or hidden areas that could eventually lead to the gold, so it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to go to a store and buy gold.\n3. Therefore looking at the options, only answer choices that involve searching or excavating seem plausible. \n4. option A: \u201cBust the pottery\u201d directly indicates the action needed to find gold. \n5. option B: \u201cScrub the clay\u201d also refers to excavation as its the removal of dirt, dust or mud from surfaces. \n6. Option C: \"chop the stone\" doesn't indicate excavation but involves cutting through stone with a tool like an axe.\n7. Option D: \"Dig the soil\" is also incorrect because options can be multiple of the same item in the answer set. Also, digging does not directly imply finding gold. \n8. Finally, \"Digging the soil\" indicates the action of digging rather than finding gold, so this leaves the only option as A: Bust the Pottery.\n9. As the answer is \"bust\", the corresponding explanation is \"the pottery bust\".\n10. So, the child had to do a \"bust\" to find the gold. \n\nReference: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6812084594796587360", "answer": " 700"}

{"text": "John travels a distance of (30 min x (4 \u2661 30 \u2667 6 \u2664 0000001)) miles. This means John travels a distance of 950 miles.\n\n### Explanation:\nFrom the wording of the question, the following information is known:\n\n1. John (person) jogs at 4 mi/hr alone, but runs at a speed of 6 mi/hr when being dragged by his dog.\n2. John and his dog both run for a total of 30 minutes, giving them a total speed of either 4 / 4 / 30 / 1 or 6 / 30 /1.\n3. Based on the question, John continues to run for an additional 35 minutes.\n4. John runs with his dog and his dog drags along another 100 lbs for a combined drag of 100 lbf.\n\nCombining the information of these four points, we can formulate a new equation. Let's call 4 x 30 x 1 (or 6 x 30 x1) (for our convenience) as v1 and give it a name. Now let's call the rest of the factors as v2. v1 is John's velocity alone, while v2 is what his dog adds on top of v1 as he is dragging it. Thus, we can formulate: v1 + v2 = 9.5 mi/hr\n\nThen, our initial equations simplify to: v1 + v1 = 9.5, v2 + v2 = 17.5, or (v1+v2) (v1+v1) = 26.5\n\nFrom this, we simplify (v1+v_1)(v1+v1)=26.5 into two simultaneous equations as follows:\n\n      x  + y   = 2(26.5)\n -----------------+---------\n \u2664 \u2667 \u2664  + \u2664   + \u2664  =\n\nNow that we have all the variables, let's plug them together.\n\nIn order to calculate the values for x and y, we will use the cross-multiplication", "answer": " 5"}

A ride for a bumper cost $2, a ride for a space ship cost $4, and the ride for a Ferris wheel costs $5. For each ride you ride, you pay the costs of that ride.\nMara did two rides, which means she paid $4. This is because she did a ride costing $2 and paid $2, then the second she did, she paid another $2.\nSo her costs of rides= 2*2\nRiley also did four rides, which means he paid the total of $8.\n1.

As the total number of pats is 189, it means all the 10 dogs combined with the 17 cats has the total number of 189.\n2.  There are only 2 options in the problem, i.e. dogs and cats which show a total of 189 dogs and cats. But the ratio of dogs to cats is 10 : 7. In such a case the total number of dogs that she possesses is 59, i.e. (10 x 17) + 5 x 9.\n\n3.  The ratio of 10 cats to the remaining dogs is 59 : 27 which means 59 cats and 27 dogs in total.\n4.

Based on that the choice here is none.\n    Therefore, the correct answer is B: stop and gather their supplies.\n    Answer: B: stop and gather supply\n\n### Input What would you call a place that has no more children?

Choices: A: fingernail brush B: a scrubber C: a buff D: lotion E: moisture\n\nRationales:\n1. It is important to analyze the question correctly. The question asks you what you will need to keep your fingeanrs and skin healthy.\n2. It implies that maintaining your fingernails healthy will also involve the health of your skin.\n3. Consider the choices from A to E. The most common ones that come to mind are a fingernail brushed, buffer, lotion, and moisture.\n4. The correct answer then should be a combination of those options that could improve your fingernails AND keep your skin healthy. \n5. Option A is not suitable as brushing removes dust and dirt from your nails. It does NOT help you keep them healthy.\n6. Option B scrubber is not suitable either. \n7. Option C also does not qualify as it is a polishing tool used to shine metal. It is not related to the fingernails.\n8. Option D, which is lotion, does not qualify as lotions generally help by moisturizing the skin, giving it a fresh look.\n8. And finally, you are left with Option E: moisture. It is a suitable option because moisture has both a positive and a negative impact on the fingernails and the skin. Too much moisture could affect your nails, and too little could dry up your skin.\n9. Therefore, the answer is E. It will be your \"go-to\" choice for keeping both your fingers and skin healthy.

The sentence provides the information that the store sold 42 candies that were individually wrappe.\n2. Thus, the sentence describes the action of individually wrapping 42 candies.\n3. Thus, A: the sentence provides the information that a store sold 42 wrapped and 21 individually wrapped candies. \n4. Now, when we consider the meaning of individually wrapping, it involves attaching the wrapper individually for each candy.\n5. This means that the store sold 21 individually wrapped candy and 21 that were already wrapped.\n6. So the action that the sentence describes is \"Individually wrapping 42 candys\".\n7. Choice B: When individually wrapping each of a number C of candies, 21 such individually wrapped candies are wrapped.\n8. Choice A: When individually wrapping each one from a number 32 of candies and then wrapping individually wrapped candies, 22 individually wrapped candies are produced.\n9. Thus the sentences only produce 22 individually wrapped and not 42 individually wrapped candies.So, the correct answer is B \nAnswer: B: the store sold a total of wrapped and individually wrapped candys, \n\n### Input 1.

{"text": "28\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question starts by describing the behavior of the monster, which then goes on to provide information about the ships and the people each ship carried over the hundred year interval. We can then use this information to derive answers for the question.\n\nConsidering the rate at which people are eaten (i.e. the monster feasts on every hundred years), we get that there were 847 people eaten over the first 100 years.\n\nConsider the number of people on each ship over the same period of 100 years:\n\n    First ship: 1 person\n    Second ship: 2 people\n    Third ship: 4 people\n    Fourth ship: 8 people\n   ...\n   ...\n    Fifth ship:  168 people\n    Sixth ship: 336 people\n   ...\n\nSince each ship doubled the capacity of the previous ship, we can make a rough estimate of how many people were on each ship after a certain number of years. We can do so by assuming that the numbers represent the total amount of people carried by the ship:\n\n    First Ship: 1 people\n    Second Ship: 2 people\n...\n   Fifth Ship: 168 people\n   Sixth Ship: 336people\n...\n    Nth Ship: 2 ** n+1 people  \n        (2 being the rate at which the ships double in size, one person from previous ship adds up to 2 people to total count for the next ship that it's doubling in size)\n\nTo estimate the population of the sixth ship, we can write it as 336 = n + 1 and then solve for n, which gives us n=334. The fourth ship is, then, the fifth ship plus 1 person. Solving for n, we get that it's the 169 + 1. The third ship is 4 (which is the total people of the previous ship) plus 1. Solving for n again, we get it to be 5. The second ship, then, is 2 plus 1 from the first ship's population of 1. So, n=3. We can then say that there are 2 + 3 = 5 people in the second ship.", "answer": " 121"}

{"text": "The logic here is \"If Bill and Dale eat X, and Ann and Cate both eat Y, then there is no excess left\". And then it takes a guess.\n\n### Logic:\n\nStep 1: The order of the question is very important: If Bill, Ann, Cate, Dale each buy personal pizzas and all 4 eat, they will each eat only 1/4, meaning that if Bill and Dale eat theirs and Ann and Cate do not, there is still 1/4 on the plate.\n\nStep 2: We have three questions to make sure we don't over-estimate the amount of the plate.\n\n### 1.Is Bill eating > 50 % of the whole plate\n\n1. If yes, then how much is Cate eating?\n2. If yes, how much is Ann eating?\n3. If yes, Ann's whole piece > 50 % because Cate is less than her, so Ann must eat it all.\n\n### And then the question is \"How many pieces?\"\n\n### 2. Is Dale eating > 5% of the whole plate\n1. If yes then (assume Ann eats 50% of it all) how much of Dale's 75% will Ann eat?\n2. So then Dale's eats 400/600=0.667, which should be less than 1 if Ann ate half 0.5=0.25, meaning one of Bill, Cate, or Dale eats more than 3/4 of the plate.\n2. So, if we just do a guess, the answer is Dale eating more, but Ann's piece of Bill's pizza is not 50% because she ate Dale's share. So Dale probably has the most.\n\n### Answer:\n\nAssumption: Bill, Cate, Ann, and Dale buy 4x personal pan pizzas.\n\nSuppose \"a\" equals 400 (Bill's first piece), \"b\" equals 460, (Bill's second piece), \"c\" equals 600 (Bill) and \"d\" equals 40 (D", "answer": " 6"}

This number can be calculated using the given information.\n\t* Each pile of 12 monkey hands would have 25 x 14 = 350 bananas.\n\t* Each hand of 15 monkeys would have 33 x 14 =358 bananas.\n\t\t* 496 bananas / 6 = 83 bananas per hand.

She is left with $28 - $1 = $27.\nAs she puts it in her wallet, the dog will get 2/27 of her money(2/7 = 2/27)which will leave her with $24. She then puts the remaining $25 into her sock(5/24 = 5/27=5/25)which leaves her with $7.  Finally, she leaves the remaining $7 which accounts for $6 7/8ths of what she had, which comes up to $1.25(67/8 =46/8 = 1.6875), so $1.25 is all she has left.  As she doesn't have $25, she doesn't have enough money to buy another milkshake, and as there is no leftover money after buying one milkshake and putting half that money back into savings, she has to leave the money in the wallet for the dog to shred - which will only shred a tenth of the money.

The statement is incorrect since it assumes that humans will not make it feasible. Feasibility is subjective and may vary with time. If the statement were true in the ancient times then it couldn\u2019t have been false in modern times.\n2. Additionally, the word 'feasible' implies a state of being possible and practical.\n3. Since the second part of the statement explicitly mentions that 'they would not', it becomes illogical to assume that the 'humans will not make it more feasable'.\n4.

{"text": "26 minutes per week.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nEach person works at his/her own pace to do the task once. The task is done for twice each week, so the number of minutes it will take for all three people to clean the rooms together is the sum of their individual times, i.e. the number of minutes each person spends per week to do the task is the sum of all their respective times together.\n\n### Example:\n\n* Example for 5 12 6\n\nEach of them cleans their rooms for once in 5, 12 and 6 minutes each. So taking all their times together, their times sum up to be 27 minutes. Thus, they each spend 27/3=9.333 minutes each to clean their rooms.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe sum of individual times\n\n\\((\\text{# minutes})_{Richard}=22 \\qquad (\\text{# minutes})_{Cory}=25 \\qquad (\\text{# hours})_{Blake}=28 \\qquad \\text{# minutes=}\\text{# hours}\\times{100})\\)\n\nThe two times for each of the three persons are\n\n\\(\\text{# minutes}_{Richard}=22_{56}\\)\n\n\\(\\text{. minutes}_{Cory}=(25_{56})\\;\\text{# minutes}_{Blake}=25_{56}={0.28\\times25}\\)\n\nWe know that 100 minutes=1 hour. Thus, when the two times are multiplied by 100 (e.g. 0.25), it'd give a result greater than 56 as 56 minutes is less than an hour. Hence, we must multiply the individual times obtained individually by 56 (multiplying each by 56 will give 5.6).\n\n### Example for 5 9\n\n* Example for (5minute)2=25 minutes\n\n\\(\\text{(# minutes}_{Richard})=22_{56}\\qquad (\\text{# minutes}_{Cory})=25_{56}\\qquad \\text{# minutes}_{Bake}=28_{56}\\qquad 1\\text{# min}=5\\text{# sec}\\implies \\text{# min}=56\\)\n\nThe", "answer": " 136"}

She needed to deliver 8 times <u>as many</u> packages as meals.\nIf she needed to deliver 27 packages and meals combined, how <u>many</u> meals does she deliver\nRationales:\n1. The question asks for the number of meals Angela delivers.\n2. The context of the question is that Angela is a bikey messenger.\n3. The words \"As many\" indicate that the units of the answer must be multiplied.\n4. The question specifies that a total of 27 packages and dishes must be delivered as one combined unit.\n5. In this context, the number of packages will be 27 divided by 8, or 3, which translates to 3 packages.\n6. The number of dishes will be 27 - 3 packs or 24 dishes, which translate into 24 dishes.\n7. Therefore the total number of dishes is 24 + 3 = 27 dishes or 27 packages.\n8. Now the question asks how many meals Angela delivered.\n9.

{"text": "Daniel spent at least $376\n\n### Explanation:\n\nDaniel spent a minimum of $322 on the video games after considering all the prices and the amount of each price. Also, he spent a maximum of $738 by considering all the prices and amount of each price. The answer can be any number in this range. 1. The first 80 video games were purchased for $12 each and cost a combined cost of at least $1,296. But, since each one was purchased for $12, only a combined cost of $96 can be deduced for the other 426 video games. 2. The remaining video games cost $3 each, so Daniel spent a minimum of $818 on the other 366 video games. 3. Daniel spent at least $1,184 on the video games. However, Daniel spent no more than $818 for the other 364 games, leaving at most $367 for his 80 games purchased for $12. Therefore, no matter which way the other video games are subtracted from the total cost, the video games purchased for $1,2, cost at least $1184. 4.

Then, we use the pattern, and it is necessary to add 6 and 11, which is 17. \nTo find the next number, you just have to get the sum of the numbers in the previous step (17). The previous number is 6 because it is the first time the series is done. So, it would be something like this: 1 + 6 = 7; 2 + 7 = 9; 3 + 9 = 12; 4 + 12 = 16; 5 + 16 = 2", "answer": " 2290"}

The child is 6 years old. E. The youngest child in the family is a boy. \nF. The number of children in the family is 4, and their ages range from 1 year to 7 years.\nRationales:  1. The table presents basic data about the Brown family, where each child's age is represented by an index from 1 to 7.\n2. Therefore, the question needs to evaluate the information in the table to identify specific details about the Brown family.\n3. The table provides the following information:  The youngest child in family is a boy. There are 3 girls in the family. The second child in the family is 2.5 years old. The number of children and their ages range from one year to seven years. The last child in the family is nine years old.\n4. From the table we can conclude that the Brown family has at least 3 children and that one of them is a boy. If we assume that the eldest of the children in the family is seven years old, this would mean that the youngest of the family must be nine years old or less.\n5. With this information, the answer to the question regarding a child aged 6 is B: \"the child of age 6\".\n6. Now, looking at the answer choice B: \"the child is 6 years,\"  it's the same as giving a choice that the child is 6 years, so this won't work as well.\n7.

The check is used to verify that the encrypted message has been properly encrypted and only the intended recipient can decrypt it. This ensures that the message is only able to be read by the intended recipient and is secure from unauthorized viewing.\n### Additionally, the question of how it's possible addresses the encryption algorithm used. 320 is an integer, so it's possible to multiply 320 by 2. 320 x 2= 640. That means encryption is possible using 640-BIT Cards. \n### Input:The guy from the city wants to know how to start a campfire.\n### Response: Tell him the directions.\n### Rationelle: Because knowing the directions is what is necessary to start a campfire as mentioned in the question. \n### Therefore, the best logical answer is D= directions.\n### Input:If one were to give the directions, what would he say?\n###", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "9 1/2 square feet.\n\n### Additional Explanation: 1. Starting with the first present, we require the square footage to wrap the whole present. 2. The square footage to wrap only the first present is 2. 3. To cover the second present, we require 3/4 of the amount required to cover one present = 6. 4. Using the same square footage for both presents we can wrap both the presents, then we require the rest 1/4 of the amount to wrap the first present. 5. In short 3 presents requires wrapping them completely, requires a total of wrapping area of 2 + 6 + 1/4 = 9 1/4 square feet. Rounding gives 10 square feet. 6. Rounding to the next half foot means dropping the fraction 1/4 and rounding the 9/4 to 9/5 = 1.8 + 0.1/.5 = 9.5 but rounded to the nearest integer is 9. We are only interested in the number of square feet to be used, so rounding to the nearest half foot, which is.5, gives 9 1/5, then round again to the nearest integer is = 9 1 / 2.\n1.

{"text": "$2.60.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. Let us begin to break down this question by converting all the values into a common base.\n2. We will start by converting Gratuity into a relative value which makes it easier to find this.\n3. First gratuity is calculated by multiplying by 18%.\n4. As we work with decimals, multiply 10.8 which is.108.\n5. This gratuity can be expressed as 18% x 10.8 = 1.88\n6. Second gratuity is calculated in the same manner.\n7. We just need to multiply by 10% to get a gratuity of 1.0\n8. This brings our total gratuity to 2.\n9. Gratuity can now be expressed as 2.0.\n10. The next step is to convert $2.0 to a relative value.\n11. We can multiply by 100 to make it into percentage (%) which makes it easier to see the problem.\n12. This gratuity value is then converted to relative value as 2%.\n13. $2 is then multiplied by 10 in order for us to see the decimal\n14. This is then divided by 100 in order for us get the percentage value.\n15. This is then multiplied by the percentage to get a relative value.\n\n### The result is as follows\n\nThe correct result here is $2.60 because the final gratuity of the bill is calculated as follows.\n\n$$2gratuity*(100\\%)*(10\\%)$$\n\nThis has been simplified as follows.\n\n$2gratuity*(2)$\n\nThis is then converted from a decimal back into a relative value.", "answer": " 41"}

Choices: \n- A: a gift B: a vase C: a dress D: a tree E: a picture\nRationales:1. \"What do you buy to make gift\" implies the use of gift to make another gift.

So we can eliminate D: a picture, we can see that it is a picture with some frame work. Not like a frame to hold anything. So, we cannot take a picture to make it a gift.\n5. Option E: A picture- it is a picture without a frame. If put in the right frame, we can call it artwork of some sort, we cannot use it to make other gifts directly but indirectly, there might be indirect ways to transform it into a gift.

{"text": "Let's start with the first step of this problem. The only given information is that the girl scouts made $30 from selling delicious cookes.\n\nWe know that it costs $2.50 to go to the pool, and since 10 people are planning on going, it will cost their group a total of $25.\n\nWe also know, that in order to cover this cost, they need $30. Hence, their goal is to come up with a sum with a sum of $30.\n\nGiven this, what's the easiest way we can find this sum? By plugging in some numbers and using subtraction.\n\nOur current equation is: ($30 / 10) + (7 * 2.5)\n\nNow plug in some numbers. Let's say X represents the total amount of money they receive by selling the cookies.\n\n\\$(X / 10) = 1 / 10\\$ = $1.\n\nWhen we multiply this by 7, we get 7 * $1 = 7.\n\nNow, 7 + 2.5 comes out to be 7.5 + 2.5 = 10.00\n\nLooking at the last number there, if we round it, we get 10.0.\n\n$30.0 equals or is the same as 10.\n\nWe can also see this mathematically.\n\nIf 30 equals 10, then 30 - 10 is equal to or less than 20, right?\n\nWe know 30 = 10.\nWe are told that 2.5 * 10 is cost of pool trip. (30 + 2.5 *10 = 49.5)\n\nSo, 49.5 - 30 = 49 - 30 = -9.5 (subtracting these numbers leads to -9.5)\n(-9.5) + (10 * 0.5) = -9.5 + 5 = -4.5 (addition 0.5*10 is cost of transportation).\n\nThus, $4.5 can be spent and still 10 be left\n\n### Instru", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "After reading the whole instructions, our first task in the answer calculation is to determine how much of the newscast time is devoted to national news.

The answer should be greater than zero, but less than 12. In other words, the answer must be a whole number of whole minutes. After that, we must subtract sports time from the total time, resulting in an answer of 12 minus 5= 7 for the time devoted to sports. Now, we can simply subtract the 12 minutes of news plus the 7 minutes of sports from 30, our total minutes, and we have 8 minutes + 2 minutes advertising.

{"text": "Solution\n\nA vacation day is equal to 8 hours of work. Similarly, a sick day is equal to 5.5 hours of work.\n\nThe employee starts the year with 10 vacation and 10 sick days.\n\nThen they use 8.6 (10 hours of vacations and 8 hours of sick days) days. (Working 5.5 days on vacation and 2.6 days on sick days)\n\nThe number of sick days left is the difference between vacation days used and the number of total vacation days (10 - 8.6 = 1.4 = 0.86).\n\nEach morning consists of 8 hours, each vacation day uses 5.5 hours, and each sick day uses 2.6 hours, so the number of hours remaining equals 8 (hours left in the year) * (5.5 (vacation day used per day)/8 (hours for a vacation day)) * (2.6 (sick day used per day)/1 (hours for a sick day)).\n\nSo, 8 * (5.5/8) * (2.6/1) = 141.6 days left.\n\nDays left can be used to calculate the number of hours.\n\nSo, 141.5 (# of sick days left) * (8.6 + 5.5 + 2.6) = 143.5 = 144.\n\nSo 144 hours = 10 vacation + 10 sick days (# of days given).\n\nHence, the answer is 144 hours.\n\n### Explanation\n\n#### Problem Breakdown\n\n1.

{"text": "The question presents a scenario where Gary earns overtime (where every extra hour after 40 is paid at a 1.5 times rate) in addition to his regular wage. Given this information, the goal is to calculate the number of hours worked by Gary in that week.\n\nThe first part of the question provides the total amount of Gary\u2019s paycheck before taxes. This amount is $696, which can be calculated as the total regular wage ($1200) multiplied by the overtime rate ($4/hr). \n\nThe overtime rate of 1.5 means that every extra hour after 80 (out of 40 in the total of 120 in a regular shift) is paid at a 50% discount of $2/hr. This means that the total number of hours worked (regular and overtime) can be calculated as follows:  \n$$Regular \\ \\times 80 = \\ 80 \\ + \\ Regular \\ \\times 1.5 = \\ 120 \\ + \\ Regualr \\times 2.0 =\\ 240 \\ + \\ 16 \\ + \\ 1.5 \\textrm{hours}$$\nFrom this calculation, it can be observed that the total number of regular hours worked comes out to be 1.5 times the overtime hours worked, which is 80 + (120 x 2).\n\nBased on the above calculation, Gary\u2019s total number of worked hours comes out to be 240. This amount can also be found by subtracting the regular pay from the total pay of $696. \n\n$$240 \\ - \\ 1200 \\ = \\ 696$$\n\nAs a result of this calculation, we can conclude that Gary\u2019s total number worked hours in that week is 240.\n\nAnswer: 240\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following history question.\n\n## Demonstration:Write a response that appropriately concludes the request by selecting one of the choices provided.\n\n## Input: Who was the first president of Russia?

{"text": "I do not understand what this question is trying to ask.\n\n### Rationale: It's important to analyze the structure of the question and break it down into separate components to understand what the question is asking.\n\n### Explanation: \n1. The question is about how many people would you would expect to play football out of 250 individuals. This would require determining the proportion of individuals who like football and who play football, and then applying that proportion to the total population to calculate the expected number of players.\n\n2. The given statistics describe the following proportion of individuals:\n  * 24 out of 60 individuals (40%) like football\n  * Out of those who like football, 50% (50 of 100) play football.\n\n3. Let's use these statistics to calculate the proportion of individuals who play football:\n  * 14 out of 65 individuals (21.5%) play football\n\n4. Now, let's apply the proportion of individuals who plays football to the 250 members in our group:\n  * 50 players out of 256 individuals play football.\n5. However, the question does not ask \"how many people would you expect to play football out a group of 200?\" instead it asks \"how many people are you expected to play football out of a total population of 250?\" Hence the correct response is : 50/250 which is 20%", "answer": " 50"}

The yellow is broken and can't move at all.  The blue can travel at a speed 80 mi/hr.  What is the speed that the red can travel? \n\n## Demonstration:  Answer\n\n## Answer: The red can travel at twice (100%) of the normal speed, while the green can travel at twice the normal speed for a second time(200%).  The yellow can't move at 100% of normal speed or 0% of normal speed.  The green car's speed is 200% of the normal speed, which is 2.61 times faster than the normal speed.  The blue car can travel 80%.  The answer is 2.6.\n\n### Rationales:We know that the normal speed that the blue car can travel to is 80 miles per hr which is 11.111 meters per second (11 m/s).\nWe are assuming 1 hr = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds.\nThe information we can get from the given questions is:\n1. The red car can travel at twice the rate of speed of the green car.\n2. The green car can travel at twice its rate of speed.\n3. The yellow one is broken so that it cannot travel at all.\n4. The blue car can travel at a speed at a rate of 80%.\nNow, to solve the question, we need to find the speed of the red car by setting the values of time, rate and speed.So, here,\n\\$v_{blue} = 0.80v_{car}\\$\n\nAnd,\n\n\\$v_{red} = \\frac{2}{2} \\cdot 2v^{\\prime}_{green} = v^{\\prime}_{green}\\ \\Rightarrow \\ v^{\\prime}_{green} \\cdot 2 = v^{\\prime}_{red} \\ \\Rightarrow\\ v^{\\prime}_{green}=\\frac{v^{\\prime}_{red}}{2} \\ \\Rightarrow \\ v^{\\ast}_{green}", "answer": " 1280"}

{"text": "1. The first thing we have to do to solve this exercise is to find out the profit that he makes when he sells one fish (not knowing which fish it is). Then, once we have that, we have to multiply it by the number of fish that he sold that day. Let that be 'x' and then the profit per each fish sold that day would be '$x'.\n2. We are already assuming in the question that his goal is to earn $5 from each trout and $4 for each blue gill. Therefore, when x = 6, the profit for trouts will be $30 and the profit for blue gills will be $24.\n3. Next we consider how many trouts and blue gills he sells that weekend. He can catch and sell up to 5 fish on weekends, so we know that 5 is the maximum number of fish sold. In the question \"If 60% were Trout and the rest being blue-gill\", we can understand that 60% of that 5 is Trouts. 1/0,60=1,66. Therefor, 166% (166/100= 1,66) of his total fish were trouts (60% of 5).\n4. Then, how many blue-gills did he sell? We know he sold 5 total fish (the maximum amount) and since 60% of the total fish were trouts, then 40% (40/100=0,4) remained as blue-gills.\n5. $30 is his profit per trout, so his profit from selling those trouts is 30*166/1,66= $20.\n6. Similarly $24 is the profit from blue-gill fishes, therefore his profit from selling that 5 blue-gills is 24*100/4= $6.\n7. Therefore. his profit is $20+$6=$6+$20=$36.\n8.

To answer this, first decide which chocolate bar you are looking at (out of the 100 bars).\n\n1. You can determine the number of each type chocolates in the box.\n2. The number of dark chocolate are 25 out of 100 and the number of milk chocolate bars are 25 out 100. The number of white and almond bars in the box is 25 out of a 100.\n\n3. The number of bars in the box is `25+25+25` or 100. So, the total number of bar to be sold is 100. \n\nTo get the percentage, we first need to divide the bars by 100 and then multiply the result by 100. You will also need to use the number of bars in the same type of chocolate.\n\nTo divide the bars by 25, you subtract the number of bars of one type from the total number of bars. For example the number of milk cholat is 25 out 25 +25 + 25 = 100. We have to subtract `25+2+2` from the total.  \n\nThe result of the division (total number of bars - number of one type of chocolate) is 75. \n\nIf we multiply and 25 we get 19.3, If we multiply and 75 we get 0.25.\n\nNow we can calculate the percentages of the bars.

So, using $15$ as their previous quantity of shells, in the second line of the prompt the prompt states \"Together (E+J)$= (13+1+2)$=$15$ shells\".\n\n7. Therefore, their next $1$ shell is $2$ shells.\n8. Hence, the total $15$ shells are $15 + (16)$ shells.\n9.

So, for a rise in temperature the water boiling point is going to change by 10\u00b0C.\n\n### Example 1: [Answer: 30, Output: 60]\n### Input:\"Every ten percent increase in the temperature, water\u2019s freezing point also rises by how many percent?\".\n### Rationale: Similar to above example \n\n### Example: [Answer: 99.99%, Output: 1,677,721\u00b0C]\n### Input: \"If every cent degree increase in Celsius increases by 1 degree in Fahrenheit, how high is the temperature in Fahrenheit when the freezing point in Celsius reaches -459.67 degree fahrenheit?\".\n### Solution: \n1. First solve for temperature in Fahrenheit with change in freezing point in Celcius. \n```\nif every cent degree increase in fahrenheit increases by $1$ degree in Celcius:\n$f(c) = \\frac{100c+459.66^\\circ f}{c-459.64^\\circ f}$\n$f(0.0) = 32.0\\deg {", "answer": " 15"}

The hats have 8 stripes for Vaishali plus the 4 hats with three stripes equaling 12 for a total of 20 stripes.  A common misconception is that the hats with stripes multiplied by their stripes is the total.  It turns of to be 15 plus one for a total of 16 (1st multiplied by 3rd and 2nd multiplied by 4th) instead of 11 minus six (2nd multiplied by second) which is the correct answer.

{"text": "He earned a profit of $2080;  $\\frac{1}{4}$*$4*7000=$2080\n### Why the answer is right\n\nIn this case the question is fairly easy due to the structure of the problem and the clear solution. There are several things that point to right answer that can be analyzed in this scenario.\n\n1. The prompt starts with asking James to buy 200 lottery tickets. From what is mentioned in the prompt, he has bought 200 tickets. This leaves the question, how much did he spend to have 200 tickers? He spent two dollars on each ticket. This is a simple calculation, which can be written as 2*200=$400.\n2. Next the prompt asks, what percentage is won by his ticket? This is quite simple, given this question, we can easily arrive at that 20% of his total purchased ticket are winners. This can be seen as follows:\n    * 200 ticketers *$2*100%= 200(2*$2)*(10)$*2$=$200*100*$2$=$400\n    * 1*400*$2=$800\n    *200*$2*100=$40*$200$=$200$2$=400$\n    * 2/5 of 400+ 200 dollars =400+100+20$=$620$\n3. Now the second part is stated, out of the total lottery tickets being won, 80% are winners that have a value of five dollars. This means that the total tickets which have a value of five is 80 percent of total tickets which means that there were a total of 25 tickets with a value of 5. This can be calculated as follows:\n    $ 400+(5/2)*25*2=$550+(5*10)*125=$812.50\n3. Lastly, the profit made is given as 20 dollars per ticket. This means that 80% of 200 tickters =160 ticketers, but only", "answer": " 4830"}

{"text": "The correct answer to this question is option C: $22.5.\n\nThe basic logic behind arriving at this answer is as follows:\n\n1. For the months from January to July, the saving is $10 per month.\n2. Multiplying 7 months with $10 gives us a total of $70 for this period.\n3. The months from August to November, the saving increases by 50% (from $10 to $15 per month).\n4. This leads to the total savings for the eight months from 01 January to 31 October being $100.\n5. Since, according to the question we want to save $150 for the whole year, $25 is needed from November to December.\n6. Therefore, to get the final amount, we multiply $70 x 2 (months from Jan-Nov), and $25 (months from Nov-Dec). This gives us $175.\n7. Now, we can add the totals for the two periods (i.e. $100 + $175). So, the final, correct answer is $275.\n8. The most plausible answer for the question, however, is option C: $15 x 2 (month-wise). This gives us $30.\n9. So (a) the final answer has to be $150 or more.\n10. As we can see, options C, D, and E all add up to more than $125.\n11. However, $22.5 is closest to the target amount ($150) among the options.\n12. Option D is not true as it leads to a total less than $125 ($117.5 to be specific), since the period for which saving rate increased, was only 1 month and not 7 months.\n13. Option E is not true as it ends up giving a negative savings ($17.5), since the saving amounts to $15 x $2 instead of $15 x $3.\n14.

{"text": "Lily has $55\n\n### Rationale: 1. As per the provided question, 'How much money is left in lily's account?'. We can notice that in the given question, we don't have the starting fund or value.\n2. We can see that she spends $50 after she purchases the shirt, so we can assume that she must have bought the shirt for $7, and whatever was left of her fund was spent in the third shop.\n3. Now we have to find the value of 'thrice as much as a shirt' in the question.\n4. Since we don't know what was spent in the first two phases, we can consider that it must have been in the order of $25 since the final sum should be $25 if she purchases $25 in the third shop and is left with $30, so that makes us believe that the answer is $125.\n5. Since that is not an integer value, the answer will always be rounded to the nearest integer, which means, Lily will still have $55 in her bank account.\n\n###\n\n### Instructions: What kind of information is required to complete the instruction?\n\n### Demos:\n### Input: She asked the customer two specific questions.

Choices: \tA: 6 feet B: 7 feet C: 8 feet D: 9 feet E: 10 feet\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The length of snake is described as \"In the woods\".\n2. This implies that the snake is hiding or in shade rather than in the sun.\n3. Since the sunlight is likely to cause direct UV damage the snake probably uses shade to mitigate its damage. Sunlight can also heat up the snake's skin damaging it as well.\n4. So snake is looking for or seeking shade. It can't simply be in the sun and have its light source be the sunlight or the shade is simply there but not under the snake.\n5. So, looking at options, option E: \"10 feet\" is excluded as the distance from UV rays is too long the snake must be in some form of shade to sustain itself as long.\n6. Looking at options that are in a shaded setting, Option B: \"7 feet\" and Option D: \"9 feet\" are both ruled out as this is not enough shade to sustain the snake. \n7. This narrows down the answer to A: 6 feet and C: 7 feet which has the snake in \"6 feet\" of shade and is still hidden from the sun with 1 foot not shaded to avoid excessive sun damage.\n8.

{"text": "If Brendan cuts 8 yards per day with the lawnmower and he bought it to cut 50 percent more yards per day, he would be able to cut 13 yards per day. He has cut a total of 98 yards per week.\n\n\n### Analysis:\nThe first two paragraphs give numbers about Brendan's grass cutting performance. The third paragraph implies that he bought a new lawnmower that enables him to cut even more grass. To conclude, the forth paragraph gives a statement that he has cut a total of a hundred and thirty six yards per week.\nThe answer should be a single number from the given choices that explains a possible yardage, based on the given information from the text.\n### Instruction Answer:\nTo answer this question, we need to apply some basic math. The first paragraph states that Brendan can cut 1 yard of grass per day. But then after he bought the lawnmower that is able to cut his grass by 50%, the answer is able to cut 1.5 yards per day. There's a total of seven days a week. So, the answer should be added up to 1.5 yards. 1.5 yards (or 0.75 meters) is the answer to the question asked.\nAnswer: 1.5 yards\n\n### Solution 2:\nThe first two lines state that Brendan can make 8 yards of grass cut each day by using the blade of grass. The next phrase shows that he bought the lawn mower so he wouldn't have to use his blade of grass and it helped him to have a 50% faster cut. There is also the last phrase that says he has cut 13 yards of grass per day after he bought the blade.\nThe answer should include number of yards per day and time in a week. That is why the last question shows that the given numbers and time Brendan cut the grass per week with 100% accuracy to the given choices.\nThe math to calculate the total number of yards is 13\u00d77=91\nAs an alternative method, the time can 13 minutes per day, and then in each week it could have been 10 hours or 70 in total.\n\n### Solution in Ruby:\n```ruby\ndef brendan_answer", "answer": " 84"}

Choices: 1: water for bathing 2: towels and soap 3: tub 4: bubbles 5: bathroom\nRationales:1. To start, we have been given a scenario where the person is looking for a bathroom.\n2. \"Expect\" in the question can be seen as a context that hints at a particular outcome based on actions being performed.\n3. We can determine there is likely to be something related to \"bathing\" as the action performed. \n4. Therefore, it is appropriate to find the action of \"bathing\" among the options provided.\n5. Option \"cleaning your hair\" is not possible as it's not a specific action of bathing.\n6. Option \"tooth brushing\" doesn't match the context of a bathroom as the bathroom isn't used for brushing, it's for bathing.\n7. Option \"dining\" doesn't match either since it's not a relevant action performed in a bathroom.\n8. Consequently, only options A: water for bathing and B: bathing and soap are specific actions of bathing.\n9. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is B: bathing and soaps.\n10. Finally, in the context of the given question, \"water for bathing\" implies that there is water for bathing.\n11. Similarly, \"bathroom\" indicates there is likely a bathroom found in the area. Therefore, the final answer would \"a bath room containing water, towels, soap, and possibly bubbles\",  or simply \"a bath\".\n12.

In this question, let us consider the question 'A home run is when a batter hits the ball and then the ball travels at what?'\n2. 'At least' signifies the minimum required so that a home run can be called. So, let us focus on the minimum.\n3. Now consider choice A: '200 mph', choice B: '350 mph', choice C: '500 mph', and choice D: '1 foot'.\n4. Choice A is less than the minimum of '200 m', so it is not the minimum that a home run requires.\n5. Similarly, choice B is also below '200 m'.\n6. Next, choice C is above '200 m' so it will not cause a home run.\n7. Lastly, choice D is a distance rather than a speed. So, it doesn't satisfy the minimum distance requirement that a home run needs, so it can be eliminated.\n8. Therefore the minimum speed that will cause a home run is at least '200 m/h', so the answer is B: 351 mph.\n9.

{"text": "Zion is the most likely to be correct because he says that the area is equal to the width of the top of the triangle. The other option is incorrect because their reasoning might be incorrect and/or it only gives a small percentage of the total area of the triangle.\n\n### Explanation: \n\nThe answer is 'Zion', but there's a lot to break down here.\n\nThe prompt here is the word problem style that states Zion built a triangular-shaded home with a base width of 40 cm and a height of 10 cm while the other two friends built similarly shaped homes. Because Zion alone built the triangular home, he will therefore be incorrect.\n\nThe correct answer choice is 'Zion' because that's the only reason we're asked, but the other choice is also a possibility for the same reasoning.\n\nThe other choice (the one to pick) can be eliminated because it's too small, given that the question asks for the total area of all three homes, not just two.\n\nBecause the base of the triangle was 40 cm and the height was 20 cm, the top of the triangle was also 40 cm wide (40 cm * 20 cm * 2) cm (10 inches x 20 inches * 2 inches = 100 inches).\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following science question.\n\n## Demonstration: Instructions are listed under each task (e.g., Answer the following chemistry question).\n\n### Task: 1\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: In what kind of environment will a cell experience a high degree of resistance?

{"text": "The question in the prompt describes a scene in which Maria, a child, cracked open a pinata with one mighty blow. The description then goes on to list the candies in various colors (red, yellow, blue) that were left over after Maria's blow.\n\nIn response to the question of how many candies remained, we can provide a rational explanation for our choice of answer. We'll first consider the color counts, and then we'll consider the fraction of blue candies remaining.\n\n### Option A: 20 (0 * 0 * 40 + 10 * 1 + 5 * 1)\n\nThe statement in the problem refers to candies spilled \"all over the floor\", so any candies remaining after the blow that Maria made would be on the floor. \n\nBecause Carlos ate all of Carlos' candies, we are left with the original candy count, plus 10 fewer red, yellow, and blue candies. \n\nTherefore, we have 40 total candies left, of which 20 remain red; 10 remain yellow; and 5 remain blue.\n\n### Answer: A: 20\n\n### Option B: 40/3 = 13/3\n\nThe logic behind the method presented by the question is to take the ratio of blue candies remaining to blue candies eaten.  \n\nIn order to do this, we need to divide the original total of blue candies by the quantity of blue candies that Carlos ate.\n\nWe can do this via ratio, meaning that there is more than one object or quantity being compared, and therefore, a relationship between the quantities is implied.  \n\nThe ratio used in this example is the same as if we were dividing two fractions: two fractions of the same denominator. Fractions can also be compared to each other by this method.  \n\nTo explain this method, we can also use addition (adding the ratio for each color) \n\nThe result of this addition method is equal to dividing the total by the sum of the ratios.\n\n### Answers: Option B & Option C: 13/3 and 15/3, respectively, are equal to 4.33 and 4.67, respectively\n\n### Option D:", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": "Patsy needs to make 2 dozen more appetizers according to the 9 dozen that have been made.\n\n### Rationale\n1. First, let's look at each appetizer alone to understand it better.\n2. We see that deviled eggs take 6 eggs each, but kabob and pig in a blanket both take 12 appetizers each. Therefore, with 9 dozen appetizers made, there are 18 left to make.\n3. For 2 more dozen, we need to increase our total appetizers by twice 18 \u2014 54 more appetizers are needed.\n4. Since 9 dozen appetizer are made from 3 egg, 2 pig in a blankets and 2 kabob.\n5.

{"text": "The total is 1 hour plus 5:30 minutes.\n\n### Detailed Solution:\n\nInput/Output: The total is 1 hour and 5:30. To be able to get to 1 hour (plus 5:30), multiply all the times by 2. So, if clean the house takes 7 hours and if all things to do to take a bath takes 1 hours, we will have 14 hours. If all things to do to make the dinner take 4 hours we will have 18 hours. Now we have to go by these times. We have 7\u00d72+1=14. We also have 1\u00d72+1=2+1=3. Now we multiply 18x2=36. So, we can find the sum as 52+36+14=100. Now we find remainder.

Given that the business is Grace\u2019s own, she would be the one to maintain the ledgers and track her revenue over time.\n3. In the initial column, each hour is represented by a single digit.\n4. The hours that Grace mowed lawns is 63, the hours that she pulled weeds is 9 and the hours that she put down mulch is 10.\n5. For each column, the wage per hour for the particular job is listed at a specific order as A, B, and C.\n6. Taking the first column, there are a total of 63 hours spent in lawn mowing service.\n7. For each row, the salary per hour for the service of lawn mowing is $6, meaning that she earned $135 for 63 hours spent on lawn mowing.\n8. Next, we analyze the second column of Grace\u2019s table and notice two of the values at 6 and 1 for weed-pulling services. Each of these values indicates Grace worked 6 and 1 hours in that column\u2019s task, respectively.\n9.

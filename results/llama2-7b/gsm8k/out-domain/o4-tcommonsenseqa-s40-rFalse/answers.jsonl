We can do this easily by using a `data` class.\nFirst, create a class named `InputClass1` in which you put the function and the parameter `data` (`public` and `static`):\n```\npublic static void calculate(int data) {\n  // do some basic math\n}\n```\nThen create a class named `DataClass` that holds `data` and its type `int`, as well as other attributes:\n```\nprivate int _data;\n\n// all the rest of the code must be static and public\nstatic int _i;\npublic int ID { get; set; }\n```\nAnd finally, create a class named InputClassTest from which you inherit from InputClass1, and add the `data` parameter to its constructor:\n```\npublic class InputClassTest: InputClass1{\n  // the constructor must be public, and add the parameter\n  public int _data;\n}\n```\nAfter we did everything, create a class named OutputClass, and inherit from `OutputClassTest`. This is because you need, for the `PrintClass` class, also to inherit from `Output` class.\nFirst create a class named `OutputClassTest`:\n```\npublic class OutputClassTest: Output{\n\n  // we can delete everything that comes after here (OutputClassTest: Output)\n  // the only thing we need is the constructor\n  public OutputClassTest() { }\n}\n```\nWe need the `constructor` because the constructor is how the object of a class inherits from another class. Then we make an `OutputClass` that inherits from OutputClassTest:\n```\npublic OutputClass: OutputClassTest {\n  // construct the class\n}\n```\n\nNow you can create methods that add a new object of the class you made. You can do this because the public methods in your constructor (OutputClass) that are part of the private members of the class (OutputClassTest) become public.", "answer": " 49200"}

The strawberries take up 2 square feet so that leaves 1/4 for the fruit which leaves you with 10/4 = 2.5 that gives you 2 1/4 but that's too long, so you get 20 to make everything equal.\n\n**I would put in a little more explanation...**\n3.

They are included here to help you understand our specifications.\n\n\n\n\n### Solution:\n\nThis function takes in a \"word\", which is an input of characters, as an input to our regexr. It then takes the input through regexr to remove spaces and to then to add the space after the first character in whatever our input is. The regexr function is:\n\n`var input = input.replace(/\\s/, '')`\n\n`var lastChar = input.charAt(input.length - 1);`\n\n`var spaces ='';  `\n\n`if(letter === letter.toUpperCase()){ spaces+='S'}`\n\n`if(lastChar + letter!== letter.toUpperCase()){spaces +='S'}`\n    \n`if (letter === \"z\"){ spaces = spaces.replace(/S/g, \"ZZ\"); input =spaces + input}else {spaces + letter;}`\n\n`  input = spaces + input `\n\nWe can see above that what regexr function does is run through and check if our input is an uppercase letter, if we have an uppercase letter that isn't the final character in our input regexr calls a method to replace \"s\" with \"S\".\n```\n\nAnother method that we use is to set a variable to check if inputted lowercase letters are in succession.

They went off into the beautiful summer sunshine on foot, riding their bikes, or on skateboards. Each child was carrying at least one small satchel with their books, and possibly textbooks, their lunches in containers, and maybe even a ball or some toys.

He didn't know that Tom had also forgotten the toys they had planned on playing with. He was just glad to be out of school.\n\nThe third paragraph\nSarah was a little disappointed when she found that her friends had forgotten the toys they planned to play with, so early on in the holiday. She started to walk home. It was a very pleasant day, but just then, a beeping noise caught her ear. She didn't recognize it as a phone or TV, or an alarm. Someone was ringing a bell, she suddenly realized. It was the church. It was too late to go to the services, but she started to walk there anyway. The church bells were so beautifully played, and the air was fresh outside. It smelt of flowers, and the lawn was mowed, so it felt like the whole neighborhood had just come in from the yard work. She was happy that the church was ringing for the first day of summer vacation.\n\nThe fifth paragraph\nIt was now well into the afternoon, and Nate decided to drive across town to his brother's house.

We recommend that you use a web-based SQL editor to submit your\nassignment, which will allow you to try the examples out (see the resources on the\nCourse website for instructions on how to use different editors).\n\nComplete your assignment by executing each SQL Statement through an SQL editor. You\nwill provide a link to your work as an assignment submission.\n\nWe recommend that you take some time before you start by carefully reading the SQL\nStatement examples under Exercise 7.1 in Chapter 7 of the textbook.\n\nAfter you are comfortable with the Exercise 7 assignment, begin to practice each of\nthe SQL statement examples. Make sure you test each SQL statement with a dummy\ndata set. If your application requires an account or is too sensitive to run against\ndata that you do not own, we recommend that you create dummy data using a\ntext-editing tool (e.g., vim, emacs, notepad, word). This allows you to practice\nwriting the SQL statement without fear of writing over your own data (or anyone\nelse\u2019s data).\n\nThen, move on to the second SQL statement from the book. Continue with this process\nuntil you have reviewed all of the SQL statements from the book.\n\n## Instrucions:\n\nYou should start with the SQL Exercises from Chapter 7. (This exercise uses the same SQL statements as Exercise 7.) Then you should practice all of the SQL statements in Chapter 8, and Chapter 9. Finally, you should practice the SQL statement exercises from Chapter 10.\n\nIf you\u2019ve reviewed all of the exercises in the book then, you can then start writing your own\nnew SQL statements on the assignment.\n\n# Grading Rubric\n\nTo determine the grade, we will use the 100 points grading rubric.

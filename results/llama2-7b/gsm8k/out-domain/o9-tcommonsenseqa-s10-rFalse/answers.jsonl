Then implement it in the method named as per the instruction above.\n\n### NOTE:  It's more about how you solve it instead of the answer. You need to explain your approach and include the math logic with it.\n\n### Example Solution \n\nWe have 720 as the problem's start value.\n\nDay 1: The person started reading 12 page\nDay 2: The person can read 24 pages\n\nBecause the current page is 120 + 24 = 144. So they can only read 144 pages which is 120% of 144 = 168\n\nDay 3: The person should be able to read 5/7 pages.\n\nSo in day 3 the person should be able to finish remaining 171 pages left minus half of 168 pages which was 61 pages\n\nThere will be 171 - 61 = 110 pages left\n\nNow if you do 110 % 144\nYou'll get 0.83 pages left \n\nI think you're good to go after this point\n\n0) 0 1) 45 2) 66\n\n# Input: What is the difference between the following measurements?\n\nChoices: inches, miles\n\nOutput: miles\n\nInput:How many pieces of metal cut into 5 different lengths?\n\n# Choices: 3 50 100 2\n\nOutput:3\n\n# Input: 3 people are planning to run 1 million metres.\n\n# Choices:# 0 000 000\n\nOutput:-\n\n### Instructions:\n\nIt is a coding exercise about how we can efficiently use a while loop with some conditions.\n\nLet say we have a variable \"distance\" which value will add up to 100,000,00 in 200 iterations.\n\nIn a while loop, we try to add one (1) digit into the distance.

{"text": "37.58 mph [37.48 rounded]\n\nInput: A train is moving at a certain speed. During the trip it stops to pick up and drop off one hundred passengers. How far does the train travel? The passengers and crew on the train don't count.\nOutput: 285 miles round\n\nPlease ignore answer below:\nInput: 384.9 385\nOutput: 385 rounded\n\n### Instruction:Answer the grade math question.\n**The train is 385 miles long when it has a full crew and passengers but its length becomes 384.6 when it is only carrying passengers and no crew.  How long would the train length be if the crew would ride along the train with the passenger?**\n\nAnswer: First let us calculate how many passenger does this train carry. This train has 100 passengers. So 6 passengers per the rail car length (384.9*6 =2138).\n\nNow lets consider that the crew is on 40% of the total rail car. So the crew will travel on 0.4*384.6 = 153.8 of the rail car.\nNow passengers on remaining 60% can be carried on the same length of the train as the train is 384.4*6 = 2304. (As 2304 -2138 =166 and 100/166 = 0.6 )\n\nSo finally we have to add 153.4 of rail car for crew and 6*0.6 = 36.\n\nSo we will have a total length of the train = 2340", "answer": " 58"}

{"text": "4\n\n### Explanation:We know that the company made 4 miles of pitch on the first day, and it took 3 truckloads of asplift to cover each mile of paving. So they have used 12 truckloads of pitch the first day.\n\nSo the last day, they have to make 8 * 3 = 24 m, which means that they have to make 16 more miles.\nWe know that 2 bags of gravel are used for every truckload of asphalt, so it takes:\n```bags_of_pitch*trips_to_pave_pitch+bags_of_gravel*(trips_that_use_gravel /trips_to_load_of_asphalt)```.\nNow we know that every truckload of gravel requires 5 truckloads of ashlift.\nSo we can conclude that every truckload can use 5/trips_that_uses_gravel bags of gravel.\nLet's calculate:\n```\nbags_of_asphat*trips_that_used_asphat + bags_of_grave * (5/trips) = 2 x (bags_of_agavell*5/trips).\n```\nso the last day they have to make:\n```\n(trips_used/trips_to_fill)*(bags_of_ashafat*trips_of_ashaflt + bags_of gravel * (5/trip)/trip)\n=\n(bags_of gravel/trips_used)*(bags_ashaft / trips_used+ 5/trips_*trips_that_using_gravel)\n=\n((bags_gravel*7)/ trips*5) / 6\n=\n(banks gravel * 7 /6) / 45\n=\n(bag of gravel * 21/24) / 45 =\n(1/2) bags of gravel / 45 =2/24 = 1\n```\nThe answer is the last question.", "answer": " 6"}

How does the answer change if you add the word \"baby\" to the end of \"one year of age\"? \nOutput: True\n\nInput: We'll be happy to give you an answer today or have you call back when it's convenient. The same can be said of having patience. Which means it can't mean today is convenient to call back. Can patience be had? Patience must be taken, though having patience requires that it not be taken, and that seems like having patience would make it less convenient to give patience, but it makes sense to take patience, and it can't be had. That's a lot of patience for today. I'm having patience just writing all that. If we don't have patience, are we impatient? Patience is patient, and if that is the case, then we are having patience with patience for patience is patient. Patience is the only patient we're capable of having, except that even if patience isn't patient, we can have patience with patience being patient, and patience is only patient after having patience, which really means that that patience is patient after having some patience. So, I'll have patience, but I'm having patience as I wait for patience to have patience. I can have patience after I wait to have patience. Is it easier to have patience, or to wait to have it?", "answer": " 300"}

This room is called an n-dimensional room. If we know the number of dimensions, n, as the dimensions' lengths do not need to be known. Then by making the floor have length n-1 units, the ceiling will have an n-2 units of length. The walls will be 2 n-3 units long and will be at a height of exactly n-3 units from the floor. The ceiling will not hang from below the ground floor or will not rest on the ground floor. If x represents the length of a wall and y represents the height (distance from the floor to the ceiling) of a wall, then each wall will have length x and height y, with y being a function of x. This could also be written x and y, with y being the value x represents.\nOutput: y = x - n - 2\n\nInput: Length and height represent a plane that we can draw. The width represents the depth of that plane. By definition, the depth and height of a block in your hand is 10 mm, in other words, one cube mm.

After spending a year with the Krusty Krew, Squidward the employee discovers a mistake in Mr. Krabs's budget.

If it needs to make a $18.40 gross profit on each unit, how many units should be sold to meet its net income target of $257,041 for the year?\nOutput: The company's selling price is higher than its variable cost but that is wrong. So we do $63.5/$125 = 0.5 or 50% of margin. It means the company needs to keep its selling price 50% of its variable cost. We now check the selling price of $125 is 50% of the variable cost. So the selling price must be equal to the variable cost. You can write the variable cost as $63.5 x 0.5 (this time you have to divide it by 2 because it is a fraction). That is $31.75. The selling price is fixed by the company. So the company must lower its selling price to the variable cost of $31.76. The $18.4 margin would remain the same when it is $31.80. So $31.8 x 60 = 1908. The company needs 1908 units to meet its selling price and its profit target.", "answer": " 3"}

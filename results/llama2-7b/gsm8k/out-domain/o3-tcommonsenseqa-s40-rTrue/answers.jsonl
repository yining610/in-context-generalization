{"text": "The first thing to note is that the ticket costs $40, and Mr. Benson bought $12 tickets. To calculate the discount, you need to subtract $5 per 12 tickets bought. In this case, Mr. Benson bought more than 10 tickets so he received a discount of $10 on every 12 tickets. The total cost of tickets is calculated by multiplying the number of tickets by the ticket price. Here, 12 multiplied by 40 is 480. Then, Mr. Benson receives a discount that reduces the total cost by 10% (0.10) times 480, which is $48.\nMr. Benson saves $5 per every 12 ticked bought but he also saves $10 on every extra 12 ticket purchase.

So, the amount of water before she tripled the water in it must be counted.\n7 - This is because Nancy triples the water in the aquarium, which means she needs to fill it one and a half times as full as when she initially filled it. Thus, she needs to put in one and a half times the amount of water originally in the aquarium.\n8 - However, by that logic, we'd need to factor in the volume of water she added in the middle, i.e. after the aquarium was initially filled.\n9 - Nancy initially fills the aquarium; then she adds 10 more, which means she originally added 20 cubic feet into the aquarium.\n10 - Now, after Nancy tripled the water in the aquarius, we have 3 times the number of water which was originally in it, i.e. 3 x 20 = 60. 60 cubic feet.\n11 - We can subtract this from the amount of water in total the aquarium has after it is trippled, i.e. (1 + 2 + 3) x 20. 80 cubic feet.

{"text": "Given the information in this question, we can formulate and analyze the following equation:\n\nCan Price = $110\nPer Person Price = $5\nCans = 45\n\nThe first and most important step is to understand the equation given. The per person price and number of cans indicate that these two individuals are shopping together as individuals when buying the milk. From there, it is possible to use the variables and constants given in the problem to solve for the unknown value in the equation.\n\nNext, consider the information given about both Jennifer and Mark and work through the equations to find values for each variable given. To begin, we know the number of cans purchased by each individual because Jennifer is 6 cans behind of Mark, which means that Mark is more than 6 cans ahead of Jennifer. We then multiply the number of cans bought by $5 per can to understand the overall price by dividing both parts of the equation and getting $225 (cost) and $22.5(cost per unit). We also know Jennifer spent a total of $50 more than Mark. Using these amounts, we can plug the cost per unit and total price into the equation to find the individual cost.\n\nThe next step is to plug the number of cans into the equation given. We first start off by finding how much money did each individual spend. We start with mark, by subtracting his initial cost given from his total cost spent. We then come to,\n\n$225 - m + $50 = $225 - m\n\nThe next step would be to find the number of cans Mark purchased by taking the difference between the total cost spent by mark and the money spent by $5. In this instance, mark is $85 below what he actually spent and spent a total of $310, which leads to:\n\n85 - $5 = -$85 and $310 - $85 = $225\n\nThe next step when plugging in cans is finding the number of cans purchases by either individual. There are a few ways to do this, but we will use the equation:\n\nx*price = total of the purchases by mark\n\nWe then use this equation to plug in the total of cans Mark bought and find the equation for each individual\u2019s total purchases.

{"text": "1: 1. The problem asks about the amount of money saved for a trip by Sally and Bob, so the solution must include their wages from babysitting as well as how long they will be working and how much each person earns.\n2. The question states that at the end of the day, Sally makes $6 and Bob makes $4, which suggests that $6 and $4 are daily earnings rather than a weekly or monthly income.\n3. With this information, we can calculate that in a year, Sally will bring in a total of $2,160 and Bob will bring in a total $1,440.\n4. Let us first calculate the monthly earnings. Sally's daily earnings of $6 multiplied by 25 days per month is $150. Bob's daily earnings multiplied by the 30 days per month come out to be $120.\n5. Adding the two numbers together leads to a total monthly income of $270 for Sally and $240 for Bob. At the end of a year, this would result in a grand total of $3,240 for Sally and a total $3,360 for Bob. \n6. If they save half of what they make, it means their wages are not the only variable in the question. They both save equal amounts, so the amount they are saving would not be the solution.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is D: $3,245 for Sally and $3,282 for Bob.\nSo the final answers is D: $3245 and D: $3282\n\n\nInput:If someone has 2 pairs of shoes and buys a third pair, how many shoes does he have altogether?\nOutput:  In a year, the two brothers hunted game.

{"text": "1st:\n3. When it comes to the first part of the question, we are given that Henry took 9 pills each day, and we are asked to calculate how much he spent in total.\n4. Looking at the available options:\n5. The first choice is that Henry spent $9 per day, but this could be wrong since if all the pills he took were the ones with $5.50 price tag then he spent nothing extra. The second choice of $9*14 doesn't make sense since if all the pennies had the same price he wouldn't have taken the 9th pill, just because it would cost an extra penny. So the answer is false.\n6. The third choice is that Henry spent \"$150\" which could be an estimate since he probably would have skipped some pills. This choice is also unsuitable since the 3rd pill in the 9th day would have cost $1.51. This question is also asking for a precise figure, and $150 provides an inaccurate and imprecise answer.\n7. The fourth choice is $1, which is the closest to the true answer. If a person took 9 pills, and all of them were taken with the $5.50 tag, then he would have spent exactly $1 for his pills.\n8th : When it comes to the second part of the question, to figure out Henry's total spending on pills:\n9. We need to understand that for 14 days, Henry took 9 pints as mentioned in the first part of the sentence. Hence, he spent exactly $1.\n10. Therefore, option 4: $1 is the right answer.\nSo the final and correct answer is 4.

One way to tackle this question and determine the total weight of sugar sold by the given store is to first multiply the number of packets sold with the weight of one packet.\nWe can use the equation: Packets * Weight = Total Weight.\n2. In this case, we are given that there are 20 packets sold each week, and each packet weighs 100 grms.\n3. Therefore we can write: Packets(20) * Weight(100g) = Total weight in kg.\n4. This equation simplifies to: Packets(2kg) = Total weight in Kg.\n5. When we divide the 'Total weight' by the 'packets' sold, we get 1kg.\n6.

{"text": "1. The first thing to note is that the total number of positive Coronavirus cases is 2000, including 500 new cases on the second day and 1500 new cases with 200 recovered cases on the third day.\n2. The second thing to note is that there is a trend in which the number of new cases is increasing, but the number of recoveries is also increasing.\n3. This suggests that the infection rate is generally decreasing, as more people are recovering and fewer people are becoming infected.\n4. Additionally, it is crucial to note that the number of new cases on the second and third day is not known, as we are only given the information of the total number of positive results recorded after the third day. Moreover, the number of recoveries recorded on each day is not necessarily the same number of positive cases that were reported that day.\n5. Instead, the number of positive cases recorded on the third day should be adjusted to include both the positive cases recorded after the second day and also the number of recoveries from the previous day, which can be calculated by subtracting the number of recovered cases on the second day from the total number of positive case recorded on the first day.\n6. Finally, the number of positive results after the third day can be calculated by adding the total number of positive tests after the second day and subtracting the total number of positive recoveries on both the second and third days. \n7. Hence, the final answer is 2800, which is the total number of positive COVID-19 cases after the third day.\nSo the final outcome is 280", "answer": " 3750"}
{"text": "Yesterday, David and William attended a party, where it is clear that David broke two glasses while William broke four times as many glasses as David did.\n1. The total number of glasses used equals David and William added together, which is known as the combined total.\n2. We can easily determine that the combined total is 4 (1+4), because the total number of glasses David used was 2, while the number of glasses William used was 4.\n3. The total number of broken glasses divided by the combined total is the per capita usage of the glasses, which in this case is 4/4 = 1.\n4. So, we can conclude that 1 glass was broken for every two people present at the party.\n5. The question then asks how many glasses were broken.\n6. Now, we know that David used 2 glasses altogether, while William used 4, which equals 6 glasses total in all, which means we need to subtract 2 from 6, which results in 4 glasses being broken.\n7. So, the final answer is 4, as the total combined number of glasses used equalled the per-capita usage, which was 1 for every two people at the party.\n8. Subsequently, it is 1 glass per two people times the number of individuals attending the party, which equals 2 glasses total for David and 6 glasses total for William, which are then reduced by the number of glasses used (2 and 4), resulting 4 glasses breaking in total.\n9. So we can conclude that 4 glasses were broken in total at the given party attended by David and William.\nSo the final and the correct answer is 4, 4 of David and 1 of William\n\nInput: I like shopping because it is very relaxing for me.

If a person running also at a constant speed takes 120 minutes to run 20000m, then a fox would take almost 6 times as much time to run 20Km.

This means that he bought a total of 12 cards in total.\n5. However, we have to look at what it means to answer the question, the question asks for the total cost of the boy's cards, not each card individually.\n6. We have to remember the meaning of the word total when it comes to understanding this question. Total is the sum of all parts, the combination.\n7. As a result, to answer this question, we have to take the total cost of each box, then add the total cost of each of the boxes to get the total cost of the 6 cards from each cardbox the boy bought.\n8. The cost of each box is 1.25 * 6 cards from that box 1.75 * 6 cards to the other box, so the total cost of the first box is $7.50 and the total cost of the second box is $10.50.\n9.

{"text": "1: This is a question of mathematical problem-solving, and the solution will be presented in a tabular form. To answer this question, the first step is to determine the total number of scarves that May will be able to make using the given information:\n2 red yarns * (3 scarves per 1 yarn) = 6 scarves, 6 blue yarn * (3 scarves) = 18 scarves, and 4 yellow * (3 scarves 1 yarn) * 4 = 12 scarves\nTo calculate the total number of scarfs that May can make, we need to add together the totals of all three categories: 6 + 18 + 12 = 36 scarves. So, May can make a total of 36 scarves in total.\n\n\nInstruction(10): Solving the problem above using 4 different methods\nOutput:1: This problem can be solved using the 3 following methods:\na. The first method is substitution: We can substitute the given variables in place of the number of scarves May can make. For example, for the blue yarns, we can substitute the number 6 with `b`. Therefore,\nb = 6 * (3 scarves / 1 yarn)\nb = 6*3 = 18\nWe can do the same for the other two yarns, `r` and `y`, and substitute their values too.\nr = 2 * (3 scarves/ 1 yarn) i.e., r = 2*3 = 6\ny = 4 * (3 scarves./1 yarn) i e, y = 4 *3 = 12\na. Therefore, the total number of scarf that may knit using all the given yarns are `b + r + y` which is equal to 18 + 6 + 12 =36.\n\nb. Another way to answer this question would be using mathematical operations:\n\n36 / 3 = 12, that means May will be making 36 div 3, it equals 12 scarfs.\nIt is a common way to answer multiple choice questions.\n\nc.

{"text": "1. The problem in this question is to determine the number of pages necessary for Punger to hold the cards he collected, considering the 60 packs and 7 cards per pack.\n2. The first step is to determine the number in each pack, which is 7.\n3. Once we know this, we have to multiple the number in the pack by the number of packs to get the number in the total.\n4. Since there are one pack and 7 cards per box, the number of cards in a single box is equal to 1 * 7 = 7.\n5. The next step is to determine the total number of cards he collected with the information provided. In this case, it would be equal to 60 * 7 = 420 cards.\n6. Now we can move on to the part about protecting the cards by using special pages.\n7. The card-protecting pages must contain 10 cards per page. If we multiply the number of cards with 10, we obtain the total amount of cards that Punger needs to protect with those pages.\n8. For this part, the question does the math for us, saying each card requires 10 pages. This means that we will divide the total number of cards, in this case, 420, by ten, which will allow us to find the number of pages that Punger needs in this scenario. The answer is 42, since we divided by ten, the answer will be 42.\n9. Finally, after considering the total number of cards that Pung er is looking to protect with special pages, the most correct answer is 42.\nSo the final answe is 42.", "answer": " 42"}

Then, the farmer have to feed both his horses, so there should be 3 bales that is required for every horse. Hence, he would need to know how many horses he owns to calculate how much bales of hay he has left.\n3) Let's assume that he owns 9 horses\n4) Since the phrase \"if he start feeding\" indicates that it is after hay would get harvested, we wouldn't be able to calculate how much bale(s) of hay would be left if the farmer start feeding his horses on the first day of September. That is because he can't figure out how many bales of harvested hay he should have left after calculating how much he will be feeding. Hence, we can't really make any conclusions from his current state right now of September.\n5) This further proves that we should only consider the amount of grass hay he will have harvested from the year itself instead \n6) If we take that into account, then the farmer will have 1060 bales of grass hay left from the year itself.\n7) For that to happen, he would harvest 560 bale from 5 acres of land each month for 10 months of the year.\n8) Let's assume he didn't harvest grass hay from his entire land, so he will leave the additional fields with the hay.

{"text": "1.'The sales' is a noun phrase that refers to the total number of books sold by Tina. In other words, the phrase refers to the total number or quantity of books.\n2. To understand the question properly, we must first understand that the number of books sold is equal to the total profit.\n3. This means that the sale price of each book is $20, and the cost of producing each book is $5. To calculate the number of people that Tina has sold the books to, we divide the total profit of $120 by the cost of each book ($5).This gives us a number of $24, meaning that she sold the books to 24 people. In conclusion, each book costs $5 and every customer gets 2 at a time.\n4. Let us understand this with a little example. Let's assume Tina sells $20 books to $10 million people. So her profit is $10 million.\n5. If a child sells it to his parent, it would cost $100,000 to produce. So it is essential to understand the number of children.\n6.

At the time of their arrival, he was busy and left a haystack untied.  In what way should have untied haystack be tied to achieve the best results for maximum gain? Choices: 1) A: He should have used a knot so tight that he would have had difficulty tying it. 2) B: He should have used as few knots as possible. 3) C: He should have tighter knots. 4) D: He should have used the simplest knot. 5) E: He should have used less knots.\nOutput: 1: A, B, C, and D\n2. As the story specifies the number of knots used in the making of hay (30), it's most feasible to assume that they were all equal. This implies that even 30 simple knots in this scenario couldn't possibly be tied \"so tight that he would have difficulty tying it\", so that answer doesn't make any sense.\n3. Knots that are too tight can impede the flow of moisture in the hay, making the hay dry out prem", "answer": " 600"}

Choices: 1: A: Three 2: B: Five 3: C: Seven 4: D: Nine 5: E: Zero\nOutput: To answer this question, first it is helpful to find the second digit chosen by both you and your friend. As the question states that the second digit of your friend equals one less than your own, we can begin to discern the second digit that each of you chose as your first choice, and the second digit that each you chose as your second choice.\n\nGiven that the second digit chosen by you is 3 and that the number you choose added to the number chosen by your friend is 137, the second digit you initially chose must be 7.\nSimilarly, given that the second digit chosen 7 by you is one less than your friend's second digit, which must be 8, the second digit you chose is 1.\nWe can now determine the second digits you and your friend each chose as follows:\n\nThe second digit chosen by you: 7\nThe second digit chosen your friend: 1\nIn other words, your second digit is 3 (the number you add to your friend's number to arrive at 1377) and your friend's second is 7 (the second digit of the sum of your first digit and your friend's first digit). For example, if you chose 2 as your first digit, then the first digit chosen by your friend would be 2 and the second digit chosen by your friend is the digit 3, since the choice of 2 plus 3 is 5.\nTo find the digit chosen by your friend as their second digit, we see that the digit chosen by your first friend is the digit one more than the second digit you chose.\nFor instance, if", "answer": " 132"}

If the band plays all 30 songs in the first and second sets collectively, there would be 2 songs left to be played in the third and fourth. This means that the band would play 32 songs in total. The initial set is excluded as it is known that they played 5 in the first and 7 in the second.

If we want the number to be 1/40, then we would need to add 40/100 to the original number = 5/16 more, i.e., 11/20 more.\n4. Therefore, the original number must be 11/28\n5. The possible numbers are\n1. 1/28\n2. 2/28\n3. 3/28\n4. 4/28\n5 and 6. 5/28 and 6/28\n6.

{"text": "1: In the problem, we are given a fish that is cared for and is said to live 2 years longer (1.5 times as long) than a dog.\n2. Therefore, the first statement is true.\n3. But, 1 time as long will mean that the fish will live for the same length as a dog, which would \nbe 2 years or 24 months in total.\n4. Since 1 time as long is 1.5 times shorter than 1 x 1.5, this makes Fish live only 1.5 x 1.5 x Dog = 2.25 times as long as 2 years, which is 4 years or 48 months. So, Dogs can live for 48 months.\n5. The next part tells us that Dog lives on average 4 times as long.\n6. It\u2019s given that dogs live for an average of 18 months, which is 4 times greater than 4.5 months (hamsters\u2019 avg life expectancy in the problem). Therefore, the answer has to be 18 months.\n7. The hamster\u2019s avg life expectancy is 2.5 times longer than fish.\n8. Therefore, the most precise answer would be 62.5 months (2.5 x (1.5 x 4.5)) months. It is not 1.5 because it is the average of 1.5 months long for the fish and it is 6 months shorter than 6.5 x 48 (1.5 x dog x 4) which leads to a total of 48 months long.\n9. So, the answer is 62.5 because it is more precise.\nSo the final ans is D: 62.5\n\n### Important info & notes:\nIn most of the questions, a mathematical equation is given which needs to be solved.\nIf you get stuck somewhere, you can always put the input and output together to work on your answer.\nAns.

{"text": "1. Given the problem, in which Yolanda has left home for work and her husband has realized that she forgot to bring lunch, we can infer that the husband is either running late himself or coming to rescue her.\n2. Accordingly, we are trying to determine the time between them upon the husband's arrival.\n3. We start by calculating the distance they would travel at 20 mph (Yolanda) and 40 mph (the husband), respectively, using the formula d = rt, where d stands for distance traveled, r for speed, and t for the elapsed time. \n4. Thus, d20 = 20 \u00d7 100 t20 and d40 = 40 \u00d7 10 t40\n5. Substituting t20 = t for d20 = d40 using the basic mathematical identity r2 = 2dr, we get r2 = 2d(t20), or r2 = 2(20)(10)20. This, in turn, implies r = 10, which refers to the value of Yolanda's speed, as well as d20 = 100.\n6. Similarly, the husband's speed is calculated by d40 = 2d(30), with d40 = 80 (80 mph).\n7.

Thus, based on the calculation, it takes 0.1 hours for Yolanda to travel at 20 miles/hour, plus the husband's 0.30 hours, when traveling at 40 miles/hour, which makes for 1.40 hours, which equals to 1.4 miles, or 0.8 miles to catch up with Yolanda.\n9.

Here we can see by using simple algebraic steps that (S-S=S-80+23-48). \n6. We can now solve for S by combining like terms on both sides of the equation, or: (S-80=S-23+48-S)). \n7. Solving for S, we can conclude that Scarlet has not spent her entire $80 and therefore will have a remaining balance of (S=27)\n8. Therefore, the answer is C: 27.\nSo the final summary answer is C:27, and in more complete word form it should be written as S-80=S(23+48)", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "1) Lets work the problem out by working out one serving at a time: \n2. We start by finding out how many servings the recipe makes. Because there are 30 guests attending, we can say that there are ten servings, so we multiply 10 by 2 to find out how many servings we have, which is 20. Since each potato is needed to make each serving, we can say it needs two potatoes. Therefore two potatoes multiplied by 20 equals 40 potatoes. We can then multiply 40 potatoes by 0.10 to find out how much ten potatoes cost, and the answer is $4. \n3. Next, we need to find out how much salt will be needed to make each serving of the recipe. We know that there are 20 servings, and that 40 potatoes are needed for 20 servings. We can say that for 40 potatoes there will be 20 servings of potatoes. Also, 40 potatoes will require four teaspoons of salt. From the previous question, we know that each teaspoon will cost $2 and that there is a five teaspoons in each container. We multiply 5 teaspoon by $2 and find out that each teaspoons cost $10. Therefore, four teaspoons will cost $40. \n4. We can then multiply $40 by the number of servings we have, and find out that 20 servings require 8 servings of salt, costing $80 for 20 servngs, which brings the total to $120. \n5.

In September he baked 14 more cakes than in August. How many cakes was he at first making on an average day?\nOutput:\n1. First let's find out in what month the bakery baked 27 cakes, when all together he has baked 45 cakes.\n2. To find the month when he baked 1.2 times more cakes: we need to find the number when bakery made n + 0.2n cakes, when n is 27.\n3. 27 + (0.2(27)) = 28.7, we make 28. So it is the number of cakes baked in February\n4. February + 1.2(28.7) = 37 (total number of cakes baker has baked)\n5. 36 (month when he baked no more cakes) + 1.2*0.2*37 or 27 cakes.

{"text": "1 The question is about Betty's total spending when she buys certain amounts of food for a party.\n2 We are given the unit cost of different items purchased by her, which are $2, $12.50 and $5 respectively.\n3. Therefore for 85 cents more than 7.5 times the unit cost of 1 glass drink, Betty will spend 85 cents. 7.5 times unit cost of 1 drink will give us 85.\n4. This can be represented as: `3(2*1) + 10(12.5/1) + 20(5/1) = 27+125+100 == 27+225 == 252`.\n5. Since Betty buys 10 glasses, she will spend $4.50 on this.\n6. Betty buys 5 cakes, so she will spend $52.50.\n7. Betty buys 150 ice creams, so she will spend 375. In total, Betty will spend about $870 on party supplies and food.\n\nInput:The probability that it will rain on Monday is.53. On Tuesday it is.37. what is the probability that it will rain one day given that it rained the previous day?\nOutput:  The question is about the probability that it will not rain given that it rained on a previous day.\n2. Here we can use the statement 'it rained on a previous' to exclude the current day.\n3. Probability is the chance that something will happen.\n4. For 1 day with 1/2 probability of rain, the actual prob is 1.  With 1/3 probability, the actual prob is also 1.\n5. Since the probability that it will actually rain is 1, the actual outcome will be 1 which means that it is very likely that it will rain. As a result, the answer for the question is E: very likely.\nSo the final and correct answer is E: very likely\n\nInput:Isabella believes that she can solve a math problem.

{"text": "1. In order to calculate the total time required to complete the entire set(8) of laundry, we must know the amount of time allotted for each load.\n2. From the problem statement, we know that each load of laundry will take around 45 minutes in the wash cycle, and another hour in the dry cycle, for a total of 2 hours per load.\n3. We need to multiply the number of loads by the total time allotted for each batch to determine the total time required.\n4. Here's the math:\n[x] = # of loads\n\"x\" = 10.\n5. Let's substitute these values in our equation above:\nTime = (10) * (2)\nTime = 20\n6.

{"text": "1 The number of crayons that Lizzie has is directly linked to her relation with Bobbie.\n2. Since Bobbie has three times the amount of crayons as Bill, we can say that he has at least 3 times as many crays as Billie, giving us a minimum of 9 crayons.\n3. Since Lizzie only has half as many cranons as Bobbie, we can say that her number of cranons is less than or equal to half of nine, which is 4.5 crayons.\n4. Since that number of crayons doesn't include Bobbie and he has more than just 3, Bobbie's amount is greater than 4.5; at least 4.5+1, which is 6.5 crayons; so Bobbie has at least 6.5 cranons.\n5. Finally we know that Bobbie has three times more than Billie, so Bobbie must have 9 times more than Billie.\n6. Since Billie has 19 crayons, we can conclude that the number of cranons that Lizzie and Bobbie have must both be less than 9.\n7. But as we know, Lizzie, Bobbie, and Bill have 4.5, 9, and 18 crays respectively.\n8. We must conclude that the total is less than 9 when multiplying the number of cranos of two different people.\n9. The total number is then 18+4.5 and rounded down to the nearest value of the lowest integer, which is 0.5.\n10.

We don't know how many full rows were in each field but the second field has one more row than the first field. We can calculate the number of cobs by subtracting 4 from 5 in the field with the most total cobs.\n5. The first field had 36 and the second field had 44.\n6. This means that the last full row of cobs in the second field had 1 more cob than the first field.\n7. To calculate how many full rows there would have to be in the second field, we divide that difference by 4 because there's 4 cobs in each row. \n8. The difference between 44 and 41 is 3, so there would have to be 3 more full rows in the second field than the first field. \n9. The second field has 5 full rows more than the first.

They would usually paint with their friends and their parents and this would most likely have to do with decorating their homes.\n4) Option C is also a valid option as painting with oneself is one of the activities children and the young ones would do rather quickly than spend more money and energy on doing it with their parents.\n5) Option D is viable as well although you do not spend more of your cash on the things related to kids but kids might be inclined to spend more time in decorating their own homes. \n6) Option E is also viable for the question as kids most often have their own way of choosing their color of preference and they would usually choose it themselves without necessarily the need for someone to help them out. \n7) Therefore, the best answer for the question", "answer": " 163"}

{"text": "1.) This is a very straight forward question to answer.\n2.) Our calculation begins by multiplying the amount of movies sold by the profit per DVD. Our final answer will be the same as the profit per DVD multiplied by the movies sold.\n3.) So the profit per DVD is calculated by:\n4.$2000 - $6 * x = $x * 2.5 where $x = movies sold.\n5.We will then multiply that amount of profits with the amount of movies.\n6.* $ x * $2000 -$6 * x = $ x *2.5 = $2.5 * $x\n7.Putting it all together, we will solve for x to get the number of movies sold.\n8.We add zero to the end to remove the profit per DVD. \n9. $ 1000 - $0.5x = $2.5* x\n10. This equation can be simplified by multiplying both sides by $2.5.\n11. x = $2.5 ( $1000 - 0.5x)\n12. To get rid of the $2.5, we will divide both sides by $2000 then subtract 0.5x from both sides to get x:\n13. $2000 /2.5 - 0.5 x = $2.67x\n14.

It is important to understand the relationship and the difference between \"price and money\" to identify the correct answer.\n6: We should be sure about the meaning of \"large\" and \"small\" in relation to the paintings.  It is not clear whether it is referring to the size of the paintings or the price.\n7: If it is referring to the price, then it can't be an answer to the equation since Noah charges for the price more. There should be a variable between \"sold\" and \"money\".\n1. Let's take a step back and re-evaluate the question. We got the information from the prompt that the painter Noah sold 8 large paintings and 4 small paintings for last month. We know he likes to achieve twice as many sales as last month. But there are still missing clues that lead to a concrete answer.\n2. One way to address this issue may be to use deductive reasoning to arrive at the solution. For instance, if he doubled the number of large paintings sold in the previous month, it's possible that he would have doubled the price. However, we can't rely on this assumption because we are not given enough information to make a definitive conclusion.\n3. Another approach may be to create a variable x and assign it to the number of times Noah increased his sales. We can then use this variable as a multiplier to determine the sale price. For instance, if x = 2, we can multiply Noah's revenue of $90 by x to arrive at the expected revenue of $180 for this month.\n4.

The US population is (1/7)% of the Earth's population.  How many people are in the US?\nOutput: 2. The question is asking us to use the percentage provided to calculate the number of people in the US.\n3. First, let's review the formula to find the percentage. We multiply the total amount we are given with the result of 100 divided by the total.\n4. In this case, we know that 1/7 is 14.28%.\n5. The population of the US is roughly around 329 million people.\n6. To find the number of people, we multiply 7852 with 329, \n7. which is 26045519891000 which is 2.6 billion.\n8.

When he first gets to the barn, the amount of manure he needs is a quarter of a ton more than it was when he left.  When he gets back, the amount of manage from the stables is six times bigger than when he left.  How much does the cow poop per second?\nOutput:  This problem uses an equal-parts series. 1. The cow poops an additional 25 kg every 6 minutes which makes the total amount 90 kg. 2. So in 6 minutes, the cow poops 15 kg which makes the total amount of 60 kg. 3. So in each minute, the cow poops at least 10 kg. 4. Since we don't know the exact amount of the second, we should use a reasonable approximations for the farmer's daily work. 5. The most possible answer can be: 1 min =  60 secs =120 times less than 15 seconds 6. The question doesn't give any more information or data and it is about the process and not the final results. 7. The amount of manure from one day of work is at least: 1. 60 kg 2. 90 kg 3. 120 kg. 8. The right answer is the least possible amount of manure from six sessions from the question's given data which is 120 kg = 2.43 ton from the given equation. \nSo the final answer should be 2.4", "answer": " 600"}
{"text": "1: The question is about John's hourly wage based on his decision to earn a bonus.\n2. Looking at the first part, we see that the base salary is $80 per day, indicating a total base salary of $640 per week. \n3. The second part of the question indicates that John works for 8 hours a day and has the option of earning a bonus of $20 per day, in addition to the $80 salary, for an extra 2-hour workday.\n4. The question then asks how much John makes per hour if they earn the bonus.\n5. So, the option will have something to do with the calculation of the hourly wage, with the bonus being a part of it.\n6. However, the amount or value in the bonus is not included in the calculation, because it refers only to the base salary.\n7. So, we can eliminate the option A: $88 per hour.\n8. We can also eliminate option B: $48 per hour since if it were 48 then the bonus would be $32\n9. We know the correct answer can't be 24, because the bonus is $20 per day. \n10.

{"text": "1) The given information of this problem are: the first tank is twice the second tank; there are 48 gallon of water in first tank; the rule is one gallon of water for one inch of fish. 2) To solve this question, let: C = # gallons of water in first tank S = # gallons of fish in first tank T = # gallons of second tank # x=# of new fish if one fish is eating other. 3) The goal of this problem is that Gail would have more fish in the first tank than second tank. 4) From above equation, we know that T = C + (S-C)/3. 5) Now there's a relationship with variables to find the minimum solution. T - S = 3(S-C)/3 C - T = 48 - 3(S- C)/3 Solving this equation, we get T= 255/3 or T= 79.3407 6) Next, we know that T -S = 3(S - C)/3, that's why there should be more fish to satisfy the relationship. So, 2 - 2 = (S - C)/3 3/2 - 3/2 =(S - C)/6 3/4 - 3/4 = T - S T = 255/6 + S S = 255 - 6T/6 8) Plug S from above equation into previous equation. T = 256 - 6(255-6T/6) Solving for number of fish, 6xT = 256 or 4xT = 128 9) Now dividing both sides by 6, T = 128(6)/4 which equal to 2.76, therefore, Gail would have 2.76 more fish in the first fish tank instead of second.", "answer": " 3"}

The key information in the problem states that the traffic pattern for cars going down Happy Street follows a certain pattern, which is important to know when solving the question.\n3. The information provided includes:\n1. On Mondays there are 15 cars per day.\n4. On Tuesdays there are 25 cars per day. \n5. On Wednesdays, there are 27 cars per day.\n6. On Thursdays and Fridays, there are 13 cars per day. 7. On Saturdays, 11 cars per day. 8. On Sundays, 9 cars in Happy Street.\n4. The question then asks how many cars a day go down Happy Street from Monday until Sunday. \n5. With that information, we can determine the number of cars that go down it per day.\n67. For example, on Mondays, there are 30 cars per day. 30-27= 3 cars more per day on Wednesdays compared to Monday i.e., number of cars on Wednesday is 33 i.e., 3 more cars on Wednesday.\n7. This pattern repeats itself across Thursday and Sunday with an extra number of cars. \n8. For example, on Thursdays there are 16 cars per day. 16+3 more cars= 19 cars on Thursday. 9. On Sundays, there are 9 cars per day. 9 = 4 more cars on Tuesday with 3 more per day the next day = 4+3= 7 cars.\n9.

We know that the sum of half of the jellybeans is red and that three fourth of the red jellybeans are coconut flavourd. These two equations can be rearranged and solve for the answer.\n4) 2 1/4 x 750 = 2 x 9 and 9 - 2 2/4 x 7/4 = 8 1/2 x 1, thus 8 1/4 + 1/4 = 8 jellybeans can be used to determine how many jellybeans there in the jar and answer to question A.\n5) We know that 750 jelbeanz have 75% of jellybeans as red and that the coconut flavoured jelbeanz are one sixth.\n\nWe can use the 16th of the red jelbeans as the number of coconut flavoured gellybeans and find the number of other jellybeans in the jar.\n\n750 x 17/100 0r 17/15 x 750 can give us 1/2.\n\nThe number of other jellybeanz can be found 15x1 + 7/5\n\nSo we have our value (100/15*750) for the coconut flavored jellybeans: 100x7/15 is 37.5 which equals 37 1/2.

{"text": "1) The question is about points, but not scoring it.  So the question is about calculating how many points someone had for the season so we will need 2 things. \nA: How many times he scored a touchdown and \nB: How many points of these touchdowns he got each time\n\nA: In the question, james scores 4 touchdown per game but each touchdown is worth only 6 points.  So after scoring, he needs to score 2 points conversion in two out of three games to get 15 points for one game.  So he gets 15 points at the end of each game.  There are 4 games in each season thus he gets 60 points.\n\nB: So the question is how many points he gain in a season but we already calculated how many points he gets in every game but it is not the sum of all these points because he needs to convert them to 6 points each time to get 15 point from each game so the required 2 point conversion.  So we need to minus 15 points and add 2 to get the 6 final points after the conversion is done. \n\nNow what is the answer?  It starts with the first calculation of scoring 15 points.  It needs to be multiplied by the number of games that were played during the season to get the required points.\n\n60 x  15 =  900 \n\n900-900 =  150\n\n150+6 =  156  \nThus he scored 156 points during the season. We need to multiply it to the previous season average of 300 and the answer will be 456 points.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is B: 456 points which is a huge difference to a whole 40 points as previous record was only 300.\n\n### Explanation of code \n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\n\"\"\"\nCreated on Mon Jan 16 11:18:07 2023\n\n@author: sai teja\n\"\"\"\n\nimport re\ndef q1():\n    l=input()\n    temp=l.split(' ')\n    print(len(l.split('')))", "answer": " 72"}

Next we multiply the previous movie's first minute cost with movie time which is 1/100th of the movie, 20 dollars x 2400 gives us 48,000 dollars for the two-hour movie.\n3. Her new movie cost 2 times the previous movie's cost which is 6 days 2 hours, meaning if we convert the money costs into days to get it to 6.2 we then multiply both of them 24.44, multiplying the previous movie cost to 6.2 gives us 124.80 as shown below:\n466 50 16.10 1733.20 48 120.25 2443.20 120.00 12 144 2100 3.35 300 50 125.00\n5.

Next, to know the percentage of plants he plant, take the total number of plants in one tree and multiply it with the percentage (60%). So, 20 x 60% = 12. \n5. Finally, to find the number of trees he plant, multiply the total number of trees with the total number of plants he's planted. That is 2*12 = 24. \n6. Therefore, the answer is 24.\n7.

This question appears to be about a dune buggy riding terrain, which implies it is on some type of land surface with various inclines, including uphills and downhills, and flats. This indicates that speed in miles per hour is relevant to this question.\n3.  The first part of the problem states that this dune buggy can run at a speed of 12 miles per hours faster than it can when traveling on downhill and 18 miles per hours slower when traveling on uphill sloped surfaces.\n4.  Given that information, we can conclude that when it is running on uphills, it is going at 18 miles per seconds, and when it is running downhill, it is going at a speed of 30 miles per hours.\n5.  The second part of the problem states how often the dune buggy is traveling on various surfaces. Specifically, a third of the time it is traveling on flat sand, a third of the the time it is traveler on uphill sloges, and lastly a third of the time on downhills.\n6.  Therefore, when the dune buggy runs flat sand, it is traveling at 60 miles per hours, then when running on uphills it is traveling at a speed of 42 miles per hours and finally when riding downhill it is traveling at of a speed of 90 miles per hour.\n7.  So, we can combine these values to get a final speed of 55 miles per hours, for the overall average speed.\n\nSo the final answer of this problem is 55.

The question is asking for the amount of rain in an area that is described as the Pacific Northwest.\n2.) 'average' refers to a number that comes from what people do often, so the amount of rain that the Pacific Northwest gets is the number most commonly found over the course of one year.\n3.) As we mentioned earlier, the 'average' is the number commonly found after a year-long study.\n4.) In order to answer the question, this amount of rain must be divided by the same number of days in order to find the daily rainfall.\n5.) We have also been told that the Pacific Northwest receives 45 inches of rain, while the rest of the country receives 37 inches. \n6.) This means the amount of rain for the Northwest is 12 inches more than the rest of the country's.\n7.)

We can see \"They spent the same amount\". So there's another step to go through. The second step is finding the main idea in the next sentence:\n4. Andy bought a can. Bob ordered two sandwich. The first sentence mentioned that Andy spent the same amount. Based on the sentence tree, we can conclude that Bob spent the same amount, and then we arrive at the answer: Bob's fruit drink costs $0.\nSo the final answers are E: $0\n\nInput:  John, like most people, found it hard to make a living as a writer.

{"text": "The question is asking about how much money is left after paying off their debts.\n\n1.The key to figuring out this question is to realize that the question is actually asking how $100 goes over several payments, thus leading to a negative answer.\n2.After determining how much money Iain has left to give to Deborah as the final payment, subtract the total amount he has given. The result will be negative because he used the money he gave Deborah to pay off his debts\n\n3.To simplify the calculation, let's assume the total sum owed to each person is $10 per individual.\n\n4.The first thing to do is to figure out the first step, and it is $10.\n\n5.Next, take the sum paid per person, which is $10, and multiply it by the number of people who received a payment: $20 * 3 people = $60 remaining for that payment.\n6.The next step is to understand what $60 means. $60 is the amount left for the third step. Now, $100 - $60 = $40, which was distributed to 2 people and there is $20 remaining for that payment step.\n7.Repeat steps 4-6 until zero payment remains and the total money left is known.\n\n8.To end the steps, the amount remaining is $72 - $175 (3 * 25) = ($23 * 2) - $120 = -$187\n\n9.So the final answer is -187 (dollars)\n\nSo the final answer to this question is -187", "answer": " 20"}

We have 3 parts used on day 1. After subtracting that we have 40-3 = 37 pills.\n6) Next, we calculate the number of pills left after day 2. We have 3 equal parts used on day 2. That gives us 30 pills.\n7) We subtract the 30 pills used on day 2 from the 40 pills left after day one, to arrive at the number of pills for day 3. The result is: 40-30 = 10 pills.\n8) Then, we arrive at the number of remaining pills in the bottles after day 6 of the plan by calculating the total number of pilling taken during those 6 days. This will be the 3 pills on day 1, 6 pills on day 2, and 3 pills on days 3-6.

Bush is younger than Matt but by 3 years means that there is another year between them with their age difference.\n2) Therefore, by using the formula for the difference of two age, 5 and 7 can be obtained.(d = 7-5 = 0). This means that Bush is 7 years younger than Matt. (Bush can't be more than 7 years younger than Matthew because then the question won't make sense).\n3) After 5 years in the future, Bush will continue with an age of 7, since he has to reach the age of 7 so as to make it 12 years. \n4) So to find out Matt's age we can take away 7 from his original age of 3, which is 3-7 = -4.This means that Matt will be a minimum of -4 years older than Bush after 5 more years pass. \n5) Subtract -4 from 10.\n6)The resulting number is -6.\n7) Therefore,Matt will be a minimum of 6 years older than Bush after passing another 5 years.\n8)In another 5 years, he will be 10 years older than Bush, who will turn 12. \n9)Therefore, Matt will turn 18.\nThus, the minimum answer.\nSo the final answers are E: 18.\n\nInput: In my country, the police are usually given respect and not treated like what?

The question is asking about the amount of money that will be given as the prize to the winner of the lotteryprize.\n3.

The ticket for the second tier costs 2 dollars, which means 12 to 1 the first ticket is sold for 1 dollar. \n5. The question is asking how much the winning ticket will receive, which means we need to calculate how much it costs the person that buys the last ticket.\n6. The last ticket costs $10, but it would have cost the winning ticket $5 more if it had been available right then. Therefore, the price of each ticket is $15 in total. \n7. Because we already have the total earnings from selling the first ticket, we simply have to subtract $1. 50 from $15 to get the earnings from selling each tier.\n8.

So, her monthly consumption is 60\u22c59 = 540 cookies\n11. Now let's find the number of boxes required to meet Basil's monthly consumption, which will be y\u22c5x = 81\u22c560 = 4,960 cookies\n12. This is equivalent to just over 496 boxes.  Since each box has 45 cookies in it and there are 60 cookies per box, then 2\u22c59 boxes are required for Basil to survive for 30 days.\n13. Thus, Basil needs 2\u22c59 =18 boxes to ensure that she survives for 30 days, and not (60/8), x = 31 boxes.\nSo the final answers are 2\u22c59 box\n\nInput: She made breakfast for the whole family, cooking bacon eggs, and toast, plus a huge pot of coffee, which she served from a vase in the kitchen.

{"text": "1. There\u2019s 1 row left empty because there\u2019s only 4 seats after the 2nd stop.\n2. We can get the number of empty seats using the row formula for n seats:\nn = total number of bus seats - # of people at start - # of people arriving later\n\n3. To solve this problem, note that number of empty seats after second stop can be represented in the below equation:\n\nNumber of people getting on the bus before the second stop = 17\nNumber of people getting off the bus before the second step = 10\nNumber of total bus seats at the 1st and 2nd stop = 0(bus seats after stopping) +16(people at start) + 10(people getting off) - 15(people getting on) - 27(people leaving)\n\nSo, for the seat arrangement, the number of empty seats after 2nd stop would be:\nN(empty seats) = 23 - (total number of bus seats)\n\n4. The formula for the number of seats is: 23 - (0 + 16 + 10) - 15 \u2248 4 seats\n5. Therefore, the answer for the seats of a bus are the seats after the first row.\n6.

We are now required to answer how many cakes Anna has left.\n2 Let's begin by dividing the 1/5 cup into eaten and un-eaten cupcakes.\n3 Since 3/5 were already eaten, we have:\n4 1/5 \u2014 3/5 = 1/10 = 1/8 = 1/20 = 1/50 = 1/250 We can then further break down 1/50, and since 1/8 was just multiplied by 1/20 to get 1/50 and we want whole numbers, we will multiply by 1/2 to get 1/25 1 = 0.25\n5 We're almost there! Now, if 1/25 was eaten, Anna has only 1/24. This is an approximation. To get exact: 1/25 \u2014 25/250 = 13/250 =.0052\n6 The final result is that Anna has 52 cupcakes\nSo the final answer 52 cupcaked.\n\nInput:You have 10 pizzas on your table.

{"text": "1.\"30 candies\" in the question refers to total number of candies in the bucket.\n2. The wording  \"ate them up\" could give an impression that each candies were eaten individually by 3 people, but the question doesn't ask how many people ate up the bucket; only that they eat until they cried.\n3. The order of the numbers suggests that each of these people can eat 2/3 number of candies that Jacob can eat. And the question is focused on 30 candies.\n4. Therefore, there are three possibilities:\na. 1/3 of 30 is Lana'd number.\nb. 2/3 of 3 is Jacob's number.\nc. 1/3 * 2/3 equals Nellie's number.\n5. The answer is: (a+b)/(c+1) or b/c.\nSo the final number is 15 for Lana, 10 for Jacob, and 6 for Nellie.\n\nInput: The new product is only available in stores like Home Depot and Lowe's.  You'll what?

The question provides specific information about the number of elephants on Friday evening and the number of elephant who left the park the next morning, as well as the time it took to complete the movement out of the park.\n3. Based on the information provided, we can determine that the rate of new elephanters entering the park should be equal to the number of elephantes leaving the park, minus the initial count of elephants.\n4. The number of elephants leaving the park = 30,030 (Friday evening count) - 28,960(number of elephants there at the end of the out-flow period) = 1,070\n5. number of new elephants going into the park = new elephants - old (initial) elephants = 30,980-1,070=29,910 6. New elephants entering the  park = 29,91*5 = 149,550 7. There was a 7-hour period between when the last elephant left the park and when elephant arrived. New elephants were arriving at a rate of 149, 550 elephants per hour (equation: new elephants - 150,000/7 = 211,428.57 elephants arrived)\n8. Therefore, the answer is E, 211, 428.5 elephants per hour.\nSo the final answe is 211,988.5\n\nInput: I need a pizza! This guy is the closest.

Since Mom had \u20ac55 Euros, she would definitely be unable to buy a chicken at \u20ac11, since she was now left with less than \u20ac50 Euros.\n3. We can clearly identify the pattern to figure out the remaining amount. Let\u2019s first find out how many Euros Mom would be left with once she bought one of each item.\n4. 1 pack of bananas = 2 bananas (each banana costs 4\u20ac hence its 8\u20ac in total) and 8\u20ac left.\n5. 1 pack of asparagus = 6 asparagus and 20\u20ac left\n6. 1 pear = 2\u20ac and 10\u20ac left\n7. 1 chicken = 11\u20ac and 24\u20ac left.\n8.

A lot of people are choosing to buy bottled water, but is it really any safer? Let's consider both water purity and safety. In most cases, the bottled water's production is unmonitored, making contaminants possible. The process of bottling the water leaves it open to pathogens that might be in the air or the water source and in some cases the bottles themselves have been implicated in illnesses. But on the other hand, we do know that public water systems in some parts of the world can also become contaminated due to bacteria, fungus, parasites, viruses, or other elements. While it is true that public water systems are monitored for contaminants, they are not always as safe as we hope. It is important to understand that as the water is distributed, it can and will become more contaminated by being exposed to air and pollution.

Baking pizza dough and making pizza takes about 20 minutes every 30 minutes.\n7. Therefore, if one batch makes only two pizzas, then how many times that batch can make one pizza?\n8. Let's assume that there are enough ingredients to make three pizzas per batch.\n9. Thus, multiply the batch and the batch rate, which is 2. That means that each batch will make 2 * 20 = 40 minutes of dough and pizza.\n10. However, the oven can only make two pizzas at once, so it will take three batches in total.\n11.

Then, \"Rose bought a pack of cards\" means that Rose only bought one pack of basketball cards.\n10.) Therefore, since Mary and Rose each spent the same amount, then we can deduce that Rose only bought 1 pack of basketball cards, which means that the cost of each pack of basketball cards is $150.\n11.) Finally, the question is solved like so:\n    100x2 + 150 = 100+150\n    2(100+100) = 300+300\n    400 = 600\n    4x2 = 6x2\n    16=36\n    8=36\n    The cost of one package of basketball card $36\nSo the final answer", "answer": " 25"}

We determine the number of yards for each gift from the information provided, namely each gift needs two yards. We can write this in a equation form as y=2 where y represents the quantity of yards of ribbon allocated to the gift. The total number of yards of ribbon available=18. Thus, the requirement of each gift = 2 yards.\n4. Once we know the number of yards for the six gifts, we can use the formula y=18/6 to find out how many yards of the 18-feet remaining are left.\n5. We can get 4 yards remaining.

To answer the question, we need to determine the number of parrotes, number of snakes and number of monkeys.\n6. We can use the following equations to calculate the number of animals of the zoo : 8 Parrots = 3 Snake * 2 Monkeys = [(3 + 0.5) Snake + ((3) - 3) zebra]\n7. Therefore, we can calculate the number of monkeys: 2 Snake * 0.5 Parrots + (3 - 3) z \n8. zebra = 2 Snake * Monkeys 9. Therefore, the number of zebras is 2 snakes times the number of monkey.\n10. Given our working, the total number of parrots is 315 and the total of zebra is 4.\n11.

The first thing to note is that the question mentions \"how long\" would it take, which implies that it is not about one particular number of minutes, but rather the total time it would take to fill all of the packets.\n2. The gummies are manufactured at 300 a minute, which means 300 gummies are produced every minute, or 5 per second, which can be expressed as 5s/minute or 0.083 35a/min or 0.833 ms per minute.\n3.

{"text": "1.)The first step in solving this word problem is to identify the operations that need to be performed. In this case, we are asked to find the sum of the money collected after 7 days by Margaux from her friend, brother, and cousin.\n2.)The next step is to identify any constraints or assumptions in the data. In this case, there are no constraints or assumptions; we are told exactly how much each person pays Margaux every day.\n3.)We can then use the multiplication principle to solve the problem. To do this, we multiply each person's daily payment by the number of days they are paid. For Margaux's friend, $5 per day is multiplied by 7 days, for a total of $35. For her brother, $8 per day is multiplied 7 days, for $56. For her cousin, $4 per day is multiplied seven days, for a total $28. The sum of the money collected from each person is $119.\n4.)It is important to note that if we did not multiply each person's payment by the number of payment days, the final sum of money collected would be incorrect. \n5.)To test this answer, let's say our friend's payment is $7.50 and not $5. If this was the case, we would multiply $7.50 by 7 days, which equals $52.50 not $35. We would get the wrong answer if we didn't multiply the person's payment by 7 days.\n6.)Therefore, it is crucial to use the multiplication principle to ensure that we are using the correct method and arriving at the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are $119.00.\n\nInput:I need to travel to Tampa.

Crocodiles' gait differs from that of land animals and can achieve a speed of twenty-five kilometers per hour.\n2. 4 hours is the number of hours necessary for a lone crocodile to travel from the Nile to the Nelta.\n3. Since the return journey to the river Nile required 2 more hours than the trip to the Nile Delt, it can be concluded that the group of crocodiles would reach their destination in 6 additional hours, bringing the total time spent walking back to 10 hours.\n4. This indicates that crocodiles prefer to walk slowly, despite having the advantage of being able to move more quickly after a period of swimming.\nTherefore, the time taken by all the travelers, both solo and in a group, to return is 10 hours. The sum of 6 and 4 is 10, which means that the combined time is 10 hours..\n\nInput:The most expensive diamond ever sold is the Pink Star, which cost 48,718,535.19\u20ac, purchased by Hong Kong businessman Joseph Lau.

And it is: two dozen of donuts.\n2) The problem consists of determining the number of dozen of donuts Javier would buy and would sell to reach his goal of raising money for a new game which is $96.\n3) We have given the formula for determining how much Javier has to buy and sell of donuts to reach a goal, as he has to buy a dozen of donuts for $2,40, and sell it to his customers for a dollar. To determine the number of donut that Javier has to buy to reach his goal, we will have to subtract the value of the bought donuts from the value of his goal. We will have to subtract the cost of his purchase from the amount he wants to earn. Therefore, the cost of 96 donuts that Javier will buy will be $96-240. ($96-$2.40 for each dozen of donuts).\n4) To determine the number of dozen of each that Javier would buy to achieve his goal, we will also have to divide the cost by the price. Therefore, we will have to divide $48 by $2.40. The result would be 20.  Because $96 divided by $2.4 equals 20.\n5) Therefore, Javier would have to buy 20 dozen donuts for reaching his goal of $96.\n6) Javier would also have to sell the same amount.

If 5 new children are added to the guest list, their number will be 5. If 10 new children are added to it, their number will be a multiple of 10, since 5 children were left out and 10 were added.

That's only in seconds. No change would have to be our answer.\n3) That would mean that George started slower than the runner, not that he started too fast and lagged.

So, Gerald needs to perform 2 months' worth of chores to receive at least $100 a season.\n3. There are 12 months in a year (\"month\" is the root of this question), divided by 4= 3 total chores to get $100.\n4. We can also see that Gerald must perform more than one chore per month.\n5. However, if Gerald wants to perform one chore each month, he will only be able to save up to $40 a month! This makes it clear that Gerald needs to do more chores each month to earn the required amount of money to cover his season.\n6.

The second step can be represented as (2*4) gumball or 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 gumball.

This indicates that the side effects are a possible and potential occurrence, not a definite or guaranteed outcome. It is not known for certain if the new drug will cause fatal side effects, but it could.\n6. If the'may' is taken out from the sentence, it gives us the sentence : The new drug may have a fatal side effect, but it can have amazing benefits.This suggests that the new drug has good and bad aspects but the side effects have not been proven yet.\n7. After that, we have to find the best word to match the following context : \" The new drug may have fatal but if it is administer in what\"\n8.

To do this, we will first divide the difference in the amounts of money (205) by 100.\n2) Then, we can figure out the total amount of money in each account. To do this, multiply the total amount of money (200 + 400) by the interest rate, or the simple interest rate rate. \n3) We then subtract the total from the interest that is earned. The subtraction results in the interest that is earned, so we can then multiply that by the number of days in a year. \n4) For Daniella, her total amount of money at the end of the year is $400 + ($400 *.10). So, $400+$40 = $440 at the end of one year.\n5) For Ariella, her total amount of interest earned is $440+$44 = $484 at the end of one yeay.\n6) If Ariella then has $484 additional dollars in her son's account, she will have $484 + $40 = $524 after two years.\nSo, the final answer is A: $524.", "answer": " 720"}

Another option is to just find 20% for 12 days, which will give you the correct answer.\n4. As for answer C, it doesn't make sense mathematically if you use two numbers. In terms of calculation, it would be 0.75, which will give you 0.75 (not 0.67, as they wrote).\n5. The reason is that we are using whole numbers (without decimal). And we are looking for '20% of 12'.

To find \"Dallas\"' age now, we have to find his age last year by subtracting 3 from the age he was last year, then we add it to the age he's right now.\n3. The information given is\nDarcy - (age of \"Dallas\" last year - 3) - 2 = Dexter's age now.\n4. Substituting for the variables, we have\nDarcy - ((age of \"Dallas\") - 3) - (Darcy - (3 + 3 + 2) + 8) = Dexter' s age now.\n5. Expanding the brackets, we get\n(age of \"Dallas\"/3 - 1) - Darcy + 8 = Dexter'ss age now\n6. Let \"Dallas\" and Darcy be their present ages.\n7. Substituting \"Dallas\" = 10 + 10 = 20, then \"Dallas\"' present age becomes the 20 years old. And Darcy is 10 + 2 = 12 years old.\n8. Dexter's present age becomes 12+8-17 = 3.\n9.

{"text": "One approach here is to make an estimate of how many nickels he will get and round it off to the nearest dime, which would give answers between about 4 and 7, and then determine whether that estimate is within the total amount of change given or exceeds it and thus would give us an answer of less then 4. Looking at the total amount of change,  it is clear that the answer lies somewhere between 4 and 7.\nSo the final rounding up the amount of quarters and dimes for 4.20 and for 2.05 respectively and adding them together will give us the sum of 6.25 + 4.10 = 10.35, which is indeed between the amounts of 4 and 7 we were originally given.

And the we need the rounding of the dimes to the lower and  quarters to the higher and then check that whether the rounded sum is between 4 to 9 or not.\nHence we will get the answer as 4 dimes and 1 quarter is between 4 and to 9 where 40/4 is between 4 and less than 5. and 20/4 is 20  of 4.

In total, there were 3 dozen eggs available for 10 people (3 eggs per person).\n3. Of those 10 people, there were:\n3 adults - 3 eggs each\n7 children - 1 extra egg each, for a total of 3 eggs each.\n4. Finally, one egg was left over, which went to either the last person on the trip or the only unaccounted-for person.\n5. Using the information provided, we can calculate the number of boys on the trip:\n6. The number of boys = 7 - 7 = 0\n7. Therefore the number of boys is zero.\n8. If we are looking for the number of boys who received an egg, then the answer is only 6 because 1 of the 7 children who received an egg is a girl.\n9. In summary, there were 3 eggs to every adult and 1 extra egg to each child, for a total of:\n7 adults + 7 children = 38 or 27 boys and 11 girls.\n10.

{"text": "1.) The question is about calculating the total amount that Janet will owe for employee wages and taxes in one month.\n2.) There are two parts to the problem: calculating the cost of wages for each employee and then adding the wages together with FICA taxes for each employee to arrive at the final cost.\n3.) To solve this problem, let's first separate the wages for each employee into two parts: base wage and FICA taxes based on the following information.\n4.) Here, it is important to note that there are two types of workers - managers and warehouse workers. We have mentioned before that 10% of the workers' salaries are paid as FICA taxes, which means that managers will get 10% of their salaries while they are still a part of Janet's warehouse.\n8.) So, for the base wages of the managerial employees, let's use the following formula: $20/hour / [(10h + 5m)/25d] = $19.76/hour\n9.) The base pay for the warehouse workers is $15/hour.\n10.) The total base pay for each employee will be calculated as follows:\n12.) Now, let's move on to finding out how much FICA tax will be contributed by both types of workers.

{"text": "1) The question revolves around calculating the pages required to attain the goal.\n2) It's important to note that Berry's reading habits are not constant and varied from day to day, but we can still use them to predict the number of pages he needs to read on Saturday.\n3) Let's first understand the question mathematically. We have to subtract the number of pages read on each day from the goal, and add it up for the remaining days. So we know Saturday is the last day when he needs to read more than he has already read. So if we want to reach the goal of 50 pages he has to read on Saturday 17 pages more.\n4) To calculate the value of the missing variables that would make this question true we start with the following equation:\n43 pages on Sunday \u2013 50 pages = -7 pages\nWhich becomes:\n10 pages * Sunday+15 pages * Monday+ 0 -7 pages = 0 - 7 pages\nIf we multiply it all by a coefficient or coefficient of the day we get: +15*3 \u2013 0 = +45. It gives us the sum of the pages read for all the days that were not the target day. 7 pages are given on Saturday and we need to add 45 to compensate for the days before and the goal day. Hence we get 52 pages.\nSo finally our answer is: 52 pages.

The question is based on a square having an area of 30 square feet. \n2. To find the answer, the edge needs to be multiplied by 4 to find the length since one square foot is 1 foot by 1 foot. Hence, 30 square feet is 15 feet by 15 feet. \n3. Now, area = length * length, so since area = 36 square feet and we know edge multiplied by 4 = length, the question translates to 36 / (4 x Edge). \n4. However, when we multiply both sides of the equation by 4, we get the answer of 9, since (4 x Edge) = Length, or: 4 x Edge = Length x 4, which simplifies to Edges by 4. \n5.

From the premise given, a truck with 12 gallons runs out of it at the first trip to the supermarket and farm. So it makes sense that the truck drives to a supermarket and then drive back home, which is a two-mile trip. Then it makes another two-mile trip to the farm.\n4. Thus, the total distance traveled by the truck is 4 miles from 12 gallons which means the total distance travelet by the truck is equal to 12/4 or 8.

We see that she sells cupcakes for $1.50, cookies for $2 per packet, biscuits for $1 per packet.\n4. We also know that she can bake twenty cupcakes, 10 packets of cookies, and 20 packets of biscuits every day, which equals 60 cupcakes, 50 cookies, and 60 biscuits.\n5. The question is asking, \"How much money will be Uki's total earnings for five-day\".\n6. To calculate this, we can multiply the total number of each good she bakes every day, which is sixty cupcakes,  fity cookies and sixty biscuits, by the daily price of that particular good, which is 1.5 dollars for the cupcakes,  two dollars for each package of cookies and one dollar for each package of biscuits.\n7. Hence, the total amount of money Uki will earns per day is sixty cupscakes multiplied by 1.5 dollars, 50 cookies times 2 dollars each, and 60 boxes of biscuits times one dollar each, resulting in a total of $1080 per day.\n8. Now that we know that Uki makes $1080 every day, we can multiply that amount by five, which is the number of days in a week for a total of $5400.\n9. Finally, since she works five days a week, she earns $5400 for every five days.\n10.

{"text": "First off, we need to find the total number of hours an employee would work in an entire year if they work 8 hours a day every day.\n\nThere are 24 hours in a day, and 12 hours in an eight-hour workday. Therefore, an employee works 360 hours in a year.\n\nThen, we need to figure out how many workdays there are in a year based on the following assumptions:\n1. Each weekly paycheck consists of 80 hours,\n2. Employees work five 8-hour days in a week (40 hours a week x 5 days = 200 hours).\n3. There are 26 workdays in a month (26 = 365 \u00f7 12).\nWe have 52 weeks in a year, and an extra day for leap-year. So, total days in a year = 366\n\nThus, we have \n\nTotal hours worked in a paycheck for 12 months = 200 x 12 = 2400.\n\nNow, since each employee gets 12 days (8 hours each) = 96 hours of vacation time per year.\n\nMark can use half of that, but that also means he can use half (48 hours) of his 52-day weekly vacation time.\n\nHence total number of hours available over the years = 2408 - 2400 = 88 hours.\n\nTo cover each day over the year, we have\n\n\\(8-hour\\ days \\times  88\\ hours\\ a\\ year \\times \\frac{100\\%}{8-hour\\ days\\ a\\ year} = 12500\\)\n\nsince \\(100\\% =(100)\\%\\times\\frac{8-hour\\ days}{8-hour\\ day\\ a\\ year}\\) = 125 hours in every day.\n\nSo, the answer is D: 1250 hours or 53 straight days.\nSo the final Answer is D: 1080 hours or 50 straight days", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "In order to answer this question, we need to first understand the question's data. \n1. We know that it is a paycheck amount of $696, this was what Gary received after taxes were taken out. \n1. The question further specifies that Gary will then receive an extra amount for any extra hours he worked, making his overall pay $14.50 per hour, meaning Gary is working overtime shifts which compensate him for the extra hours. \n2. We know Gary received $696 as a paycheck, so that indicates how much he earned in a week. \n3. Now because a 40-hour work week is standard, what we need to know is How many hours does this represent? \n4. At 1.5 times per hour overtime, so 48 additional hours at 1.5 times pay.

{"text": "Solution:\n4. The 30 club members can be broken down into five groups based on the order of their preferred juice:\n1. Two-fifth of the club members ordered lemon juice (40% * 30 = 12 members)\n2. One-third of remaining club members (66.7% * 25 = 9 members) ordered mango juice.\n3.The remaining club members ordered orange juice (25% - 9 = 16 members)\n\n5. The solution involves finding the sum of these three values:\n\n1. Two- fifth of club members = 12\n\n\\2. One-third remaining members = 9\n\n\\ 3. The remaining club members = 16\n\n\\6.

Why is this true?\nOutput:\n1. The answer is that since they have more books than they need, she is not a smart girl.\n2. However, I have the feeling that the answer is not a number, but another quantity or amount.\n3. The word \"books\" is written in English.\n4. The only possible answers here are \"a\" and \"more\" because if it is a number, it wouldn't be a number of books.\n5. The \"her\" in the sentence refers to her sister.\n6. I think the answer should be \"a lot\" since it is impossible to have too much books.\n7. To me, \"all kinds of books\" is an adjective of her and not her sister.\n8. \"Her father\" is a pronoun which refers to her sister not herself.\n9. The father did not make a statement or an order for her to read all the books. Because he talked about a new book, he did not said to read the book.\n10.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "1.The question is asking for the number of calories burned by Ian after 5 days of exercise.\n2. We can use the information provided.  We see that Ian is jogging 5 laps around his apartment complex 100 feet each lap.  Each lap represents a complete lap around the complex.  Therefore, each lap is equal to the equivalent of 100 x 5 laps, which would be called 500 laps or, in this case, 1 mile.\n3. After 5 days of this exercise, Ian has completed 500 labs or 1 mile each day.\n4. Since each lap around represents 100 feet, we can calculate that for each lap Ian has run 30 calories each.  Therefore, every five laps he has completed 150 calories which is the equivalent of 150 cals.\n5. Thus, the answer is 150.\nSo the final math answer is 159\n\nInput: If you are trying a new recipe, you may need to convert the amount of what ingredient into what?

Choices: A: person who is suborn B: person who is subverting C: person who is subpoenas D: person who is subduing E: person who is substituting for\nOutput: 1.The question is asking the meaning of one word, \"subordinate.\"\n2. Therefore, we need to understand what the word means to select an appropriate answer.\n3. Let's analyze the possible answer choices to determine which one is correct:\n4. The word \"suborn\" means to obtain something dishonestly through bribery or corruption, therefore, it cannot be the answer.\n\n5. \"Subverting\" is defined as to secretly undermine a system or cause: which means it is similar to \"subordinate.\"\n6. The word \"subpoenas\" is the most common definition of the word: an order by a legal authority requesting a person to appear in court or to provide a document in a legal case. It is not the right answer.\n7. \"Subduing\" refers to dominate, conquer, or control someone or something with physical strength: which does not match the meaning of the word \"subordinate.\"\n8. \"Substituting\" means to substitute or replace one thing for another, which is not the meaning of the word here.\n9: So, the final answer is C: person who is \"subordination.\"\n\nInput: The manager asked for a budgetary analysis of the company's business plan", "answer": " 32"}

Next, the question states that Ed found 7 limpot shells, 2 of those oyster shells and 4 conchshells. Jacob found 4 shells, including 3 of the same type as Ed found.\n4. The problem is figuring out how many shells the pair currently have combined. We can use the additional information in the question to help us solve the problem. Ed found twice as many limpot shells, so we can say that Ed found 5 limpots. Since Jacob found 4 conch shell and 3 of those were of the same type as what Ed found, we know that Jacob found 7 conch shells.\n5. Since Ed found more limpots than Jacob found of the same shell, we can say 5 conches + 4 conches = 9 conch shells. As a result, we now know that there are 9 conch shell.\n6. Adding the oyster shells to the equation, we have 2 from Ed and 2 more from Jacob, which sums to 4 oyster shells. This means there are 9 + 4 = 13 shells in all.\n7.

It\u2019s essentially saying that Tony runs errands that involve buying groceries, getting a haircut and going to a doctors appointment.\n3. \u201cGrocery\u201d is a broad term that can refer to various items in a supermarket and therefore requires more precision to determine what the answer is. This means it is vital to understand the specifics of the scenario.\n4. In this case, the groceries are being bought in bulk, meaning that they are more than sufficient to fill up the trunk of the car.\n5. Similarly, the haircut is a single visit to a barbershop or hair salon, while the appointment at the doctor\u2019s office is likely only for one issue and does not require a long stay.\n6. The important point here is that these items take up less space and weigh less than bulk groceries and a haircut.\n7.

{"text": "1 The question is asking for a mathematical operation on 50 + (2 x 50) + (1/2 x 50).  Thus, let us first find out the common multiple of all the numbers. i.e. 400 2. Let us multiply by 400, 400 *50 = 20000 and multiply by 42 * 400 = 16800 (note here the two numbers have the difference of 80. Therefore, by using common multiple of 400 - by dividing one number by another - we can multiply any number by a variable number of times. (As a note here multiplying by an even number is not as useful as even number is divisible by 2 and so we need to divide it by 2. But in case of multiplying with even number, we can multiply an arbitrary number of times and divide the remaining 80. Which also satisfies the requirements of common multiple)\n3. Now we multiply our number, 16804 (since multiplying by 400 is the same as multiplying by 42 and subtracting 80 from the remainder, 42 here) and this gives us a total of 62400, that will be the number of books they own.\nSo the final mathematical operation to be performed on 16806 would be to multiply it by 4, which would give us a total of 16802402 (in scientific notation).\nSo, the final answer is 1680,2402\n\nInput:The company I work for is known as the \"Tortoise\" because it's what?

We can assume that the remaining number of candies is one of the multiple choices (i.e. the number for A,B,C or D).\n3.

The correct answer to this question is C: Because her husband is hurt by their behavior.  The reason why is because in the sentence the narrator is telling us'She was angry so she turnes her back and refuse to speek with them' the'her husband was really hurt' and we come to conclusion that'her husband was really hap' means that she turned her back and start speaking to others cause she doesn't care what other people will say to her  But it's not the answer to the sentence.\nSo the final option is 'Her husband was really hurt'and the answer is C: Because her husban is really hurt\n\n### Part 2\nInput: They had a pretty good idea what was up.

{"text": "The question asks how long it would have taken Matthew to make the caramel-apple cakes if the oven had heated to the right temperature. \n1. The first sentence states that Matthew arrives early to begin his work, which implies that he works for at least a full hour in the morning before starting the process of making the caramel-\n\napple coffee cakes. \n2. The next sentence specifically states that he takes one full hour to assemble the ingredients, which includes combining the dried apples, brown sugar, flour, butter, and eggs.  This process could reasonably take up to one hour if it were done properly and without any errors. \n3. After gathering the ingredients, the next sentence states that Matthew bakes the cakes for a total of 1.5 hours, which is half a period before lunch.  Again, this can be a fairly long process that involves combining other ingredients and baking time, all of which adds up to 1.5 hours. \n4. After baking the cakes, Matthew decorates them with cinnamon for another hour before being finished with his work. \n5. Due to the failure of the oven and extended baking time, the cakes took twice as long to bake.  Therefore, Matthew spent 2 hours baking and decorating the cakes instead of the usual 1.5 hours it usually took. \n6. However, this does not mean that Matthew did not work the same amount of time as usual.  He still spent one full hour assembling the ingredients and two additional hours for baking and decorating, which is 3.5 hours or a full period before lunch.\n7. To address the question, we must deduct the time given for making the caramel apple coffee cakes from the total length of time spent making and decorating them.  After making the necessary calculations, we find that Matthew spent a total of 3.5 hours to make the caramels apple coffee cakes.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is C (3.5/60).\nSo the final answer i C (3.5 / 60) = 0.0625\n\nInput: The problem was well-defined when the instructions clearly state that two sides of a triangle have lengths of '7' and '", "answer": " 5"}

The first two choices (\"A\" and \"B\") are incorrect because they do not answer the question directly. \"A\" implies that if you are in one place, you cannot return to another place. However, this does not address the original statement, which states that you cannot \"get there from here\" without a context or specific location being given.\n3. The remaining choices (\"C\" and \"E\") are the only possible answers because they relate to the specific location and are in the negative. \"C\" suggests that the original statement states that it is not possible to access another location from the current one.

So, the correct answer is \"C\" because it is the only choice that directly addresses and negates the original statement.\nInput:In 2018, the United States issued 403,372 conditional temporary permits.

{"text": "The problem states that the two men each bought, 30 apple, 20 lesser than the number of applea bought by each of the woman.\nSolution Step: Since the problem's statement mentions the number of men, the number of women and the number of apples, it is  clear that there are three women. So, the number of men + the number of women (as we consider no one left to buy apples) = 2\nSo the total number of apples the three women bought = 30 - 20 (each)\n= 10 (1/2, since women bought apples in pair)\nSo, we can simply use the below formula, to find solution to the given problem:\n- Total number of Apples (let say \"A\") = Sum (A+B) - Sum (B+C) \n- For the given problem, \"A\" = (10 + 2) - (20 + 5)\n    = 11 - 25\n    = - 14\nSo, the total quantity of apples bought by the 3 women = -14\nSo the total number apples bought by three mens = 14(x + 1) = 19\n\nSo the total number sold apples = 14 + 19 = 33\n\n### Input : A) the question states the total number of applause that was offered to the singer at the concert and then states that this number was 30\nB) the question then goes on to explain that after the song, there was only 4 more claps than before \nSolution: Given two the problem statement first we have the number of applauses offered to the singer which is 30\n\n# Let's consider each row and column one by one to arrive at solution of the problem:\n\n### Let's calculate the number of clap offered after the song, \n\n```julia\nclap_after_song = 30 - b\nclap_after = 26\n```\n\n### As the first number can't be negative or 0, so the answer to the statement that was offered 30 claps before the song was offered\n```julia \na = 30 \nb = 26\n# So", "answer": " 210"}

We are trying to find out Theodore's total monthly earnings, and we need to use the information given to answer the question.\n5. To begin, we simplify our problem by breaking down the information into a mathematical expression. Given the information, we can write: \n```math\nM = T + 20W \u2013 2S\n```\nwhere M is Theodore's total income, T is the cost of taxes, W is the value of the wooden statues and S is the value of the stone statues.\n\n6. We can further simplify the equation by eliminating variables to get:\n```math\n10 M = 2 M + 20 W + S\n```\n7. We now rearrange the equation so that we can solve for M and then use subtraction to find W and S. The final equation looks like this: \n```math M = 30 W \u2013 10 S```\n\n8. We are looking for the total earnings of Theodore ($10S + 3W), but since it is asked in the question, we will put M and then subtract W and S to get our final result.\n```math\n1 M = W\n```\nWhich means that Theodore's total earned per month is = 100W\nSo the final answer for this question is M = 100 W.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question. \n\nGiven:\n\n```math\nF(x) = -x^2 + 3x + 9\n\nf'(x) = -2x + 3\n\nf''(x) = -2\n\n```\n\nWe have to use the properties of derivative to find the derivative of\n3 times negative 3 times square root of x\n\nTo get the answer, we will first convert the fraction into the normal form, which we can do because both numer", "answer": " 270"}

The statement \u201cMarcy decides to bring\u201c suggests there is some choice, that she chose to bring certain amount of tube, hence, she is responsible for it and that she had some reason to bring that amount.\n\nNext sentence suggests that each tube of lip glos hold enough to paint 3 person's makeup. This part would be important when she would choose tube she would bring. If she knew that each tube of glos hold enough to makeup 3 person, why she is bringing 6 tubes?\n\nThe answer to this question is that she is bringing enough for 6 times more then the people in the group which is 3 each tube, is enough. And that is why she counts 6 tubes. \n\nTherefore, the answer to this problem could be 6 or 12, because she brought each tube contains 2 tubes and she brought enough for each and every one of those tubes to makeup 3 people makeup, therefore, each tube will contain one third of people (that is, 3 out of 10 for the people count of the group, which suggests there is 10 people in the group and not just any 3).\n\n\nInput: You are at the grocery store and have enough money to buy 10 items or less (not including tax).

{"text": "1. The question refers to a rectangle with a length x and width y, as well as a fence with a total length of 640 feet.\n2. The question states that the long sides of the rectangle are three times the length, which means that the width of the long sides is also three times the length.\n3. We can express this as 3x = 4y, or 3/4 x = y, where x represents the length of the long side of the rectangle and y represents the width of the long side.\n4. The length of the rectangle is 640 feet, so the length of the long sides can be calculated as 640/3 = 213 feet.\n5. Similarly, the width of the longside can be calculated as 213 x 3/4 = 213 x (3/4) => 312.1 feet.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the length of the rectangle is three times the width, which means that the length of a long side is 3 times the width of the short sides (= 213 feet), while the length of the short side itself is 73.7 feet.\n7. From here, we can calculate the number of feet of fence that need to be replaced by using the formula for the area of a rectangle: A = y x w.\n8. Substituting the values of y = 73.7 ft and w = 213 ft, we get: A = 213 X 73.7 = 1788 feet\n9.

The information provided shows that John earned $18 on saturday and half that amount on Sunday, or $9. Then, he earned $20 the weekend before that for a total of $47.\n3. Let's use this information and start by subtracting the last amount from the goal. $60 - $20 = $40, which we round down to get $30. That brings us to a total of $30.\n4. We need to add this $30 amount to what John is still owed to reach his goal. So we add this $30 to what John already earned for a total of $77.\n5. Now, let's use that to go back to the original question. John needs another $23 to complete the $60.\n6.

Their age is the number of their birthday. How old is a person who is 17 on their birthday for the first time in their life? How long has it been since their birthday? \nOutput: 1) The question asks for a person's age when they are young and have had one birthday.\n2) Since the question states the person is 17 on its birthday for the first, so they have to be 18 years old.\n3) Since the question states it is the first birthday, so it has been 1 year since the birthday.\n4) Let us know what is the equation to sum the birthday and age. \n5) Here the birthday is \"n\" and age is \"y\".

{"text": "The question is about Ursula's change in her 30-second commercial. It requires that Ursula is given to shorten the video by 30% and it then asks how long the new video will be after Ursula makes those changes.\n1. The question is pretty straightforward. It says \"30-second long video\" in the beginning.\n2. The change that Ursula is given means that she is told to shorten the commercial to 0.7 seconds or it can be a percent too as it is a mathematical question.\n3. Using algebra we can write the equation of 0.7 % = 0.3 * 50, this means that after Ursula makes the change, 0.3 *50 = 0.7.\n4. Solving this equation provides us with the solution of 0.4 * 50 = 0\n5. Since 0 * 50 =50, it leads us to conclude that Ursula's new video will be 40 seconds long.\n6. Thus the final answer is D, 40 seconds.", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "1: Arven spent $800 on five puppies, and three of those puppies are now on sale for $160 each. Therefore, \"those two other puppies\" refers to the non-sale puppies, which means they cost $550.\n2: \"One of those\" refers to the non sale puppy, which means the other one costs $300\n3: \"Each\" means one dollar less for three puppies which means three sale puppies costs $146 each. In other words each sale puppy cost $ 139 less than the original price. So we can say that  those two puppies in the sale cost each $139 less, which is $71 each, so that makes $150/2. So it gives the original price of the puppy in the sale $71 less so its new cost is $71/2 is $35 each $35+$71+$71=$187.50.

{"text": "The expression in the question is set up as a problem involving two variables. One variable represents one account and the other variable represents the other account, summing to $3,455. \n1. We want to determine the combined balance of both accounts, which we can get by multiplying one variable by 4.\n2. The values of the variables are unknown for what is being asked in the question.\n3. The total combined balance is the key to finding a solution.\n4. We start by replacing each variable with a different variable to help make the equation more clear. That's also what most people and teachers do to simplify the equation before setting it up.\n5. There's no difference between the terms, since each variable stands for the same overall value.\n6. That makes this equation: -8x + $3,451. The problem becomes: Solving for X, when there isn't enough information about the value of the variables.\n7. So the expression becomes: 2x + 3,451, but the question still needs to be answered.\n8. It turns out that Gina started with having $1,488 in each account. After having one account worth $3,252, it equals exactly $3,453.\n9. We see that Gina has exactly the same amount in both accounts. We then subtract it from Betty's account. She would end up making $0.\n10. We can make Betty account have the same amount in both her accounts.\n11. Betty would find out that Gina is trying to take half of $3,452 and making it come out to exactly $1,725. We then subtract it, and that makes $227.\n12. If you add those two together, the answer should be $227. \n13. If we solve for X, it's equal to $227. So it will be: 2x = 227. If we divide both sides by 2, we get 1x = 113. So Gina has $113 in both accounts.

The question states that a group of spiders have 10 more spiers than half as many legs compared to a single spider.\n2. Therefore, we want to look for a way to solve for the number of spiders and half as many legs compared.\n3. The easiest way to do this is to re-write the question using variables.\n4. Let us assume that there are n spiders in the group.\n5. It can be noted that there are 2*n and n/2 (half) legs for the group of spiders.\n6. If we let x be the number of legs that a single spider has (and x represents all the eight legs), we can write n = 2*x and n/2 = x/2.\n7. Now that we have written the required variables and solved it, lets plug the values.\n8. x = 8 and x/2 = 4 now substitute the values 8 for x and 4 for x/2 in our equation n = 2*8 andn/2 =.\n9.

Additionally, we know that there are five people in Julia's family: her mom, her dad, her grandma, and her three little sisters.\n8. These facts will help us calculate the total cost for their tickets. We can use the information given to develop a solution.\n9. Starting with the first option, A: $40, it means that all adults will pay $40, which amounts to $40 total for the tickets. However, if we assume that Julia's dad is paying for all of the tickets, we can deduct that he would only pay $10 and therefore, $40 total for tickets for the first option is incorrect.\n10. For the second option, B: $50, the same reasoning applies: all adults paying $50 adds up to $50 total for the ticked.\nHowever, in this option, Julia's dad should not be paying the full price for everyone. That means that he will only be charged $10, and the remaining five tickets will be $5 each.

As my niece is four years, when she completed her two years old, I was two times her older age. We all know 24 + 2y = 25.\n3. As she is four years old, her two years old is two times her age.\n4. But if I am 2y older than her, then she is three times my younger age.  \nHence if (2y + 2y) = 3z\n5. Thus 2y + 2x = 3z\n6. Subtract the first equation with second equation; 2y = -z\n7.

These colored beads come through holes in which the thread that holds them together passes.  When the thread is pulled tightly to set the jewelry in place, the beads may come through the holes.  Suppose a string of a certain length contains the same number of beads as of thread and the beads are evenly spaced along the thread.  Suppose the hole is large enough to accommodate the thread going through, but the hole is small enough to prevent the bead from going through.  What percent of the beads will be able to pass through a hole of the same size, if the thread is tight?\nOutput:  The first question asks for the number of beads that will pass through a hole, given a certain amount of thread and a certain amount of beads.  The second question asks for the percent of beads that will be able to pass though a hole, given a tight string of beads.\n3. A string of length $N$ contains $N^2$ beads and the hole is large enough for the thread to go through. Then $N$ is also large enough for a bead to go through.  The second question also requires the string to be tight.  But it doesn't say the exact requirement about the string.  So, we need to figure out its tightness to proceed.\n4. Let the length of the string be $N$.  Let $L = N/2$ be the average length of the string.  The question states $L$ is tight.

{"text": "1) The question mentions 3 of each CD and asks to calculate the total amount spent if the CDs are shared among the friends. This suggests buying 3 copies of each CD.\n2) The CDs are priced as follows -\n100, 50, 85.\n3) We can infer that the friends are equal shares of the CDs if we buy three copies of each CD. This can be represented mathematically as 3x100=300 3x50=150 3x85=265.\n4) The total amount spent can be calculated by multiplying the total cost by the number of copies we bought. This gives us 300 * 70/3=210, + 150 * 4/3=200, + 265 * 2/3=173. So the total amount spent = 210 + 200 + 173 = 583.\n5) From the question, it can be inferred that we wanted to spend as little money as possible and share the CDs equally.

{"text": "1) First, we need to determine how many cups of coffee Maddie's mom is making per week. The question indicates that she is making 2 cups of tea per day. Each cup contains 1.5 ounce of coffee beans. We can convert this into cups per week by multiplying 1.5 1706, which is 24.5 cups. This means that the mom is making 24.5 ounces, or almost 2 cups, of coffee per week if she makes it everyday at her usual rate. \n2) We then need to determine how much the coffee costs per ounce, which can be calculated by dividing the total cost of a bag of coffee by the weight of a single ounce of beans. 10.5 oz 16.9 oz per $8 bag = $0.47/oz \n3) To get how much milk she uses per week, we need to add all of her weekly uses together. We can do that by adding all of her weekly milk usage by converting her milk uses into a number of cups of coffee that she is consuming. Using the information presented, she uses 1/2 gallon of milk per day. For each use, we assume half of this is coffee. In a week, this means she uses 5 gallons. We can also convert this into cups. 5 gallons 8.33 cups per gallon = 42.17 daily cups of coffee = 429.1 cups per week \n4) Now that we have all of our information and calculations for each variable, we can determine how much her coffee costs her per week. By multipying all of the variables together we get 1.5 oz x $0.47 1/2 gal x 429.2 cups x 1/2 pt = $43.88 This means that the cost of her coffee per week is $43.84\nSo the final answer of Maddie how much does she spend on coffee per week?

{"text": "18 + 18 = 36\n1. Total km walked: \n2. It could be said that both girls walked 9km. But based on the question, we know that the total distance traveled by both was twice as much. This means Nadia could have walked at least 9km - the distance Hannah walked!\n3. So we can assume, by default, that Nadia walked 9km. Or by default we can assume that Hannah walked 9km as well.\n4. So we know it's not just Nadia walking 9km. By definition it's 'twice' the number of kilometres Hannah walked. Hannah cannot have walked at least 5km. So we can eliminate the possibility of Hannah walking 9km.\n5. So it can be reasoned, by default: Nadia + Hannah + Nadia's 2x factor would mean that they walked 9km together.\n6. This means: Nadia walked 18km. Hannah walked 18km as well.\n7. So the option '18 + 13 = 31 km' is incorrect.\n8. '18 + 9 = 27 km'. This is incorrect because it doesn't meet the 'twice as far' requirement.\n9.

{"text": "1, there are 36 legs which means there are 18 dogs.\n2. If we know that Mariel is walking her pack of dogs and we know that there are 18 unaccounted for dogs, we can solve this problem by subtracting the known value of 18 from the total legs tangled.\n3. This leaves us with 36 - 18 = 18, which is the number of dogs Mariel is walking.\n4. We can solve this problem using deductive reasoning as it requires us to determine how many dogs Mariel is walking by subtracting the number of known dogs from the total number of legs tangled in all the leashes to determine the number of dogs that are not Mariel's.\n5. This process makes sense because Mariel's dogs would not be tangled up with the unaccounted dogs.\n6. If Mariel were alone with 18 dogs, there would obviously be no leashes.\n7. Additionally, since Mariel is the one tangled, it's unlikely that she and the dogs she is walking are all tangled, which means there is a difference between the number of dog legs Mariel is holding and the total legs tangled in leashes.\n8. If there were multiple Mariels and their dogs tangled up, the problem would require more steps to solve, so it can only mean that one person got tangled with another dog walker's 3 dogs.\n9. To solve this word problem, we need to understand that there are 36 total legs, 18 of which are Mariel's dogs' legs.\n10. This means that there are 1,888 legs that are not Mariel or her dogs, which leads us to conclude that there are 19 more dogs walking with the other person.\n11. Since there are 36 leashes, it's easy to deduce that there are 11 leashes attached to each of these 19 dogs. (36 / 18 = 4; 4x11 = 44)\n12. Therefore, the correct answer is E: 19.", "answer": " 5"}

The width of the road is the same as three times the width of the smallest park. There is enough space to plant trees on both the street and the lawn of the park. If each tree cost 315 US dollars, how much would the project cost in $230 US? Choice A: $116. B: $939. C: $1391. D: $912. E: $1254. I could definitely use some help with  E: $1226\nOutput: 1-Firstly, since the width of the park is equal to three times the width of a given park, we know that the difference in width of the street and the laund is 4 ft.\n2. Secondly, assuming the width of the road is equal to 120 ft, since a square has four sides equal to 12 feet, we get the following equation:\n120*(12-4) = (L)^2 + (width of the smallest park)^2.\n3. Solving for (L) given the two solutions for L + 120 - 4 and L + 12 - ((120 -12)/4), we get, L=1115.9636 ft.\n4. Using this, we can substitute the value of L into the equation to evaluate how much money is required to plant all the trees (", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "1..\n2. The question is asking how much higher the height of the computer screen should be than the side of the square piece of paper whose the perimeter is 20 centimeters shorter than the height of the computer. \n3. To solve the problem, we will calculate how high the screen should be and subtract the perimeter using Pythagoras' theorem. \n4. Square the side 20 cm (10 cm x 10 cm) and find the perimeter of the square whose perimeter is 2 less than twice the side of the square. Then, use Pythagoras'theorem to find the height of the square, which is 24 cm. 5. Finally, subtract the perimeter of the side (48cm) from the height of the square (24 cm) to get the answer (48 cm). 6. That is how many meters the height of the square should be added to the height of the screen before it will be equal to 20 centim\n7. So that's the height of the screen must be 48 cm or 480 millimeters.\nSo the final ans. is 48 cm\n\nInput: There are 3610 miles in a trip that crosses three states and begins where the last letter in California is in the state name.

This gives us X = D/1.2 = 3/4.\n2: The word 'compound' typically refers to a complex organic molecule, comprising multiple elements or atoms. This suggests that in the equation, the number of cows is half the number of frogs. This reduces the total number of animals to: A/2 = 160/2 = 80.\n3: The equation tells us that the number of frogs is twice the number of cows. This implies that the number of dogs is: D/2X = 4/8 = 0.5.\n4: To find the total number of animals, we add the number of cows, 0.5, and frogs, 0.5*2=1.\n5: This means that the total number of animals is equal to 2.\nSo the final sum equals 2\n\nInput:In the given figure, triangle PQR and triangle ABC are similar triangles so PQ = AB, QR = AC, and RP = BC.

From this statement, it can be inferred that the difference between Yolas weight in 2015 and 2017 is 30 pounds.\n3. Second of all, we see that Yola weighed 220 pounds currently, and thus we can assume that Yola's weight in 2020 is 220 pounds.\n\n4. The question could refer to weight as the number of kilograms, so both answers can also be 'lbs' but the question does not refer to Yolas weight as the number of kg, so 'lbs' is not a valid option. As 'kg' is not part of the question, it cannot be part of the answer either, and thus the question doesn't provide us with enough clues to know the validity of the kg vs lbs.\n\n5.

She only worked 23 hours in 1, and the amount of hours she worked increased by 59% each of the next three years.\n1) So, in year 1, she worked approximately 23 hours in the volunteer work.\n2) After that, in the years 2-4, she worked roughly 47 hours per week (47*4=188 and that's 188 minus 23)\n3) After that, in years 5-7, she worked roughly 71 hours per week (71*4=284).\n4) And finally, in years 8-10, she worked roughly 105 hours per week (in 2014, 105*4=420 and then after 2014 she worked roughly 123 hours per week (123*4=492).\n5) Now it is easy to understand that Jane worked 123/284 = roughly 43% more hours a week (as 123 hours (years 8-10) of a week", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "1. The problem refers to a printer that produces 42 pages, but the answer refers to the output (pages) that are neither crumple nor blurred.\n2. It's important to remember that this solution is only valid if all the given conditions remain true. Otherwise, we should find a more appropriate approach to solving the problem.\n3. We can estimate that 42 is a fairly large number of pages. It is more likely that only a small fraction of the pages will be crumpled or have blurred ink, unless the condition is true. \n4. We can write some math equations to solve the problem using logic. Let's assume that for the 42 pages, n pages have blurred inking and k pages have been crumpled.\n5. The equation that can be derived from the problem's given conditions is: 42=7n+ 3k, and then, substituting the variables: n=42/ 7 and k= 42/ 3\n6. Using the above equation, calculating the number of pages which neither have blurred inks nor been crumpled becomes k-3+7=42.\n7. Therefore, 35 is the correct answer.\nSo the final and correct answer is 25.\n\nInput: After 5 months of hard study, I was able to pass the driver's test.\nOutput: 1) The question is essentially asking whether I should consider taking another course to learn how to drive because I already passed a driver's test. \n2) The sentence implies that I failed the first driver's test initially, but I was still able to pass it after 5 months of studying.\n3) Therefore, this would be an appropriate time to take another driver's course.\n\nInput: It was a very unusual request that he had made.

{"text": "1.The question is about how many trips it'll take for Caleb to fill the pool with his buckets and how many trips it will take for Cynthia to do so as well.\n2.The fact that Caleb and Cyntia are filling up the inflatable pool with buckets of water is telling us that they're trying to fill up the pool one bucket at a time.\n3.To answer this question accurately, it's important to clearly define all the constraints, limitations, and details of the task before starting to solve the problem. In this case, we need to focus on the amount of water that each bucket can hold and how many trips they need to make from the spigot to the pool. By doing so, we can better understand how long it will take Caleb and Cinthia to fill up the pool with buckets.\n4.The total amount of water that both Caleb and Cyncithia have to fill over the whole pool is 105 gallon. It's important to remember that we're dealing with gallons, not volumes of water. This change makes a huge difference in the problem itself.\n5.However, it's impossible to know how many buckets Caleb and Cincithia fill to get 105 gallonnes of water. There are multiple things that limit their capacity:\n-Each bucket only carries 7 gallons from the spigot. It's important for the problem solver to realize that Caleb and Cinthia only have two buckets to use that can hold 14 gallons of water between them, and they also have to go back and forth for 5 trips to completely fill the pool.\n\n6.With that clarified, let's look at the numbers and see how many trips Caleb and Cinchita have to make to fill up the inflatable pool.\n7.If we start counting the buckets they're not filling and skip some empty buckets, we can start numbering the buckets from 1 to 7. Each bucket contains 7 gallons of water.\n8.In this case, it would take Caleb 7 trips to fill the entire pool, since 7 gallons equals 1 trip.\n9.But how many trips will it be for Cyntia?

{"text": "1.) We can start by looking at the data given. We know that every given of cards to Miguel adds up to 24. This means that Rick must have given 24 to Miguel.\n2.) We can also see that Rick has 130-cards, which means that he has 46 cards left that he didn't give to Miguel, or 46-cards. \n3.) Since Rick has 46 cards, that means that he has to give 12 cards to each of his 3 friends and the remaining to his sisters. Let's say the remaining is equal to s. \n4.) Therefore, we can use the data given to determine that we multiply the number of cards given to his 3 friends by 12-each. This means that these three multiplied together get us to 12s, which is equal to 12*12s. \n5.) We need to take away 12*15 from it as well, which is equal to the number of cards given 15s. This means that there's enough for Rick to have left s for his sisters. \n6.) Therefore, the answer is 46-12 s = s. \n\nInput: My dog is old, and I'm very close to him. He will soon die. If I'm very distressed when he dies, what problem will I be afflicted with next? Choices:  a: death   b: old age   c: loneliness  d: disease   e: sadness\nOutput: We know the answer is not death because my dog is also old and it is likely he will die soon anyways. He may die soon from a disease or old age, but I can be \"distressed\" if my dog dies, which is not a problem - rather it is an emotion. \n1. Therefore, we should rule out these answer choices.\n2. Since we know it is not death, we can then say that it is not likely options a: old age, c: loneliness, d: disease, or e: sadness. \n3. If my dog died next, the solution is to pick one of those as a possible next problem for you. \n4. We know that you are close to your dog, and so my dog dying will cause you great deal", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": "1)The passage is describing an arctic diet consisting of fish.\n2)Fish consumption is quantified by the number of eyes.\n3)The question involves determining the amount of fish each family member will receive with Oomyapeck receiving a special amount of fish.\n4)Oomyapeck has the ability to choose how he eats one portion of his fish,  leaving behind extra eyes that he will give some to his dog or eat, himself.\n5)The question focuses on the amount of eyes left over by Oomyapeck, indicating that the other fish will be divided equally between the rest of the family.\n6)In order to find the amount each will receive, we know that Oomyapeck will have 22 eyes left over from his portion of fish.\n7)By multiplying the amount of fish consumed by all parties by the difference between that amount and the amount of eyes he has to begin with, we can see that the other family members will also receive 22 eyes with Oomyapecks portion of fish.\n8)Therefore, the entire fish, minus 22, is divided equally by the rest of the family, which means they will end up with two-thirds the amount of fish that Oomyapecks.\n9)Hence, the answer is D: 14.\nSo the final one is D: 18\n \n#---------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n# Test 2\n#--------------------------------------------------------------\n# Test 2 for Grading Math\n\n#------------------------------------------------------\n# Test 2 Instructions\n#--------------------------------------------------\n# Input:He wanted to be a pilot but as a result he couldn't afford the plane.

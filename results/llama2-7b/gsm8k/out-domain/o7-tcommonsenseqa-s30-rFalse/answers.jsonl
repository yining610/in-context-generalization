Is 428 also a factor of 496?  Justify your answer. \n\n### Demostration: 42 is the sum of two consecutive numbers, they are 41 + 43, 428 is not odd so 7 and 8 are consecutive numbers and their sum is 42 + 421, 496 is the sum of two prime numbers and their sum is divisble by 42 and 428, so we know that 428 is the sum of two primes.\n\n### Conclusion: The given question ask if 428 is a factor of 396(428/ 428), 428/ 2 is the number of times it divides without any remainder, 28 times the quotient is 2 so it is factor of 49, but 49/2 is the quotient number of 1 so it is a factor of 24, the number 24 cannot be prime number because it has to be bigger than 2.2\n\n### Demosation:\n428 \u00f7 42 = 10 42/2 42 \u00f7 2 = 21 422 \u00f7 2 42/2 = 21\n\n### Demossation:\n49/2 = 24", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "### My first line: I started the task by calculating what the gas use was. I then found that 20 * 1600= 32,000 and then to 32,060. Next I found that 8 gallons for 8 * 3200 = 25,600. Next I multiply what I had by how many more gallons Mr Montero needed and get 10,400. Hope you understand!\n### Demonstrable:\n### If I am doing math with gas tanks, I will use this equation:  32000 gallons * 160 = 50400 and 8 gallons * 32 = 2560. Next I can multiply these two and get 351600 gallons. My total gas comes out to be 771600 gall. Next I divide my gas by 600 and I get 12856. This is how much I need I need to add to Mr. Monterros tank.\n### Explanation:\n### In order to answer this question, I first calculated that 20 gallons per 400 meters. I then multiplied that by 2 to calculate the gas. First I found that 20 gallon per 600 x 400 = 32000. Next I calculated that 2 gallons per 3200 and I got 2560 gallons. After I calculated what my tank was filled with,I then multiplied the tank by how many miles Mr Monterro needed and 1600. It gave me 10400 gallons needed.  So then I calculated that 1040 *16000 for a total of 164800. Then dividing this by 600 miles. I came to the answer that Mr Montero needed to put 12850 more gallons in his tank.

{"text": "The correct answer is 128.\n\n### Input 2:In three weeks, there were 300 new people born in the town, how many had been born in the same amount of time and were alive?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe same question can be asked as: How many people were born and are alive in the same amount as time? the answer is 150, since the question asks how many have been born and are alive, and the population was growing by 300 in three weeks, then the growth during the population would be 300/week, since by the end of the week there would be 600 more people then previously, and then the population grows by another 300 more people the second week, therefore there would be 900 more people then originally, but then after the week ends there would be 1200 people that were born than then end of the week was, and then the population doubles which means that then end of the second week there would be 2400 more people, and then to find how many people were alive at the end of the time period we subtract 900-2400=1500, therefore 900/3 = 300.\n\n### Question:If a town's population double itself in 5 years, then what will it be in 15 years?\n\n### Solution:\nSince the population doubles itself in five years, then in order for the population to double itself again after 10 years (10-5=5), the town would need to have doubled its population by 10 years. And then there will be 200 more people that are born then there were at the beginning of the the year, but since then there were 200 births, then that amount times 2 years (10-10) is 400. And since the population doubles, and then also because they are 200 more then there were at the start of the 10 years, to double the population 10 years, and then at the end of 10 years there are 400 more people that were born (200 years old + 200 years old).

Let's take the first step to find the square footage first: To calculate the square footage of each side, I'm using the formula length x length=width x height. The width of which is to the length of the rectangle greater than the heights. Now let's take 6 as the length and 3 as the width.\n\nThen, 62=3 x 2\n\nLet's do one more addition: 6 + 6=12\n\n6+32=38\n\n12+38=50\n\n6+6=12 and the question says \"the length is three inches greater than its width\" which means that the width is bigger than the length.

{"text": "35\n\n### Justification:I first broke down the problem using the following equation. The number of blowfish = 14, because there were 26 blowfish before the 14 of 26 (26/2) were in the display tank and 12 were left in the original tank. The number of clown fish = 10, because there were 40 clown fish before the 16 stayed and 14 went with the blowfish in the original tank. Now that the clown fish went back into the original tank, 16/2 = 8 are left.\n\nThe solution is = 14 + 8 + 32 = 44. The question asked how many were in the display tank, and 44 were there, so there are 35.\n  \n### Input:The students at a school are divided into two classes, with equal numbers of boys and girls. A test is administered and it is scored by class for 50% of the marks. Class 2 scores all zero and class 1 gets 92% of the marks.  How much is taken off for each incorrect answer?\n\n### Output:0\n\n### Response\nFirst: I multiplied by the number of points earned by 2 classes times the amount of points taken off if someone answers incorrectly, then I subtracted 5 times the amount of points off by half and added 2.\n\nSolution: 92% of 50% = 46.1%\n\nThen: 50% - 47.5% = 2.5%\n\nNext: 0.25 * 2*50 = 12.5\n\nThen: 12.5 - 5 * 0.5 = 7.5.\n\nFinally: 7.5 + 2 = 9.5\n\n### Solution:There are 46.1 students per class and 92% of that number (46.1 *.92) is 42.1.\n\nEach test scores is multiplied by 50%. Then 46.1 is added to the other students, and the number is divided by two. But subtract 42.1 to get the amount of tests that are correct", "answer": " 16"}

So I need to divide the 13% by 223, which would be equal to four-fifths or 4/5. Now four-fifths is a little bit smaller than 223, so in order to make Sam's 9/10's bigger than 223 I need to multiply them both by 223. 9/10 is 5 times 73, but 4/5 is 4 times 44-plus 13, so 2/5 is the multiplication of 2 and 44-plus four, plus seven. So 2/5 times 223 is 770.7. The total of nine-tenths is 770 16, which is less than 770. 7, which is less than the 7, so I multiply 770 by 4.

{"text": "The number of boats that can race in a river is the floor of the function f(42) whose domain is natural numbers. If the formula to do this function is y=1/x^2-5/x-8, substitute 42 for y. There the function becomes x=62. Then, f(x) is equal to x-6, which is positive, meaning that when x = 62, f(x) = 1/f(x)-5/f(x)-8 = 1/1-5/x-. The left side of this equation is greater than or equal to zero. This means that y, which is x in this case, is greater than or equal than x, which means that x is greater than or equal six to six when f(x). This value is equal to 61 when f.(42) is substituted in the original formula of x=62. There are 61 boats that can race in the river.\n\n#### Submission Code:", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "319\n\n### Rationale:  Let's first find that the final weight is 167 pounds.  3 pounds is half of 6 pounds, so 3 pounds must be half of the weight of the package.  2 pounds is 1 pound less than (the other part) half of the weight of package, so 2 pounds must be half of (the other part) of half the weight.  So the weight is 6 pounds.  Next, the weight tripled, so 6 becomes 18 pounds.  2 pounds is half (the other part) 18, but the other part of 18 is 9 so 2 pounds is also 9 pounds, so now the weight is 9 pounds.  2 pounds will bring the weight to 11 pounds, but already it is 9 pounds, so only 2 pounds must be added, causing the weight to be 11 pounds.  2 pounds causes the weight to triple again, so it is now 33 pounds.  Since there are 9 pounds left, a double means 90 pounds.  Now, there are only 10 pounds left, 69 pounds to be exact, so another 2 pounds will cause the weight to be 71 pounds.\n\n### Input:[830 to 970 million pounds.] [The final weight of the box.]\n\n### Response:[167 pounds.]\n\n### Rational:\n###  Let's figure out the value of the final weight of the package.

At the beginning, there are m painkillers in his left bottle, and n-m painkillers in his right bottle. Each day, he takes two painkillers from his right bottle and two painkillers from the left bottle. He takes m painkillers three times the first day, n-m times the second day, and n-2m painkillers the last day; so he takes (m+n-2m)  painkillers on the first day, (n+2n-2n) painkillers on the second day, and (n-2n)  painkillers, the third day. Because he takes m painkillers on the third day, he ends up with (2m - m = 2) of them. Thus, he ends up with two painkillers from each bottle and with the entire bottle of painkillers. Each day, he removes more and more of the painkillers. Therefore, in the last bottle, he will have m painkillers, while in the other bottles there will be fewer painkillers. In the first bottle, he will end up with m, m-1, m-2,....  for a total of (2m-m =) 2m painkillers. In this bottle, there will only be 1/2 of what is in the previous bottle. Therefore, the total amount of painkillers left in all the bottles is the sum of all of them and this can be found, when summing from 1 to m, to be 2.

The first part of the instruction reads as follows: \"Write an answer that will do the task.\"\n\nThis means that we need to write an answer that will do - in this case - the task listed in the instruction.\n2. The second part of the instruction reads, \"Ask the student to do the task.\"\n3. The third part of the instruction reads: \"the student should be able to answer this question.\"\n\nThe fourth part reads: Answer:\n\n```C\nB\nBecause there are not any quarters with a face value of $0.14, 12 of Winston's 14 quarters account for a value of $0.42.\n\nThus, Winston ends up with $0.42 - 0.5 = $0.41.\n```\n\nIn the response, in the first step, we need to \"do the task.\" As a way of making sure to do what we want to do, we define a name for the task, write the function of the task in the name, and then call the function.\n\n4. The response is an example of how programmers do the following in each computer language. They first write a name for the task in a function. The then define the function in the function. And finally, they can go ahead and program the function in one of several ways.\n\n5. This program also demonstrates the programming concept of using variables, which are represented by the `$` symbol. In this example, the variables represent quantities, which can be used at many different times during the program. For example, the variable `$left = 0;` tells the program to leave a \"zero\". The variable `$remaining` holds the value of the amount Winston has spent.\n\n6. In the above program, the variable `$left` is the result of an expression that is evaluated inside a set of parentheses. It holds the value of `42-0.5`.\n\n7.

The value is `20`.\n\nOnce we've done that, we need to multiply `20` by `4` to get the total amount of muffins, `80`.\n\nNext we will find the modulo of this answer to make sure that its divisible by 3.\n\nFor division by two, we use the modulo formulae `b % n`.\n\nThe value of `n` is `4`:\n`80 % 4` = 2, which is divisible by 3, `80 % 3 = 0`.\n\n`b % n` where `80 % 4 = 2`, `b = 80`.\n\n### Input:(Question)\n#### Write a python program to find the sum of two numbers that is equal to the smaller of the two numbers but greater than the larger.\n\n**Input**\n\nEx 1 : Input two Natural number N, M (0 <= N, M < 32000)\n\nEx 2: Input two Integer N M (2 <= N <1000000, 2 <= M<50)\n\n#### Code\n\n```\ndef sum(n, m):\n    # Write your code here\n    s=n\n    nb=s/m\n    while nb!=n:\n        nb=nb+1\n        s=s+nb\n    return s-m\ndef main():\n#enter 2 natural numbers\n    n,m=input().split()\n    print(sum(int(n),int(m)))\nif __name__=='__main__':\n    main()\n```\n**Output**:\nInput : 6, 2 \nOutput : 4\n```\n\n### Input::(Question)\nGiven an array of Integers (positive and negative integers).

{"text": "Her pool has the same amount of water leaked out as was put in.  Which is to say the leak is not the issue.  The amount put in is 60 gallons. Letting t be the time, then the leak is 0.1 gallon per minute.  This is per interval, and not total, because the leak is over all the time.  There is no leak while the pool is filling up, so that is a problem. Let us solve the problem in another way.  There are 60 gallons added in each interval of 60 gallons, which is 1 second.  Thus we get 0.1 gallong * 60 seconds = 6 gallons leak per second\n\n### Question:\n\n### Problem:\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Demographic\n\n### Question 17", "answer": " 40"}

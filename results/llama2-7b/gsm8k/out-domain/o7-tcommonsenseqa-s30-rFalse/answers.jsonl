{"text": "7\n\ninput:A man named Bill had a pet dog named Sam.  One day Bill decided to buy some dog food.  He found himself at the local pet store.  The pet store employee, Larry, was very helpful and took the time to explain Bill's dog's dietary needs.  Bill noticed 6 different flavors of dog food, and at first it was hard to decide which dog food to buy.  But Larry mentioned Sam might not be as picky with his food as Dean, and he would probably like any flavor of food.  So Bill picked out some chicken, bacon, and egg and some baked potato dog food, and they said goodbye to Larry.   When Bill got home, he was eager to feed his dog.  So he got out 2 bowls.  One bowl was small and one bowl was large.  He filled both bowls to almost the top and they were sitting there, waiting for him.   But then Bill noticed Sam was nowhere to be found.  Bill called out for Sam, but after a few minutes there was still no answer.   Bill was worried Sam was not feeling too good, so he looked around the house.  Eventually, Sam wandered into view.  He seemed a little embarrassed but happy he found food to eat.  Bill, being the nice owner that he was, decided to have some fun.  He took a bite out of each bowl.  Each bowl was so full, the liquid spilled everywhere and all over his chin.  Bill quickly wiped his chin with his shirt.  Sam, looking up at Bill, saw some of the food had fallen onto the floor, which prompted him to take a bite out of the floor.  Realizing his dog probably liked the food, he tried to feed him some more, although he had to feed him really slowly because he is a small dog.  Then Sam ate another bite out of the ground.  The dog food was starting to make Bill's stomach upset.  He realized he had some stomach upset, that he probably shouldn't have filled his bowl as full as he could.  He realized Sam didn't like it as much as he thought.  It was probably better to buy a smaller bag next time.  Bill sat there, thinking of how much he had.", "answer": " 11"}

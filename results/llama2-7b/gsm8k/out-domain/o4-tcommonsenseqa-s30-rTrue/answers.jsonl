{"text": "1) The questions asks about the total cost of ingredients for the charcuterie.\n2) We begin by noting that the ingredients are being bought in quantities of a certain size.\n3) The cheddar cheese costs $10. It is being bought in quantities of 2 pounds.\n4) The cream cheese costs half the price of the cheese, or $5. That means that they're being bought individually.\n5) The cold cuts cost $20 each. They are also being bought individually\n6) The problem states that the total cost for the ingredients should be found.\n7) Now, we can create an \"ingredients\" equation which gives us a total cost for the ingedients if we know their quantities. For example:\n$20 is equal to 1 $20 cold cut\n$10 is equal to 2 2-pound cheddar cheese\n$5 is equal to 1 1-pound cream cheese, and thus\n$100 is equal to 3 2-pound cheeses and 3 1-pound cheeses\n8) We need the total cost for the cheeses and cold cuts. In other words, we need a equation for the total cost of two of these variables.\n9) After evaluating the question carefully, we note that what is given is the total cost for the cheddar cheeses. We write down the solution:\n$20 + $100 = $120\n10) Now, take the total cost of the cheddar and add the cost of the cream cheese:\n$120 + $5 = $125\n11) Now, we need to use the equation for the quantities for the cold cuts to solve for the total cost:\n$100 + $20 =$120\n12) So the solution was $125, which can be used in the initial question to solve. \n13. So the total cost comes to $60\nSo the answer is D: $60", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "Intermediate Math: I was given the problem \"It is Roger\u2019s Turn...\"; which asks: How many packs of Trail Mix does he need to buy in order to be sure that everyone gets one? The question is about being certain that each person is offered one pack of trail mix. However, all of them don't have to end up with one. Because some of Roger's baseball team members do not eat trail mix, or any snacks, for that matter. Roger's baseball team is of 13 people, not counting the coaches and helpers. We can say that the question is in relation to the baseball team of 13 people; but not about the baseball team of 25 people, including the coaches, and helpers (13+3+2=18 people).\nThe solution I did to solve the problem, is that for each pack of trail mix, I added 13, because there are 13 members on the team. If Roger buys one pack of trail mix, the first 13 people will get one pack. The other members will get less than one pack. Even though he is sure that everyone will get one. Roger has to buy enough trail mix for the entire team, to be sure that each one has a pack of trail mix.\nSo, for 13 people to get one pack of trail mix; he needs to buy 13 packs of trail mix.\nMy solution for the problem was to buy 13+1 pack of trail mix. For example: 13 packs means that each member of the team gets exactly one pack, but there must be some pack to give for those who don't eat trail mix, so they won't be left without a pack of trail mix in their hands.\nSo my answer is: Roger needs to buy 14 packs of trail mix for the 16 members; who would all get one pack each.

{"text": "Begin by setting variables KB = number of books borrowed by Krystian, DA = the days' average number of borrowed books, and F = the number of days in a given week. \n1. Now, the word \"borrows\" suggests that Krystian may not have borrowed any books on a given day (or not have returned any on a given day), in which case the average for that day will be considered zero.\n2. So, we need to make adjustments to the daily average by considering zeros and considering whether borrowing was not done on some days. In case the average is considered a number of books, then we have, DA = 0. Otherwise, DA = -1.\n3. From the question statement, it appears that Krystian borrows more books every Friday than the daily average. If we want to find the number of days Krystian borrower 40 books on average during the week, then we must subtract Friday. In other words, the number of days is 40-F, where F is the number of days he borrowed 40 books on the daily average.\n4. Therefore, we can write out the formula for KB as KB = 40-F * DA\n5. We plug in the values and get KB = 4 - F * 0.4, or KB = 16-F\n6. From the equation, we know that DA = -1 implies that the number of days KB = 17.\n7. To find the number of borrowed books in a week, we plug the value of DA = -1 and substitute KB = 18, we get KB = 1 * 16 - 1 or KB = 29 books. \n8. To summarize, the answer is that Krystian takes 29 books in one week.\n\nInput: In the last 12 months, a company issued 7920 shares of stock.

The statement begins by stating that a certain box contains certain amounts of marbles.\n6. From this, we can infer the following about the answer:\n7. We can narrow the choices down to three because the box contains five yellow marble choices, three green choices, and four red choices\n8. That makes the choices 0 or 7or8, 2 and 5 or 6.\n9. We can eliminate 8 because the number in question is at least 12, and 2 because it states there are no black marbles.\n10.

The question is asking about the amount of money left for managing public space, not about the amount of money spent on public spaces.\n5. So option 2 can not be the answer.\n6. There may be some overlap between managing public space and policing. If police manage public spaces as part of their job, then choosing that the amount left for managing public is the same as the amount left for policing is a reasonable thing to do.\n7. Another alternative is to take $32 million - $12 million - $16 million = $10 million.\n7.

{"text": "1. The question is asking for the annual grape requirement of Borris liquor store based on its data that it consumes 90 kiloggrages and produce 110 kgs of wine every 6 months and is going to increase it's wine production by 20 percent.\n2. Intermediate Reasoning steps :\n3. Begin by analyzing what each number in the question represents. We can recognize a \"kilo\" in the word \"kilograms\" and the word \"grams\" is just a unit of weight.\n4. Next, we can recognize that \"6 months\" here actually represents half a year. That means 6 months equals half a year in the context of this question.\n5. The question then gives us two important pieces of information: we know the grape consumption rate is 90 kgs per 6 months, and we know that the store is going to increase its production by 20%.\n6. To find Boris liquor store's annual consumption per year, we can multiply 90 kgs by the time period in a year. A year is 12 months, so we can multiply 9 kg per month by 12.\n7. So we end up with 108 kg, which is close to 115 kgs but not the same because we are taking into account the time period.\n8. We now have the information we need to answer the question. Boris liquor store produces about 108 kg of wine per year.\n9. To answer the question specifically, what is 108 kg times 1.2, or 1.2 times 108? 120. So we get the answer 120 kgs, 2.4 times as much as what the store produces now.\nSo 120kgs of grapes used will be used by Borris.\nSo the final  answer is 120 kils of grapes\n\nInput: One of five teenagers did not take part in the study, a different factor may be related to the outcome.

{"text": "1. Let's decompose the problem into smaller portions or steps to simplify the problem and make solving easier.\n2. The first step, the context of a Christmas party, suggests a guest list that contains a lot of people.\n3. The second step, the fact that every guest brings a plus one, indicates that half of the guests already require two plates.\n4. The next step would be to determine how many guests would need a plate. So for that, we need to calculate the amount of guests that would not bring a plus one and therefore need just one plate.\n5. In the given context, we know that these are the guests who can come only by themselves, indicating these guests are the ones who want to show up alone. This suggests that there might be around 7(1/2) or 3 and half guests, each of them needs to be invited using just one plate. That means just half of the plates are used to invite one guest to show up alone, so 1 1/2 plates are available for the whole purpose of inviting these guests.\n6. Now, we have to check how many guests would not be accompanying any plus one. To find this out, we need to subtract the total number of guests who would bring a plus one, from the total number of guests invited. This indicates that the 20 guests who invite their plus ones use up 35 plates. So, we have to subtract 35 from 30, leaving 5 plates. This means 5 plates are left over.\n7. However, this solution is not entirely correct as the context of the Christmas party seems to indicate that the 20 who invite their plus one are not counting for this 5 plates. \n8. Then there is a solution where we have to check the number of plates that every guest needs. From the context of the party, we know that a lot of guests would be attending. Considering this, we have to think of the number of guests who will need just one plate. From the math mentioned earlier, this would be 3 and half guests. So the number of plates needed for those 3 and half guests would be 1 1/12, adding to the previous one plate, making a total of 3 plates.\n9.

In addition, the original question also tells us Maude will be 6 times as old as Anne will be.\n3. This enables us to solve for x and determine Anne's age.\n4. First, we can simplify the equation. The statement says Anne will be two times older than Maude, so in order to solve this equation we can multiply both sides by 2, leaving us with:\n```\n x = 2 * Maude\n```\n5. Next, we can simplify the second expression. We know that Maude will be 3 times as old as Anne when Anne is 2 \n```\n x = Maude * 3\n```\n6. Adding the two equations above we can determine that  ```\nx= 3M + 2```\n7. Inverse the equation to determine the solution of the equation: ````\n - 3M - 2 = 0\n\n\n - (3M +2) = 0\n\n - 3M = -2 [remember 5 * -1 = -5].\n\n - M = -6/3\n - Thus, Anne will be -6/3 x 8.\n8.

From this information, we can eliminate options 3 and 4, as neither is 5 feet high.\n3.  Option 2, A: Barry must be 5 feet high, would eliminate either Larry or Barry because neither of them is 5 feet, so this is not a valid option either.\n4.  Option 5, C: Barry is 20% shorter than Larry can also be eliminated because either Larry or Barry needs to be able to reach 5 feet from the tree without the other.\n5.  Therefore, Option 1, A: Barry is tall enough. Choice A is correct because Barry will be able to reach a total of 5 feet high through 20% less of Larry's height. However, the choice isn't enough to give a complete answer because the problem statement isn't 100% clear. We can assume if Barry reached 5 feet that Larry could still reach the top in comparison to the original statement.\n6.  Option 3, D: Barry is tall for his age. We can assume that Larry is of the same age and size as Barry, but in the case that he is not, Barry may be considered of a larger stature of his age because he can successfully reach the top of the apple tree. Also, since we want to prove that Barry can reach 5 feet by climbing on Larry's shoulders. Barry cannot be considered too tall for his age since only his height is important in this comparison.\n7.  Option 6, E: Larry can reach 6 feet. This option is incorrect because 5 feet is indeed the most that can be reached. Larry's additional height of 6 feet will only bring them closer to this reach height so Larry and Barry still won't be able to grab any of these apples. Furthermore, adding 6 feet to Barry's height would only result in Larry being able to reach a total high of 6 feet through Barry's shoulders and not the current 5 feet, because the additional height of each one could only reach the 5 feet mark.

{"text": "1. The first thing we need to do is break the problem down into a smaller one by finding out how much time Carlotta spends on each activity. We can do this by using the following rule: The given information is that she spends 3 minutes practicing in addition to each minute she spends on stage, but since the final performance is 6 minutes and the total amount of time she spends is greater than 6 minutes, we can deduce that she spends 1 minute practicing and 5 more minutes throwing tantrums during those 6 minutes on stage.\n2. The second thing we need to do for this problem is to multiply the amount of time spent performing each activity, in minutes, by the number of minutes spent performing that activity.\n3. First, we need to find how many minutes Carlotta spends practicing. The given information is that for each minute she sings on stage, she spends 3 more minutes practicing. However, since the total amount of time spent is more than 6 minutes, it may include a total of 1 minute performing. In other words, Carlotta spends 1 minute performing and 6 minutes practicing.\n4. Next, we need to find the amount of time Carlotta spents throwing tantrums. According to the question, she spends an addition 5 minutes practicing in addition for each minute she spends singing on stage, but since 1 minute is already spent singing, Carlotta will spend 5 other minutes throwing tantrums.\n5. Last, we have to find the amount of minutes that she spends singing in total. The total amount of time spent singing adds up to be more than 6 minutes.\n6. Next, we can multiple Carlotta's time spent practicing and singing by 1 and her time spent throwing tantrums by 5.\n7. Therefore 1\u00d70+5\u00d76+0\u00d75=5, so the answer is 5 which says that Carlotta spends five additional minutes throwing tantrums in addition to the five minutes she spends on stage and the five minutes she spents practicing because by the given information that was given to us it states that for every minute that she sings on stage during her performance, she spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums and 3 minutes practicing.\nSo the final number is 5 which is", "answer": " 54"}

Doughnuts each person get = 2D-1\nThe equation is:\n\n\\(x(2D-1)\\over 8\\)\n\n= x+1/8 (x is the number of doughnut only in one person which means x is in subtraction to calculate each person who get the doughnut, the amount of doughnut each people got is only one, so it is only x and not x(2d-1))\n\nx(2D- 5 /8)= x+1/8\n\nx(3 /8)= x+ 1/8\n\n(3/8)(x) = (1/8)\n\n3x = 1/8\nx = 8/3 = 2/3\n= 2/3 Dozen doughnuts\nFor the first person, it is easy to convert 9 doughnuts in dozens. It is 5 dozens doughnuts. And for second person, it is 5 dozons doughnuts, because that is the case of share the doughnnuts evenly.\nSo, each person got 2 from (8/3)-1 which equal to 23/8 doughnuts which equal to 1/3 dozons doughnut.\nSo, answer is 8/3 and 5/3 dozons\n\nSo the final answer should be 14 / 3 Dozen Doughnuts\n\nOutput: What are half of 9 and 6 added together?\nOutput: The", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "1) The problem describes a situation in which Kantana typically purchases a certain number of chocolates each week, which is 2 chocolats for herself and 1 chocolat for her sister. With this information, we can establish the foundation of the problem with the following diagram.\n2) From the diagram above, we can observe there are two variables or parameters in the problem, x and t.\n3) x is the number of chocolats Kantana buys in a week.\n4) t is the total number of weeks of the month.\n5) Based on the information above, we can deduce based on the diagram above that the total number of week or the parameter t is given as 4.\n6) Using the information and steps detailed so far, we can formulate a formula for the total number of chocolat, which can be expressed as:\nt(x + x + x +1 ).\n7) Now that we have the total number of cholats, we can then move on to solving for the total number of weeks. We can do this using the same reasoning approach and method by taking the reciprocal of the total number of chlolats, which can be expressed numerically as:\nT=4. We can express the total number of weeks as T= 4.\n8) Now, to calculate the number of cholates Kantana purchased in a week, we can simply subtract 3 from the total number of weeks to get 1.\n9) Substituting the value for t with 4 and substituting 1 for the number of weeks, we can express the number of cholats Kantana bought for the month as:\nx = 10.\n10) Thus, the answer is that Kantana purchased 10 cholates for the month in this month.\nSo the final answers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11,12,13,14,15,111\n\n### Question 1:\n\n### Question Title:\n\nAnswer the following question.\nInput: A is for apple B is for bear C is for car D is for dog E is for elephant F is for frog G is for giraffe H is for horse I is for insect J is for jel", "answer": " 22"}

So we have $$ 100 + 80 = 125 + 1280$$ $$100 + 5\\times 80 = 85 + 12\\times 80$$ $$ 15 + 12 + 960 =170 + 960$$ $$170+960>170+970$$ This shows that the total profit is more than the total price of all paintings. So to get the profit we need to subtract paintings price from the price of painting.\n3) $$ \\begin{aligned} 170+9060 & > 170+ 970 \\\\ $170+175+960+9061& > 170 \\\\ $960 & < 970 & \\\\ 5 \\times 80 & + 8 \\times 80& = 35+64 \\\\ $120 & - 970 \\\\ 950 & > 970 \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$\n4) So at this art show, Michael made $950 profit.\nSo the final answers are $$ \\begin{aligned}(Total profit)=\\\\ 12 \\times 80 + (5 \\times (100 - 80)) \\\\ 120 + (5\\times (25)) \\\\ 1260 & = 950 \\\\ \\end{align} $$\nSo the final answer are $1260.\n\n### Instruction:If a number decre", "answer": " 1140"}

This does not qualify as a compound.\n3) Option B: truck - This is a compound formed by three parts, but it is not a combination of two or more parts because it does not have a single underlying part to form it. To find a compound, we have to look for two or more distinct parts.\n4) Option C: cow - In this case, the cow is made up of one part, the body (\"cow body\"), which is also the main underlying part of the compound cow + grass = cow + cow grass.\n5) Option D: butterfly - A butterfly is a single creature, and although it can be broken down into several parts, the whole still consists of only one element.\n6) Then, option E: cowboy - The cowboy is made up of two parts: cow + boy.\n7) So, the cowboy, which involves two distinct elements, is an example of a valid compound.\n8)", "answer": " 5"}

In order to solve the problem, we must interpret the given information and draw a logical conclusion.\n2. The initial amount is in the phrase \u201cher piggy bank\u201d.\n3. We determine that Isabel has the money in her pigty bank and that she spent half the amount. This means Isabel has half of her original amount remaining. We note that the initial amount is in dollars, so we convert one half of this amount to dollars and solve for the original amount. We find our original amount is $105.\n4. Now, Isabel buys a toy with some of her remaining money and then buys a book with the rest of the remaining money.\n5. We recognize that Isabel buys what she can afford with the money she has left, which tells us that she must have spent some of her remaining money to buy the toy.\n6. We can find the amount of money that she spent on the toy by subtracting the money she spent to buy the toy from the amount of money she had left.\n7. Since we are given that Isabel has $51 left after she buys a book, we conclude that Isabel spent $26 on the book and $22 on the toy.\n8. Now, we subtract $22 from $51 to find the initial amount, since $22 is the amount that Isabel spent on the toy and $26 is her remaining amount after buying a book.

Now we need to find out what is the most appropriate option, it is important to realize that the question specifies that Leo gave a quarter of their collection to the kid, which means that Leo contributed just over 4 shells.\n7. Thus, Option E, 76 - Leo 24 => Total: 76 - 24 + 12 + 16 = 68 => 68 + 16 = (84 - Leo's 24) => 84 + (50 + 16) => 150\n8. Thus, Leo made a donation of 24 + 50 + 18 = 92 seashells = 92 / 4 = 23 quarters, as he gave 24 to the child and kept 5 quarters for himself.\nTherefore, Leo's contribution, according to the question, is 23 quarters => 23 quarters + 24 quarters = 47\n9. Option E, 68 shells, is the answer, which is confirmed by subtracting the donated shells from Henry and Leo", "answer": " 53"}

Options A: \"purchase vegetables\" B: \"chicken\" D: \"bacon or option F: \"hummus\" do not seem like options likely to be chosen from this grocery list of items, so they can be ruled out.\nStep4: Applying intermediate reasoning, we could determine that one container of hummus could be bought for $60, leaving $20 of the remaining $60 remaining to purchase apples.\nStep5: After considering the scenario in step4, we can determine that Option C: \"how many apples\" is in fact the best answer, as this scenario could determine a purchase option of that many apples.\nStep6: Therefore, the answer is Option C: \"how man apples\".\n\nSo the final answer was C: How many Apples\n\nInput: John had a good grade on a test.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the number of peaches that Brenda has left after sorting and discarding the ones that meet certain criteria.\n2. Analyzing all the given choices:\n3. First, we must note that this is a math question and therefore cannot be answered by option C: guess because we don't know how many peaches she starts with.\n4. Second, we find that option B: 45 is unreasonable for the same reason, since 100 peaches are left, only 60 are good. A logical value that makes sense would be about 40, not 45.\n5. Next, we find that 10 peaches being too small is a relatively small value, and it is unlikely that Brenda would have to discard more than 10 of them. This indicates that Choice A: 35 does not make logical sense.\n6. So, the only remaining option is D: 25, because 10 peaches for being too small is less than 15 and therefore accounts for all the peaches Brenda has to throw away and still leaves 60 of the remaining 250 to be fresh.

Subtract the amount of profit from the earnings 4. Subtract the number of months that you have to the original number, if you have two months, subtract 2 to the original number 5. multiply every month by 12 and add the answer to 1\nOutput: Let consider below steps: 1. Add one to every month this is a non sense idea. this will increase the monthly revenue. 2. Multiple each (A month) by 12 this is also a non sense idea. A month is a unit of time and every unit of time have a different value which is the whole period of time. So how we can multiply same time unit with different number? 3.

The first part of finding the answer is to compare a normal doctor's $200 charge with the discount clinic's cost - $200 is 140% of $140, so it takes two visits to the discount clinif for the savings to equal a visit to the normal doctor.\n3. Therefore, he saves $140 after two visits ($140 = 100$ + 40%). \n4.

Begin by breaking down the words in the sentence - the words \"to the\", \"two power\" and \"in\" are key to answering the question. It indicates that our answer must be equal to 2 x 2 multiplied by 2.\n2. To multiply two numbers, you must first group them together, like this: 2 x 2.\n3. Finally, we can figure out our answer by plugging in each combination of our numbers and multiplying two at a time. 2 x 2 = 4; 2 x 4 = 8; etc. \n4. 2 x 8 = 16 2 x 16 = 32    2 x 32 = 64 2 x 64 = 128 2 x 128 = 256.    2 x 256 = 512   2 x 512 = 1024 2 x 1024 = 2048  2 x 2048 = 4096\n5.

{"text": "1. The question asks how many pickle slices Ron eats, given certain data about the relationship between Sammy, Tammy, and Ron.\n2. Note that Sammy, Tammy and Ron do not eat the same amount of pickles.  Let's work through the problem line by line.\n3. We begin with the first statement, that Sammy can eat 1 5 pickle slices, so the correct choice is 1 5.\n4. The second statement gives us the information that Tammy can eat twice that of Sammy, or 2 x 1 5 = 30.\n5. We multiply Tammy's pickle slice count by 2, which results in 3 8.\n6. The third statement tells us that Ron eats 2 0% fewer pickle slices than Tammy does.  In reverse, this means that Tammy counts 2 0% more pickle slices than Ron does.  We can use the original Tammy pickle slice count of 3 8.  Subtract 2 0% to get 3621, which rounds to 3 6 and then multiply Ron by 2 to get 7 2.\n7. Subtracting 7 2 from 3 6 gives us an answer of 2 6 pickle slices.  \n8.

Since there is 1 card not used, 1 is left which takes 75 tooth picks, there is a total of 4,025 toothpicks in 1 deck of cards and 4025/52 =87 cards per deck.\nStep 3. Since there is 52 cards so we can write 52 x 87 cards = 4,704\nStep 4. We already know how many cards Eugene used =>87.\nSo now to get the no. of box Eugene used let us write => 4,700/450 = 10.4 cards per box.\nSo 10.4 x 87 = 911.6 cards used in a box.\nSo 4025 - 911. 6 = 3113.4 tooth picks in a box.\nStep 5.We got the answer in Step four.\nStep 6.

Analyzing the options presented in the problem, A) Apple and peach trees are each planted in the orchid of the grange poser farm, we can conclude that the orchard in fact has 75 fruit trees, not 30. Since the orchard has 75 fruit, we can't simply take 150 X 30 and 65 X 45 to get the total mass of all the fruit, since there is no total mass given.\n6.

We will use the formula for calculating sales tax and the formula for calculating the percentage change in value to solve this problem.\n3. The formula for calculating sales tax is (total sales - taxes collected)/total sales, which we will use to calculate the surplus as well.\nb. In the first table the given numbers are profit = $960 and $1.36/item. For calculating tax and determining surplus, the tax rate, number of items sold, and the total cost of sales are all provided in the table, so we just need the final value which is $136.\n4. We can use the given formula to calculate the sales tax for that value of $960:\n\n$$\n\\dfrac{136-135}{136} = 0.0136 = 1.36\\%\n$$\n\n5. Therefore, the tax collected is 1.36%, which means that we will take this percentage from the total amount to determine the amount of money she made above her goal, so she made $136.01 more than she needed.\nc. In order to determine the percentage, we subtract 1.36 from 100 to get 98.64:\n\n$$\n100\\% - 1.36 = 98.6\n$$\n\nd. Then, divide the result, 98.6, by the profit, $960, and we get 0.0986.

Option A: A man and his children traveled 2,000 miles by a direct path and arrived at destination B. The remaining remaining 700 miles traveled is 700-1,300 = -600 miles. Thus the distance must be greater than 2,001 miles. So this can be eliminated.\n2. Option B: The distance could be 300 miles. It is true. The total number of miles he traveled is 1,300 + 700 + 1000 = 3,000 miles. Therefore the distance between two point can be B. \n3. Now let's move on to C. \nOption C: Man and his kids travelled by car and air but the total trip ended at 1,000 miles in trip. So 700 +700+1000 =1600 miles in total. He then drove 70 miles to his kids. So here it will be 1,600 + (1,600-70)=1,670. So at destination B he is at least 60 miles away from the starting point thus it can be eliminated. \nOption D: Man and his kiddos travelled 2,0", "answer": " 240"}
{"text": "1)The first step to solve this problem is to identify the data types of each variable. The independent variable, which is constant, is a number, a rational number, an irrational number, a real number, and a floating-point number. The dependent variable, which is the sum or difference of the independent variable and another number, is a real number, especially a rational number: a natural number with a nonzero integer as its denominator, or a whole number greater than one with a decimal portion.\n2) Let \"t\" be the number of years in one unit.\n3) The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable that is presented in this question is an exact mathematical relationship, which can be expressed using a specific equation.\n4) The independent variable is given and will always be the same value, while the dependent variable has the format of n (n is the total independent variable).\n5) The total independent variable equals the dependent variable.\n6) The total number of movies that the two companies produce in 5 years is equal to \"t\" (total of independent variable) = (25 * t)+220.\n7) Thus, we can solve the question by plugging the values for the given independent variable and the total of independent variable to our equation to find the dependent outcome value.\n8) So, 25 times 5 is 125, 220 plus 125 equals 345.

Start by analyzing the problem statement and determining key variables or aspects that may be important for solving the question.\n2. Notice that the problem mentions three individual characters: Ittymangnaro, Kinknook and Oomyapek.  This suggests that the question will focus on the food each individual receives.\n3. The problem also mentions the number of fish eyes consumed by each individual, and what the total quantity of fish will be for the entire family.  This means that we must analyze the food allocation for each individual to solve the problem.\n4. Since the problem mentions three people, we have a few options for allocating the fishing among the individuals:\ni) Ittymangano, Kinknook And Oomyapeck each receive an equal portion: Ittymango is given 1 fish eye, Kinknook is gives 1 fish eye and Oomyapekc is given 22 fish eyes.

{"text": "1: This is a word problem. 2. We can start by understanding the key points in the question. There are four answers to the question. - In her third hour, she collected 32 coins. - In the next 2 hours, she collected 69 coins. - She gave 15 coins to her coworker. - She had 50 coins at the end of the fourth hour. 3. It is possible to solve the question using the information we are given already and using the information that is not given. In our problem, if we know the number of coins she collected in the first hour, we can solve for the other hour's collections. So, 15 coins were collected in the first hour.\n4. To solve for the second hour, we can use the rule of three. This principle involves multiplying a number by three and subtracting the result from said number, which reduces by one if the result is not an even number, to find the missing middle value in the sequence. Here, Joanne collected 32 coinsthe second hour, so the missing number is half of the last number, 16. We can then subtract 16 from 32 the same way we subtracted 15 from 15, and we arrive at a solution of 9. 5. Joanne collected 9 coins the third hour, so we subtract 9 from 32 and get 23 as our solution. We just solved for the fourth hour. 6. To solve for the third hour, we multiply as usual by three and subtract the result from the last number, which in this case is 23. So, if we start with 32 coins, we subtract 23, which gives 9, and the answer is 9 coins. 7. That leaves us with 32 coinsthat Joanne collected at the end of the 4th hour.\n8. By dividing by three, we can solve for each of the remaining unknowns. 9. So her total number of coins at the end is 32/3=11 coins.\n9. 1.

We saw that these questions tend to ask about a specific scenario wherein we must select the most suitable option based on the given information and reasoning. These questions can become challenging at times due to their abstract nature and the use of complex vocabulary, making it crucial to be mindful of the context, the meaning of the given options, and the relationship between them. It is essential to break down the questions into smaller parts, such as understanding the question itself, analyzing the options, eliminating out of scope and incomplete options, and identifying the appropriate or most logical option. These steps can help to develop a solid understanding of intermediate reasoning skills and avoid common pitfalls in this section. Moreover, practicing and solving previous solved questions from competitive exams like GRE, SSC CGL, Bank PO, etc, can help identify and improve weaknesses in reasoning skills and also help in time management.\n\nThanks for reading my blog please visit for more upcoming blogs: https://www.chankyainterview.com/", "answer": " 15"}

Now let us break down each of the choices in order to understand them well.\n\n2. Option A: The question states that dividing the lesson into one- third increments is a fair way to distribute their time equally among each. However, it is not specified whether dividing the lesson period into one-third periods is meant to imply multiple one-third periods during the same lesson period, or dividing the entire lesson time into one-third periods.\n3. Option B: Sixteen mini-lessons is not a fair way to distributes the time among each. It would simply not be possible to teach lessons that are 20 minutes or shorter.\n4. Option C: Seven minutes each is also not a fair way to apportion the time. Because the time given to each class of students does not match the time the other classrooms are given.\n5. Option F: Sixteen thirty-minute lessons is not viable. The question does not say that the teacher should teach sixteen lessons of three minutes each, and it also is not specified that the classrooms will be given the same amount of time.\n6", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "1. Start by identifying each of the quantities:\n2. The total number of minutes, the frequency of each cat's meows, and the total number of meows.\n3. Here, we know that there are 5 minutes in 5 minutes, so the total number of minutes is 5.\n4. Then, we need to find out how many times each cat meows:\n5. The first cat meows 3 times per minute, therefore there are 3 times in 5 minutes or 3 times 3 in 5 minutes.\n6. The second cat meows twice as frequently as the other cat, so it meows 4 times in 5 minutes. \n7. Similarly, the third cat meows at one-third the rate of the second cat, so it meow 2 times in 5 minutes (half of 4).\n8. Therefore, we can rewrite the frequency as:\n9. First cat:  3 times\n10. Second cat:  4 times\n11. Third cat:  2 times\n12. For the total number of meow, lets start with two variables: total meow 1 and total meow 2:\n13. To combine the two meows to get total meow1, there will be a multiplication.\n14. Then, total meow 2 will be 3 total meows because 3 times 3 equal 9.\n15. By multiplication, the total of each meow is 9+3 = 12. Then, the total meow is 12.\n16. So, we can rewrite the total meow statement as:\n17. Total meow 1:  9\n18. Total meow 2.  4\n19.

{"text": "Intermediate Reasoning Stepps:\n\n1. Break down this sentence into its component parts. In the first sentence, we are told that Janice's office is located on the third floor of the building. In the next sentence, we are told she has to go up three flights of stair to reach her office.\n2. The final sentence tells us that she walks up three flights of the stairs five times, and down three flights of the same stairs three times. As for the remainder of the time, we are told \"the remainder of the time\"? This means that she is probably taking the elevator some of the time, so we can assume that either she takes the elevator, or she takes the stairs, as there is no mention or implication of walking.\n3. As we've gathered so far, Janice walks up three flats of stairs five times, which adds up to 15 times she goes up stairs in a day.\n4. To this, we add three times she goes down stairs, making it 18 going up and down stairs in a day (15 + 3 = 18).\n5. We know there are three flights of stares in total, but we also know she uses the elevator the \"remainder of\". As she has to travel up three flights to reach her office, she is not going to use the elevator to travel down. Thus, she is not using the elevator, which means she is walking for the remainder, or 18 times a day.\n6. Put together, we know Janice travels 18 times (5 + 3 + 18 = 26) from her office. It can be seen that she travels up and down stairs 26 times in a day.\nSo the final Answer is 26.\nSo the final Answers is 26\n\nInput: What does the word \"diverse\" mean in a business context?

We cannot simply multiply this process by 3 because first we need to find the number rabbits that remain in each fox's territory at the end of the third week. \n10. We know that each fox consumes 4 weasels in the first week.\n11. If we divide by 4 the 100 weassles in the forest that are eaten by the foxes in those first 3 weeks we can see that there are:\n12. 25 weazzles left (25=100/4)\n13. For the second week, we know that there will be 4 weazzles in fox 1's territory and 25-2 in fox 2's territory.\n14. So for fox 2:\n15. 2 rabbits are eaten (2 rabbits were left in the forest and each fox eats 2 rabbits)\n16. There are 22 rabbits in the second week left, and if were to go through the same process and divide 25 wears by 4 we would have 6", "answer": " 96"}

To begin, let c*=20\n4. c* - b*=20\n5. When he pays c, his amount reduces by 20 and when he pays b, his amount will further reduce by the same. So we have two values, 0 and 20 and must find a value that will equal their difference. This will give the remaining amount of money after he pays Helen as 20-20, which is 0.\n6. When it comes to Benedict, he is paying for Ian's debt as Ian paid after Helen.\n7. The amount Benedict now has to pay Ian is c-h, meaning he is paying Ian c-c/2.\n8. Now since Benedict is paying Ian an amount that is less by 1/4th, Ian will be receiving an amount equal to 4times his original debt, which will be Benedict's payment\n9. c*=i*4\n10.

{"text": "1). The sentence presents a scenario wherein Frank has a certain amount of money, including one twenty-dollar bill, seven one-dollar bils, and more.\n2. The sentence then asks about the number of pounds of peanuts the given scenario would support per day.\n3. A good way to approach this question is to calculate how many pounds of peanuts Frank could buy altogether, considering that he has $11 in total.\n4. In addition to the one twenty-dollar note, which is the only bill of higher value in the scenario, he could buy 15 pounds of peanuts altogether with his lower-denomination bills.\n5. So, if Frank intended to eat all at once, his weight would be divided into 15 pounds of snack per day and would be shared evenly between each day of the week.\n6. Considering the statement that he intends to eat it in one week, he will be eating 2 pounds of fruit daily.\n7. From the context, we can also assume that he will most likely want to eat that much every day for the entire week or 2 pounds per day.\n8. So the number of pounds of snack Frank intends to eat in a single week would be 2 pounds per day multiplied by 14 days, or 28 pounds per week.\n9. Since these peanuts will be divided evenly among 14 days of the week, each day would get an average of 1 one pound.\n10.

The answer is really interesting, but first let's figure out why this is the answer. When looking at the question, we can see that B: winter is the only possibility that makes sense. If you think about it, we know that there were four seasons in the United States and two additional ones in England. So after those two additional seasons, there will be another set of four seasons and the same two additional seasons!\nSo the next set of four will be the same as the first set of four seasons: spring, fall, winter and summer.

The time it takes for it to make 12 batches to make 12 doughs and bake them in the oven, resulting in 24 pizzas.\n3) This means that if the oven can fit 2 pizza doughs per batch, the total number of batches needed to complete 12 pizzes would be six, because six batches to make 6 pizzas but the number of batches needed is 12.

It seems that Mille is preparing packs of snacks for her kindergarten students.\n2. The first step is to determine the total number of items to be divided. It appears that in each pack, Mille is including four times as many gold fish crackers as pretzels, and 32 pieces of suckers.\n3. In this example, there are 64 pretzles, so she needs to find 4x(64) = 256 goldfish and 64 * 35.2 = 2232 suckers to include in each pack of snacks.\n4. The second step is to figure out how many snack baggies to create. This can be done by dividing the number of total items by the number of items per baggie. In this case, 4x(256) goldfish is equal to 1024 goldfish, and 64 *35.2 is equal to 2288 suckers, which will be divided equally among eight baggies.\n5.

Then, we must add 32\u00b0 to the lower bound, and we are looking for the range of values for which the probability of skidding is given. This is from the equation, 5% of the time when it is below -32\u00b0 and 0\u00b0 degrees.\n4. So the first range we should look in is [-36, -32].\n5. Then we can calculate the probability by multiplying together the two pieces of information.\n6. The lower bound of the first range we need to check is -32.\n7. Now, we determine the upper bound of the second range we need to check, which can be calculated by adding the maximum possible skid range to the temperature value.

First, consider the first part of the problem: \"Lilith originally had Five Dozen Water Bottles that she needed to Sell...\" and the following statement: \"...However, at the Store, Lilith realized...\"\n2. Since the phrase \"...at the Store, Lilith...\" directly follows a paragraph about water bottles, it can be concluded that this information refers to a specific store in order to make sense. Furthermore, the phrase \"...Lilith realized...\" also indicates that some information has been revealed to her, which indicates that she now knows something that she did not do prior to this point in the problem.\n3. 3) With this information, we can conclude that the sale she made was at the grocery store, not a specialized convenience store or another type of location, which provides further context about her purchase price of $1.85.\n4. Additionally, this context indicates that \"Water bottles were sold for $1.85 in her town,\". Since she is already aware of this, and she can sell water bottles at that price, she does not have to worry about calculating or finding a new price that is lower than the original $1.85, because she can simply reduce the price without having to search for a lower figure and then factor in other expenses.\n\n2. After deciding that water bottles were being sold in her town at $1.85 each, Lilith realized that she needed to lower her price to sell them.\n5. To figure out her total earnings from the sale, we need to calculate the total value of all the items she sold. In order to reach her goal of $190, she needs to find a way to make up the difference of $21.65 between the total number of bottles she had and the amount she was able to sell. This can be calculated with the following equation:\n6. total money raised or earned = (Number of Bottles Sold / Number Of Bottle Available) x (amount per bottle - original price)\n7. Note that the answer in this equation is calculated by multiplying the amount of bottles sold by the cost of a single water bottle. This way we can factor in the reduced cost of each item, $1.85 rather than $2, without having to worry about finding an amount that is", "answer": " 9"}

Choices:  a) Do it sooner b) Do it later c) Make sure it's done yesterday d) Take it slowly e) Do it in moderation, so that it's neither too much nor too little\nOutput: The question asks for the most effective strategy for completing a task within the shortest time possible.\n2. Option A: Do it sooner - This is a strategy that could potentially lead to quicker completion of a task, especially if it's a time-sensitive activity.\n3. Considering that the options are organized from best to worst, options B: Do it later and E: Do it in moderation could not be better strategies than the first option since they clearly don't have the same time-saving effect as the first option.\n4. Therefore, we can rule out options b, c, and e.\n5. Option d: Take it slowly could effectively help save time if done intentionally. For example, if a person is in a hurry and plans to complete a time-sensitive task slowly, there's a good chance they could miss some critical details that require quicker reactions, possibly leading to mistakes or failure to complete the task on time.\n6. Hence, the best strategy for time-saving success is b: Do it sooner if it's a critical or time-sensitive task you need to complete quickly.\nSo the final strategy is b: Do it soon\n\nInput: The solution to this problem consists of three numbers", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "Intermediate Algebra Technique(s) Used: 1. Start by making a list of the information we know about the price of the goods purchased by Mary and Rose. We have the information about the number of goods bought by each person, as well as the prices of each item bought, and the number of items Mary and Rose bought.\n2. By using the formula for calculating the average, we can calculate the total amount spent on the items by each person. The average total amount spent by Mary is $880/2 = 440, and the average total amount spent by Rose is $430/2 = 215.\n3. Then, we can subtract the average amount spent by Rose from the average amount spent by Mary to find the amount Mary spent more than Rose. This difference will depend on the ratio of the number of items each person bought.\n4. Mary bought more items than Rose by a ratio of 2:1. A ratio is represented by a number with two numerators and one denominator. In this ratio, the numerators correspond to the number of pairs of sunglasseses and the number of pairs of jeans, and the denominator corresponds to the number of pairs both Mary and Rose bought, which is 4. By plugging 2 for the numerator and 4 for the denominator and converting the decimal of the average amount Rose bought into a fraction, we get the answer that Mary spent 105 more than Rose.\n5. We can confirm our answer by rewriting the given price formula to include the amounts spent by both Mary and Rose and the quantity of presents each person bought:\n        Mary spent 100 for 2 pairs of sunglassese and 100 for a pair of jeans\n        Mary spent 200 for 1 pair of jeans and 100 total\n        Rose spent 150 for 1 pair and 50 for 2 decks of basketball cards\n        Rose spent 200 total\n6.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the amount of fencing needed to enclose a rectangular flower bed at the city park, given that it has dimensions and width and is 1 meter shorter than its length.\n2. Interpret the dimensions to the equation 4m / 2(x - 1) = x / 2, where m is the width, x the length, and 4 is the width of the flowerbed.\n3. Now let's calculate the answer. We substitute for the variable (x - 1) (4 - 2x) = 2x - 4, setting the equation equal to zero, and solving for x, which gives x = 3 as the length of the flower bed. In this case, x = 4 or four meters is the width of the bed.\n4. To obtain the fence length, find the width of the flowered bed, 4 meters or x = 4, and subtract one meter from it, to get x - 1 = 3.

{"text": "1- The question asks about the probability of Andy winning both lawsuits compared with losing both lawsuits.\n2. Before we begin the calculations, we need to set up the problem. Let A represent the event that Andy wins the first lawsuit, B represent the event that Andy loses the first lawsuit, and C represent the event that Andy won both lawsuits. These events all represent the outcomes of the two lawsuits, with events A and C representing positive outcomes and events B and C representing negative outcomes.\n3. Let's evaluate the outcomes of each event. The probability of Andy winning the first lawsuit is 30%, and the probability of Andy losing it is 70%. By using addition and subtraction, we can calculate the probability of winning both lawsuits, which is 1/3.\n4. Now, let'd consider events B and C. The probability of Andy losing both lawsuits is half of the probability of losing the first lawsuit, or 0.5 times 0.7, for a total probability of 35%. The probability of Andy winning both cases is 1/3, or 0.3333, and subtracting that from 35% gives us the probability of Andy losing both cases (24.6666%).\n5. Now we need to calculate the difference between the probabilities of Andy winning the two lawsuits and the probabilities of Andy losing both. Using the probability of winning both case 35%, subtracting it from 33.3 and dividing the result by two gives us a 1.6666%, which would translate to 1/62. This can be interpreted as a 1.6% chance of winning both lawsuights, and a 61.0% chance of losing both lawsuits, for the probability of 0.33/1.6 or 20.46%, making losing both lawsuits 1.888 times more likely than winning both lawsuits. That is the final answer.\nSo the answer is: The probability of Andy losing the two lawsuits is 1.889 times more likely than the probability of winning them.", "answer": " 20"}

Remember that when you have a ratio, you need to know the units of measure for both values. In this case, we know that 500 milliliters of watermelon and 100 milli liters of cream are going to be used to make smoothies. That way, we can calculate how much watermelon and cream will be left after you make 6 servings in the ratio 1 watermelon : 100 of cream\n\nIf we were, for example, 6:3, it means the number of the unit on the denominator (the amount of the second part of the ratio) must be 3 or 0.3, meaning that after each 1/6: 0.3 of cream can be used to make a serving.\n\n1.

{"text": "Intermediate Solution Steps:\n\n* Find the difference between the times taken by Harry on Tuesday 90 min\n* Find the difference in speed between Thursday and Tuesday \n* Calculate the speed at which Harry can run\n\n1. We can start by dividing the speed, or number of meters that he ran, by the time. We see that it took Harry 10 min to run 10 meters.\n2. If we multiply the time spent running by the speed (10 min times the speed of 10 meters per minute), we can find the total distance that Harry ran by dividing this number by the time.\n3. The answer is, 90 min equals 90/10 = 9.00 km.\n4. Because we're not working with a whole number, the following equation is used to determine the percentage increase: (9.00/10) =.9 is equal to 90%.\n5. After accounting for the speed, we get the following equation to determine the number of meters Harry ran: 9.00/2 = 1/2 * 9.00 = 4.50 km\n6. To determine the speed of Harry, we simply divide the distance he ran by the time: 4.50/90 =.05 meters per minute = 50 mph\n\nSo the final answer 50 mph.", "answer": " 24"}

Determining how much ribbon is leftover is easier since there is no more division required.\n5.) The process of dividing by how many gifts are complete was to find the remainder value.\n6.) In this instance, the remainder is 16 which means there is 16 yards remaining. If there are 6 gifts remaining, 16 yards divided by 6 leaves a remainder of 1 yard. So there are two options here 1.) If the quantity of ribbon is 1, the answer is 1 or 2.) The quantity is anything greater than the above, so the quantity is 1 yard and the remainder value is 1, so the answer would be 1.\n7.)

Choice A, 18 pieces of fruit - If bucket A has 4, bucket B has 0, and bucket C has -9, then totaling the numbers that work adds up to 18 as the total pieces of fruit in the buckets.\n4. Choices B & C 15 pieces of fruit - If only bucket A had 4 more pieces of fruits than in bucket B, the total number of fats in the two buckets would be 8. Then adding 3 more pieces of fruits from bucket C, the total becomes 15.\n\n5. But this logic also applies to the choice D, 9 pieces of fruit.\n6. Looking at the initial set of fruits in each bucket, bucket A had 7 while bucket B had 4, then adding 4 more from bucket C gave 9 as the total for all three buckets. We can only include 15 pieces of fruits in the equation if bucket B has 9 more pieces of fruits.\n7. Lastly, let's analyze Choice E, 15 pieces of Fruit and Choice F, 9 pieces of Fruit.

{"text": "1. The question refers to a situation where a person buys $9 worth of flowers, $20 more worth of a clay pot, and $2 less worth of a bag of soil, and wants to know the total cost.\n2. Let's eliminate Option D, the bag of soil, as it is not relevant to the cost of the entire purchase.\n3. The total price of the purchase is $31, and we can deduce that the clay pot costs more than $9, and the total of all three items is greater than $31, which indicates that there is a remainder.\n4. When we look at Option B, The bag of soil, and option C, The flower, we can see that the amount of money given is for a specific flower, and they do not provide prices for a whole bag of soil or a bunch of flowers at once.\n5. So the remaining price, $31, must be $31 or more than the price for the flower.\n6. Next we will look for a way to get from one option to another, while keeping the required amount of $31.\n7. The prices for the item A, The bag of soil equals to A, which equals to $9, and the cost of Flower equals B, which equals to $22.\n8. Since B = A + C, we will plug $22 into the equation and then subtract $18 to get the price of D, The clay pot, which equals to C, which equals to $32.\n9.

{"text": "Intermediate Reasoning Stept:\n\n\n1. Begin with an analysis of the context. \"Church\" is a specific location, but there are churches around the world and thus the reference to \"church\" in the question cannot be generalized. The sentence refers to the number of church attendees, not the church building itself. Additionally, the church has 20 rows of 6 chairs each, which is a total of 20 x 6 = 120 chairs.\n2.

How many dollars did each student contribute?\nOutput: Intermedai Reasoning Step: 1. Let's write the problem in mathematical form and see what choices we can find therein. We have ten students each contributing a sum of dollars. So the question is equivalent to: There are ten students, each contributing a total of dollars, with the denominator being the total number of dollars contributed by the ten students. 2. That means we need to know the sum of dollars contributed by each student in order to find the number of students who contributed that amount. 3. So now let's try to analyze the options for some specific combinations of sums and students. Let's try each one with five students contributing $10 each. That results in a total of $105 contributed. So, the four options that result in a total of $95 or less are: A: 5 students contributing $95, each E: 6 students contributing $90, each F: 6 students contributng $85, each G 8 students contributing $75, each 4. Continuing the process, we see that choice A would result in only 4 students contributing $94 each and 1 student contributing $95. However, that doesn't make sense. With choice B, we could have either 5, 4, or 3 students contributing $92 each but this doesn't make sense either. Finally, we could have 6 students contributing a total of $87 each, as per choice C or F. However, the answer should not rely on rounding numbers, so let's exclude these choices.\n5.

{"text": "Intermediate Solutions Steps:\n\nSolution:\n\n1. This is an ordinary programming interview problem where one would calculate the total cost of the products. \n2. Since we only see Alexis buy products, we can deduce that Alexis is a female from the clothes she bought. Although we can do the calculation using male or female, \n   it's much easier to do it specifically for Alexis.\n3. We also know that the total cost is less than $200 because Alexis has at least $16 left.\n4. When we find the number of products bought and use it to multiply their cost and add it to Alexis' budget, we find it does not sum up to $200. That means\n   Alexis can only buy $200 worth of products and we can remove Alexis' total budget from the calculations.\n5. The number of products are: 1 button-up shirt (30 * 200) // $6000 1 suit pants (46 * 200 + 160) // $2160 1 suit coat (38 * 200 - 16) // $740\n6. Alexis bought 2 products in total which is the number of products in which product 1 and 2 multiply together. So the answer is 2.\n\nSolution: Step 1:\n\nThe total amount she should be able to spend is the remaining sum after she bought $200 worth products:\n\n$\\$(\\$200 - 200) = \\$0$\n\nSo, there are two possible scenarios:\n\n1.

She does have more than \\$200 and she should be able to buy anything available.\n\nSolution 2:\n\nNow we check if she can afford to buy products if she doesn't buy the first item.

Now consider the amounts that James spends on food, accommodation, entertainment, and classwork materials to narrow down the answer.\n3.

Option A: It is illogic - Illogic means irrationality and has nothing to do with weather prediction.\n3. Option B: Incorrect - Incorrect means incorrectness and has nothing to do whether or not weather predication through animal behavior is possible.\n4. Option C: Irrelevant - Irrelevant means not relevant or having no significance in the context of weather prediction, which has nothing to do with any of the given choices.\n5. Finally, let's analyze Option D: It is senseles - Sense is the faculty of perception by which we can receive or sense the external world, so this seems too abstract and incomprehensible to relate to weather prediction.\n6.

It is a very generic statement.\n2. It does not add any extra information, which makes it unnecessary.\n3. Therefore it is not the answer.\n4) Let's look at option F: there is mutual Respect and understating among the partners.\n5. One reason for this to be considered important is because partners who love each other are more likely to respect and understand each other, so this can be one reason why it's important to love your partner and one reason why partners who love each other have that mutual respect.\n6.

The first thing we notice is that they say \"she needs to...\", indicating that they are more likely than not to be referring to Valerie specifically.\n3. The question does not say how many rebates or job applications Valerie has to mail, so we can assume they have some sort of equal or unequal distribution based on the number of stamps needed to mail each.\n4. The question says that 1 stamp will be enough to mail \"everything\", meaning everything that needs a stamp has only one stamp needed to mail it, so if we assume that the rebates and job applications are similar to one another, having at least one stamp each, that means the number of stamps that are needed is equal to the total number of envelopes containing at least one stamp.\n5. The job applications and rebates she needs to mail are equal to the number of stamps she needs to mail everything.

Thus, in order to calculate the subscription price, we divide $45\\%$ by $2$ to get:\n\n$$$Discount = \\frac {45}{2}$$.\n5. As a result, the amount of the discount is $22.5\\%$.\n6. Thus, the discounted subscription price equals $33.8$, which means that the price is reduced to $33.8$.\nSo the final answer\nthe discounted subscription price\n\nInput:A box contains 12 marbles: If 2 marbles are removed from the box, there are 11 marbles left.

{"text": "Choices:  A:$12 B: $25 C: $32 D: $40 E: $49\nOutput: 1-4. Let's take a look at each choice and find where these numbers come from.\n5. Let's start with the bottle of milk. Since 75% of total cost of food ($12 + $25) = $12, it means that the bottle of milk is $12 too.\n6. Now, since the sandwich cost $4, then the juice must be $8.\n7. So the total cost is $12 + $8 + $12 = $32.\n8. That means if George buys the bottles of milk, the bottle of juice and the sandwich, and he spends $32, what he's spending on each of them is as follows:\n9. Juice $ 8 Juice $8 = Milk $32\n10. Sandwich $4 Milk $32 = Sandwich $4\n11. Milk $12 Sandwich $4 = Milk $12\n12. Sandwich $4 = Bottle of Juice $8\n13. Milk $16 = Bottle of Milk $12 + Sandwich $4 + Bottle of Juce $8\n14. Sandwich $4 + Juice $8 = Juice $16\n15. Milk $18 = Juice $8 + Sandwich $4\nStep 12 implies that the bottle of juices must be $8. Therefore, the total food cost is $18. That means that George pays $18 total for the food.\nSo the final answers is E: $49", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "1.The question asks about calculating the average cost across all items sold by Apple at their New York store on a specific date.\n2.The first part of the question explicitly includes the products sold during the given date. It states, \"Apple sold 1 iPhone for an average cost of 1000, they also sold 20 Ipads for an average cost o'900 and 100 TVs for an average o'200.\n3. The products mentioned in the first part have been listed and numbered in order of decreasing average cost.\n4. From here, we can start computing the total number of products of the types that were sold on the given date. We can do so by finding the total number of products sold with the prices provided.\n5. The total number of Apple TVs sold at Apple's New York store on a particular date is 20 X 200 = 4000.\n6. Similarly, the total number of tablets is 20 X $900 = 18000.\n7. However, note that we are not subtracting the tablets' total from the iPhones' total because the iPads were also sold on the given date along with the iPhones and the Apple TVs.\n8. The total number of phones sold is 1 X $1000 + 100 X $100 = 11000.\n9. Combining these figures, we get a total number of 20 + 80 + 4000 = 5200.\n10. Now, the average cost of the items sold can be calculated as the total number of items sold by the price of each item.\n11. In this case, the average cost is the total number of items times their average price, which is (5200 X $1733.33) / 5200 = $3,123.33.\n12. As the numbers provided in the question are correct, this formula can be simplified to (20 X $9 + 80 X $2 + 100 $1) / (20 + 8 + 1) = 30 X 14 + 2 X 200 / 11 =", "answer": " 670"}

The problem describes a situation in which a car uses 20 units of a certain kind (probably fuel) to travel x number of units of distance (probably miles) and Mr. Montero' first unit of the certain kind (fuel) can travel y number of the second units (miles). The problem then asks about solving the equation for a solution that would require x+ y units (miles) of travel.\n2. A simple solution can be found by subtracting the number of units consumed from the number of units needed by Mr. Montero to get his problem to a form with the units of the second kind being the variable: 20-8*x = x+600\n3. Since the units are units of fuel, the units of x can be assumed to be gallons. So, the number of gallons needed for the vehicle to travel 60 miles back and forth is x+(600).

Thus the total number of people would be 10.\nSecondly, we need to find which pairs of people.\n- When we only consider pairs of two people, there are 6 ways to pick two people from 10 people (i.e. 10C2).\n- When we consider all three of the pairs (i.e. the first pick is a girl, the second pick is a boy and the third pick is a girl), there are 5 ways to pick these three people (i.e 3C2 * 2C2).\n- And when we include all four pair combinations, there are only 4 ways to pick these people (i.e., 3C2 *4C1).\nTherefore, the total number of possible pair combinations that can be made of two boys or two girls or one boy and one girl or three boys or three girls are 6.\nSo the final answers are A: 6.\n\nInput: A 2x2 square consists of 4 different pieces, so when can you tell whether it is a square? Choices: 1: when its sides are right angles 2: when it can be folded into a square 3: when its edges are parallel 4: when it can be broken into rectangles 5: when its corners are connected\nOutput: 1) When its sides are right angles - A 2x2 rectangle cannot have two right angles, so it is not an instance of a square. 2) When it can be folded - This does not really apply to the specific example of a 2x2 rectangle, because it says it can be folded, not necessarily into a square. If it could be folded into a figure that is indeed a square, and that is the case, then sure it would be a square. However, since the question is specifically related to the 2x2 rectangle it cannot be used as an answer.", "answer": " 253"}

We want to determine how much profit he makes in a year, which is the total amount of profit after subtracting the total cost for the year.\n\n1. There are 12 months in a year, each month has 3 people who each pays $400 each month, for a total of 36 individual people or renters and three landlords who pay $900 per year for the space.\n2. To determine the cost for John as the landlord of the apartment, we can subtract the total income from the total spend and the formula for profit is total income is total costs + income = total costs - income.\n3. The cost for the landlord is the total income, which is 900 monthly rents times 12 which equals $10,800. Then subtracting the total income from the cost leaves a profit of $10,828.\n4. The question asks for the profit in a year, so let's solve for the amount of profit in a year to come up with the answer. The annual profit is monthly profits * 12 months, or $161.36.\n5.

A rule is that for each additional person in the elevator, the weight must decrease by 10 pounds. To get the maximum weight of 600 pounds for 9 or 11 people: 600 - 10 = 590, 590 - 10 - 10, 580 - 10 or 570 - 10.\n- We consider 590 pounds because we have weight from 4 people or less. Now it remains to wait for information about the next person. If the maximum weight of 4 people or less is 590 pounds, but there was an overload in the elevator before, then the weight of 10 more people is already 600 pounds. Therefore, the answer options are 10 people or 9 people with an overload that remained in the elevator before.

{"text": "1:  Begin by analyzing the problem statement.\n2:We are given the amount of rice Rose had, as well as the amount she cooked in the morning and the amount she cooked later in the day. We are asked to find the amount of rice that was left after cooking.\n3:Let's take an example to see the logic behind the calculation of this problem.Suppose you have 100 grams of rice, and you cook 90 grams in the morning. After that, there will be 10 grams of uncooked rice. If you cook 10 more grams, there will be 0 grams of uncook rice. However, if you cook another 40 grams, there will only be 60 grams of un-cooked rice remaining.\n4:Applying this logic to the given problem, let's see how we can determine how many grams were left.So, the overall amount of rice that was cooked for the afternoon was 1/4 of 250 grams of rice.\n5:Therefore, we must subtract 1/4 of (250 / 4) = 100 grans of rice, which leaves us 2537 1/4 grams of rice.The answer is C: 100.75\n6:This answer is correct because one cannot simply multiply 250 grans and 4 to get the total amount, as we did before. They must be multiplied by 9/10 which gives the result\n7:So, the answer is 9/10 of the amount, but the 4 must be multiplied by the 10 which will give 100.

{"text": "Intermediate Reasoning:\n\n1. There are two statements in the question, and we need to determine how to combine them in order to extract the answer.\n23. To start, let's look at the first statement from the given: Cori is 3 years old _today_.\n2. From this, it is clear that the age of Cori is in the present.\n34. We can substitute the term \"today\" with the term \"t\", which stands for time, in order to convert the age _of today _into _of t_.\n43. This is known as the notation: \"age of _t_ \".\n51. Finally, by substituting 2 years with \"t-2\" and 3 years with t-1, we form the equation: \"age of _(t-3)_\".\n6. Now, Let's look at the second statement:\n7. \"In 5 years, she _will be_ one-third the age _of her aunt.\"_\n84. Here, we know that \"one-third\" also represents _t_. But how does it relate to 5 years?\n9. This can be solved by realizing that the word 5 years is simply the phrase \"in 5 years\". Thus, we can write it as \"in 5 _(t-3)_.\n10. Now, simply replace the part of interest (i.e., t-3) with the unknown (i.e., x) to get \"x in 5 _(x)_ \".\n11. This allows us to solve the second statement as \"in 5 (x), her aunt will be _x_ years old\".\n121. We now combine these two parts by substituting _(t-3_ and _x_ for each other in order to form the final expression: \" _age of _(x)_ _+_ 2 will be her aunt's age in 5 _(t)_ _\"._\n131. Now let's solve the equation for _x_: _x_ = 3 _(t-3)+2 = 20_ years.\n143. Now we have _only_ the unknown age of her aunt, and we know her aunt's aunt is 3 times younger than (aunt", "answer": " 19"}

After getting the discount, $150, she will need 3/5 x more than $550.\n3. Since there are two possible solutions for x, this will be two equations and two unknowns.\n4. We first find the original price: x + $550 = $1050\n5. To get x, we take the original price subract the discount $150 = (x \u2013 $350).\n6. Now we use x from finding it above and rewrite the equation as 2/5 [($350 \u2013 $550) + $500] = $105.\n7. Next, we solve for x by rewriting the equation 5/2[(1/5 \u2013 2) ($350 \u2013 $1050)] + 1 = $105 and get that: 5/2[4995 \u2013 2000] = $945\n8.

Next, look for patterns or trends in the data, starting with the high point in earnings.\n2. We can see the highest amount of earning is from March to August and has two columns, so those hours were work.\n3. We can estimate the highest number of hours worked, if we average them together.\n4. We can use 13.5hrs.\n5. To calculate the dollars earned:\n6. $13.5hr x $460= 6480\n7. The value of $6480 in the given problem, so this was the correct amount of hours worked.\n8. From there, we start with 6480 and subtract the $340 in auto repairs, leaving us with 6140.\n9. From there, we divide the total of $6140 by the range of hours worked, yielding an hourly rate of $41.32\n10. We want to convert the dollars earned so that they are consistent with Sam\u2019s savings goal.\n11. $41.33 is the new amount that we should have if we use decimal, so multiply the 41.32 x 100, it equal 4132.\n12.

Here's an example of a rough estimate: Max spent 20min on bios + 20min on history + 30min on geography = 70min TOTAL.\n4. Since in each of his three subjects, he was spending two times as much time than he was spending completing the subject after biology (history), this equation can be replaced with: \"He spent TIME completing BIOS.\nTOTAL = TIME completing HIST + TIME completing GEO\". \n5. Now let's calculate how many times his time was more than it did on BIOS: \nTOTAL = [TIME completing HIST + 2 * TIME completing BIO]\nTOTAL = 2 * TIME BIO + TIME HIST \n6.

Let's begin by identifying the first mathematic operation performed on the number 36.\n\n1. 36 increased by a number 5\n\n2. The resultant was 41. (36+ 5 = 41)\n\n3. Then, 41 decreased by 4. (41 - 4 = 37)\n\n4. Then, 37 increased by another number 6.

{"text": "1. Instantly, we can count the total number of votes. If there were 7 witch and the cakes received 30 votes combined, then there were 97 votes combined. So, the total number of votes was 97.\n2. Then we need to subtract the number of votes received by the witch cake from the total number above to get the number of votes for everything else and the number of votes received for the witch cakes.\n\n3. The correct answer above is a lot more complicated, so let\u2019s go over every line slowly.\n4. This means the number of witch cakes was 3 more than the number of people voted 30 times as many as the number of votes for dragon cakes.\n\n5. The number of dragon cakes is 25, so the number of witch votes is not 325, but 25 times 3, or 75.\n\n6. The dragon cake got a total of 150 votes, as the number of votes cast is 182, which is greater than the total number, 97, less the number of votes for witch cakes. To get this number, subtract 75 (the number of votes cast for witches) from 97.\n7. Finally, the total number of people who voted is less than 7, which is 7 people plus the 97 number of votes from question one.\n8. So add 97 to 7, and round up to 104: 104 people voted for the baking competition.\nSo the final answers is 124\n\nInput:Inside the house, the thermometer reads 14C.

There are three variables in the problem: the total expense over the 18 years, the expense by type over the 18-year period, and time.\n2.  We have the information to determine the cost per year and to solve for the expense as a cost per year.\n3.  The equation is $321000.00 \u00f7 2 = $642000.0 per year (1st year).\n4. To solve for the expense by type, we can multiply the cost per year for each type of expense by the total number of years and then sum all the results :\n$64200.00 x 1 = $642,000.0 (First 8 years), $6420,00 x 2 = $1,284,000. The total spending for 8 years equals $3,212,000 (first 8 years). Spending for 10 years equals $3,876,000.\n5. By using two ratios we can solve for the total expenses by type. We can also solve the total expenses:\n$642,0 = (3212000 \u00f7 8), $1284,0 = (3876,0 \u00f7 10) This equals $321,200,000 as the total expenses by year.

{"text": "1.) We must first identify the units of the variables (edric's monthly pay, work days, and work hours), which are all stated respectively in dollars, days, and hours.\n2.) We then need to understand that there are four units of the first variable, two units of the second variable, and one unit of the third variable.\n3.) The units of the dependent variable (the answer), the third variable, are the remaining units of the original three variables (five dollars).\n4.) This means that if we multiply this number by the number of the hours worked (48), we will end up with the answer.\n5.) So, 48, the number of 8 hours worked a day for 6 working days gives the number of 480 hours worked in a month, which when multiplied by 5 dollars gives the result of 2,400 dollars for Edric\u2019s monthly salary.\n6.)

{"text": "1) Intermediate Reasoning steps:\n\n1. Look at each element individually. The question states that Yolanda is riding her bike to work at 20 mph, while her husband is catching her in his car at 40 mph.\n2. In math, subtracting two numbers indicates a decrease, and adding two numbers indicates an increase.\n3. In this context, subtracting the speed means delay, and adding the speed means quicker. In the question we're given, the situation indicates that subtracting the speed of bike (20 mph) indicates a time to slow down or a delay that will occur, whereas the addition of the speed of the bike (20mph) indicates that the situation takes longer than usual or will cause a delay.\n4. The second element in the problem is a little bit more difficult but can be explained as in this context, a 15-minute delay indicates no change or no alteration or no additional factor influencing the speed at which Yolanda is rushing to work.\n5. The third part of the problem has a similar interpretation, but we need to consider it in the context of the two previous elements:\n6. Yolanda must slow down in her bike because it takes 15 minutes and her husband is behind, at the same speed. There is something in this element that indicates a change from the norm and indicates that Yolanda will likely arrive at work late.\n7. However, since her husband is following behind her in his car at the same speed, he is making up for the delay caused by her bike ride. To determine how many minutes it takes for him to catch up to Yolanda, we need to add the times for their respective rides\n8. The total time to get to work equals 7:00 minus 40 mph minus 15m and gets canceled out by 40 mph when you subtract 15m.\n9. So, (35*60)/40 = 20 mph.\n10. That means if he takes 20 times more minutes than she does, they will both arrive at work together.\n11. 20 times 7:00 = 140\n12. So, he needs to arrive 140 minutes later than her, 2 hours", "answer": " 15"}

To calculate the number of calories that the dietitian aTE, we convert the number of calories in her lunch into a decimal fraction by dividing it by 100.\n2.) 3/4 denotes that she aTE 3/4 of her lunch. We can then substitute the fraction 3/4 for \"aTE\".\n3.) We also note that the dietitician's lunch break was three-fourths as long as her entire lunch break.\n4.) To solve for the 40/100 fraction, we must multiply it by 4 (which indicates the number of minutes her break was), and then divide by 4 (because her break was not a whole number of minutes).\n5.) We have the following equation:\n(3/4) * 4 = 50/100\n6.) Solving for the 50/125 fraction, we must multiply this fraction by 4 (indicating that the break was also a fourth of an hour), and then divide by4 (because the break was not a whole 4/125 hours).\n7.) As shown by the following equation, the answer becomes 1/8:\n(3/125) * 4 =\n8.) To figure out how many more calories the dietitian consumed than the recommended amount, we compare the number of calories she had as a whole with the number of calories the FDA recommended, as shown through the following equation:\n1/8 > 25/100 (since 1/8 > 1/25 as well, it is equivalent to 8/25)\n9.) Therefore, the dietitician consumed over 3/4 of the calories she had and over half of the recommended calorie amount.\nSo the final result is > 3/4\n\nInput: I ordered 2 dozen cupcakes for my birthday party.

{"text": "1. To solve this problem, we'll start by defining terms within the problem. We can define Governor as a person working for a state, and a commencement address as a speech typically given by a public official to graduating high school seniors.\n2. Begin by identifying the given values. The answer must be obtained by counting the total number of commencement addresses given by the three governors, including the two unspecified governors.\n3. From the problem, we know that Governor Sandoval gave twice the number of commencement address as Governor Hawkins in her first term. Since it is not specified whether Governor Sandoval's first term was the same length as Governor Hawkins's first term, we'll replace this value with a constant to avoid potential confusion. \n4. Similarly, Governor Sloan gave ten additional commencement addresses than Sandoval during her first two terms. Substituting this value with a constant, we have: 12 commencements addresses.\n5. With the given data, we need to find the total number of commensuration address given by the three governers.\n6. From the given information, we know the total number of commendation addresses that governor Sandoval gave is 26. This means she gave 12, twice as many as Governor Hawkins. This also means she gave a total of 38 commendation addresses.\n7. This makes it clear that Sandoval and the other two governors gave a total of 50 commendation addresses. \n8. So, to answer the question, we simply subtract Sandoval's two unknown commendation addresses to find the answer. That would leave a total of 48 commendation addresses given by the three Governors.\n9. Now we will substitute Sandoval's two additional unknown commendation addresses for 64 and 64+64 as a representation for her first and second term.\n10. Hence, the answer is 64+65=129.\nSo the final ansewer is E: 129", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "Intermediate:\n\n1. The key to solving this question is to understand the relationship between time and quantity, or amount. This relationship requires a mathematical operation called multiplication.\n2. By using the 12 pages/hour ratio, we can solve for the second hourly quantity by multiplying the time by the ratio: 12 x 3 = 36.\n3. In other words, if Tom's reading speed doubles from 12 pages/hr to 24 pages/hr, he would be able to read 36 pages in 2 hours.\n4. By multiplying the original 60 pages/hour by the ratio, we can determine how many pages Tom would be able to read during an entire 60 hours, or week. This is a very large number, so we can simplify the calculation by multiplying it by 6. Multiplicative division can then be used to solve for the number of pages Tom can read in 12 minutes.\n5. The answer to the question is 60 x 6 x 12 = 360. This means that Tom can read 360 pages per week, or 30 pages per day.\n6.

{"text": "1.'What would be the total amount...' indicates you are given information regarding food intake for a day, and you are asked to arrive at a total food intake for the day.\n2. As we start the analysis, if we are asked about the total food intake for a given day, the first step is to break down the question to obtain the number of dogs and the number of puppies.\n3. As given in the question, there are three dogs and four puppies, so we set the values of dogs and puppies 3 and 4 respectively.\n4. So, we start with three dogs and four pups to compute the total intake.\n5. It is given that each dog eats twice as food as compared to puppies. We calculate that 3*(x) = 4\n6. Again, as given in the question, each puppy eats 3 times as much as the dog. We calculate that 4/(4-x) = 3\n7. Based on the above, the following equation is formed:\n4 * 2 = 8 = 4 - x\n8. So 8 = 4-x, we simplify to 4 - (3/2)x\n9. Now, 4 - (3 / 2 )x = 7\n10. So, 7 = the amount of food that each dog would eat, and they constitute 3 / 3rds of the total intake. Also, the amount of food eaten by each dog is 4 pounds, so, 7 * 4 = 28\n11.

{"text": "##1. There are many ways to approach this question, which asks for the number of coffee cups brewed per week.\n##2. To start, we know that on a weekday, 10 coffee cuofts per hour are brewed. If we simply multiplied the number of hours in a week (7 days x 24 hours = 168 hours) by this number (10 hours per day per weekday), we would get 1680 coffee cups.\n##3. However, this overestimates the number of coffee cuofts brewed per week because there are more hours in the day on the weekend than there are on weekdays. In addition, the average number of hours per day throughout the entire week, including the weekend, is 120 - the total number of coffee cups over the weekend. This means that we need to factor in the number of hours per day in order to \n##4. get the average for the week. We arrive at this number by dividing the total number of hours for the week (168 hours) on 5 (the number of days in the week), which gives us approximately 33.6 hours per day. Multiplying this figure by the weekend number of coffee cups (120) and then subtracting that number from the weekday coffee cups number (1680), we get 1260 (33.6 * 120 - 1680) as the final result.\n##5.

{"text": "Intermediate Steps:\n1. Identify the key words and phrases from the question. \n2. In this question, the answer involves the length of the flagpole once it has been bent.\n3. Therefore, begin by determining how much the flagpole has been bent over. \n4. Because the problem states that the broken piece of the flagpole is dangling two feet off the ground, we would expect that its tip used to be at a 2-foot height above the ground. \n5. If we subtract this height from its original height of 12 feet, we can determine the distance that the flagpole has been bend. \n6. If the original height of the flagpole is 1.5 times greater than what it is now, then we know that the flagpole was 12 feet tall before it broke. \n7. Subtracting 2 feet from 12 feet to find the height of its tip pre-bend, we can determine that the tip's height was 10 feet. \n8. If we divide the height of the flagpole before it broke by the new height, we can determine that it has been bent over by 8.33333 percent. \n9. Therefore, if we divide 12 by 19, the new height of the flagpole, we can determine that its original height of 25/19, or roughly 60 percent of its original height, was 12 feet. \n10. If we multiply the original height of the broken flagpole by.6, we can determine that only 60 percent of the original flagpole's height remains.  \n11.

It is not about knowing how much pizza he will eat overall but about the number of pieces he will eat on a particular day.\n\n3. To analyze this question, we need to consider how many individual pizza slices he can eat on a particular day based on the two different sizes of pizza he purchased.\n\n4. The total number of slices he can eat is obtained by adding the number of slices he could possibly eat from the two large pizzas and the two small pizzas.\n\n5. Let's begin by determining how many slices he can possibly eat from the two small pizzes.\n\n6. To determine this, let's look at the slice counts for these two pizzas and understand the total slice count for both.\n\n7. 2 x 8 = 16\n\n8. The total number of pizza slices from the two small pizazzas is 16.

{"text": "1) Here, the question is asking about how many milliliters (ml) of oil are required to fix the bicycle.\n2) In order to solve this, we need to apply the principle of conservation of mass (matter and energy), which states that matter cannot be created or destroyed in a chemical reaction, therefore the amount of matter that enters a reaction must be equal to the amount that exits it. In mathematical terms, this can be represented by the equation:\n`(input)(reactants) - (output) = constant`\n3) We can apply this principle to this question by substituting each of the values stated into the equation:\n`10ml \u00d7 2 wheels + (5ml \u00f7 2 wheels) \u2260 (5ml \u00d7 2 wheheels \u00d7 1) + 5ml`\n4) This gives us the following equation:\n`(10ml \u00d7 1 \u00d7 2) + (5ml \u00d7 4) \u2260 25ml + 20ml`\n5) Solving for `x` using the distributive property, it becomes:\n`x \u2260 20 - 25`\n6) This means that `x < 0`, so it can be concluded that there is not enough oil to fix the bicycles.

{"text": "1. Let (x) denote the number of board members (people) who did attend the meeting, and (y) be the number of chairs not occupied:\n2. It is given that the total number of chairs in the conference room is given as L = 40 and that L - x = 2y.\n3. Let's try some values to see what happens. For instance, if x = 0, then we set (y) = 2(L - x), but L - x must be equal to 2, so (y) = 0. If two members did not attend, then 42 members attended instead, which makes sense intuitively even if it is not correct.\n4. If let us instead try 20 board members, (y) is still 2(L - 20), which is 2*(40 - 20) = 0 because there are no extra unoccupied chairs if there are only 20 board members. So, it doesn't make sense.\n5. If 30 board members attend, (y) is (L - 30), which means that only 10 chairs are left to be occupied. If one chair per person is occupied already and there are 10 chairs to be occupied, it means there is only one extra unoccupied chair left if there are 30 board members.\n6. If there are 50 board members, 50 chairs are filled, and only one chair is left to be occupied.\n7. The pattern above is clear, so if there are m board members, then there are m chairs left to be occupied. That is, (y) should be given by (L - m).\n\n8. Now we have what we need to start solving. We are given (L - x) = 2y, so (L - x) - 2y = 0, which is the equivalent of x - 2y = L.\n9. So x - 2y + 0 = L represents (x) - (2y) = L.\n10.

The question asks us to find out how many years there were between 1980 and 2000 based on a 10% growth rate.\n2. The answer should be based on the formula that the number of years between 2 numbers is simply the quotient of their difference.\n3. To make it easier, let\u2019s use 1985 as the base year instead of 1980.\n4. The number of years that have elapsed since 1985, or that should have elapsed since 2004, should be 14 based on the formula.\n5. This number of years must be then multiplied by 10% to get the number of years from 1985 to 2004.\n6. This multiplication yields 1.4, and 1.4 times 19 gives 28.6 years.\n7.

{"text": "1. There is a simple method for solving this question.\n2. The first step is to simplify the problem by determining how many years old Katherine will be in total.\n3. There are two ways to do this.\n4. The first way is to recognize that \"when Katherine is two dozen\", refers to a time in the future when Katherine would be 12 years old.\n5. We can then subtract 12 from 24 to get 12 subtract 12 equals 0.\n6. In this case, \"0\" indicates the years old, so the answer must be 0.\n7. The second way is to recognize that there is a pattern in which the person is three years younger than the other.\n8. From the pattern, we can also reason that there is a pattern of subtracting three years from the other person.\n9. Since Katherine is three years younger than Mel 0 years, Mel is three years older than Katherine.\n10. After subtracting three from 24 to obtain 21.\n11.

There are 7 days in a week, so John spends 1 \u00d7 7 hours lifting weights each week. This leaves us a total of 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 hours for exercising/gym.\n4. Because there are three days, we are allowed to divide the 6 hours by 3.

The answer choices ask about the number of calls Ayla can handle in a day, but the question is asking about how Ayla's phone bill can change in one month based on the number of customer complaints she deals with.\n7. Ayla can handle 50 calls per week per the question. So, the first step is computing the number of calls for a full month. There are five weeks in a month, so that's 250 complaints per month.\n8. The next piece of information is the duration or time of each caller's call, which the question specifies as an hour. That gives us a total duration for each call of 600 minutes, or 10 hours.\n9. The last piece of information needed is the cost per minute for each call, which is five cents. The cost of a single call is then rounded to the nearest penny. Therefore, each complaint is valued at $55, or 600 cents.\n10. The key question now is how do we calculate the total phone bill based on a given number of calls per month?\n11. The answer is calculated by using simple multiplication to the total number of calls at a cost of 600 c\nents each.

{"text": "1. This problem is based on a scenario where the restaurant charges a tip after tax with the consumers unaware.\n2. As a step toward solving the problem, we can evaluate the given information about the bill and the tax rate in the city.\n3. The bill totals $140 and the tax rate is 10%. This means the total tax is $14, or 10% of the total bill.\n4. To get the price of a NY Striploine, we need to multiply $80 by 0.1. Since this is tax, 0.1 is multiplied by the original price.\n$$ 0.1 \\times $80 = $8$$\n5. The problem mentions that it costs $10 for a glass of wine. This means the wine price is $10 and the tax on the wine is $1.\n$$ 0 * 10 = $1$$\n6. The tip amount comes from multiplying the price of the steak by a tip ratio, or a number between 1 and 20.\n$$ 1 \\times $8 = $8$$\n7. So, if a customer is charged $8 in gratuities, all they need to know to calculate their total bill is $140 + $14 tax + $8 gratuities = $152.\n\nInput: I work at a bicycle store and I am very familiar with the bike culture in my city.

{"text": "Solve the problem by combining information to the next level.\n\n1. Look for a sentence that starts with \"How much will it cost Martha...\" which is the key to solving this math problem.\n2. The first thing we need to do in a math problem like this is find the units.  It is best to do this by using words, because then your brain is better able to spot the units when they look more alike.  This is easier if the units look more alike.\n3. Units are the same in this problem. We are dealing with cups.\n4. To solve the math problem, find out the quantity needed for both ice creams, and the cost per unit.\n5. Quantity needed for Strawberry ice cream: 1 quart x 4 cups per quart = 4 quarts. This is the same as 4 cups, so we have 4 cups of strawberries.\n6. Quantity needed for Raspberry ice cream:  1 quest x 2 cups per quart =  2 quarts. This is also the same as 2 cups, so we need 2 cups of raspberries.\n7. Now we find the cost of one cup of each.  Since we multiplied by 4 first, let's subtract 4 from our quantities, so we have 3 cups of strawberry ice-cream, and 3 cups of raspberry ice-cream.\n8. To find the cost for one cup of each ice-cream, we find the cost of 3 cups of one ice-cream, subtract it by the cost of 1 cup of the other ice-cream, to get the cost of 1cup of the other ice- cream.\n9. The cost of 3 cuprts of the strawberry ice- cream is 3 x 3 = 9.  The cost of 1 cup is 1 x 4 = 4. Therefore, the cost of 1 qrt of strawberry ice -cream is 9 - 4 = 5.  The cost of one cup of raspberry ice -cream = 1 x 5 = 5\n10. Now sub these values: 4 cups of Strawberries = 4 x 5 = $20 2", "answer": " 20"}

Reece climbed a ladder measuring 28 feet (320 inches) 15 times, less than Keaton's.\n2) Now, let's analyze the choices:\nChoice A: 30 (Keaton's ladder)*22 (number of times Keaton climbed ladder) equals 662.\n3) Since the total number represents a unit that can be counted, it's only possible to make comparison with the rest of the choices if it is converted to the same unit for all options that represents a unit that can only be counted or estimated.\n4) We divide the sum of 660 by 320 (Reece's ladder) to convert the first choice to both the same units of 660/320 to get 2.00.\n5) Keep in mind that the 660 or 15 can be estimated as 650 or 14/2.\n6) If 650 (Keaton' feet laddder) is divided by 14/2 (Reece' ladder length) to convert choices into the same unit the result is 48.75.\n7) To check for whether all choices are same unit, 2.00 is rounded to 2, if Reece can't climb 360 inches ladders his choice should be rounded to 10, then 2/2=1.\n8) If 1/2=0.5 and 0.x and 1.x are same, the answers are equal.\n9) Let's estimate the ladders by the number of times they are climbed. 5/2=2.5 and since 2.5 <360, Choice A: 30 feet is the answer.

This does not have to be worked one for one. This could be worked in an unspecified, general range of more than 464 hours, but for argument's sake, let's pretend it is exactly 464 hours worked.\n6) This means he worked 464 extra hours to earn the $696 bonus. This is because every hour is $12.50 + $12.5 (overtime is +$1.5) = $25/hr x 464 hours = $11,740.

When a block's density decreases, that molecular structure isn't able to conduct heat.\n\tInsulators, on the other hand, refer to objects that don't allow heat to pass through their molecular structure, so they're cooler than nonconductors and heat conductors, but not as cool as heat insulators and electric insulators, which would allow heat to escape.\n\tSince being cooled by decreased density is the opposite of being heated by increased density, we're looking for the insulator.\n    The given options do not contain another category between nonconductors and electric insulator, so there aren't options B and C.\n1.

Now we can use the equation that we set in the beginning of our solution in the expression to see the total money Sally has.\n7. To see how we got here, let us consider what each amount means within the context of the overall problem.\n8. $550 is the difference between the total amount of $3,20 and the amount Sally has, which is $1,20.\n9. In this scenario, Randy has $1,20 in addition to the $3000 he started his calculation from, and Sally has $1,240. This is how our final equation was derived.\n10. Since Sally has $1200, we multiply $550 by 2 to get $1100, because Sally ends up with 2x the amount of Randy's remaining money. (Why are we doing this step? Since for each $100 that Randy gives to Sally, he keeps twice that amount of money for himself)\n\n[Randy has $1,300, Sally has $2,600, and we have $1100]\n\n11.

{"text": "We need to figure out the total number of people that rode the bus on both trips. However, the problem only provides information about the number of people riding the bus each time, rather than the total number of people carried. We can use an intermediate equation to calculate the total number of riders on both trips.\n\nLet us consider the number of people that rode each trip as A and B, respectively. We can express the total number of ridership (the sum of A and B) as such:\n\n```python\nA+B=T\n```\n\nLet us denote the total trips as T. Using the equation above, we can rearrange to obtain the following:\n\n```python \n A=T-B\n```\n\nNow, we know the number of riders on the first trip (A), the number of riders in the total number of trips (T), and the number of riders that were carried during this trip (B). Using the above equation we can calculate A as follows:\n\n```python  \n A=200-150+35\n```\n```python\nA=50\n```\n\nNow we know that A is equal to 50 and we can find out B using the following equation:\n\n```python   \nB=150\n```\n```python \nB=A-50\n```\nUsing these equations we can obtain B as follows:\n\nB=A-B=A-5(A)\n\n```python\nB = -3A +50\n```\nThe above equation represents the number of trips the bus can make using the passengers it has onboard and the above equation B = -3A + 50 which can be re-written as\n\n```python\n\nB=-3A + 45\n```\nAfter substituting the value of B as -3*A + 45 in the above equation we get\n\n```python\n-150 = -3*50 + 45\n1000 = -150\n```  \n```python    \n500=-150/-150\n```    \n```python\n500/500\n```  \n\n```python\n1=0\n```  \nWe know that the total passengers on both trips is equal to 550.", "answer": " 310"}

The first challenge is in determining the total count of animals on the boat. That means finding the total number of sheep, cows, and dogs.\n3. Fortunately for us, we have some given numbers to work with here. We're told that the boat carried 20 sheep, cows, 14 dogs, and that 3 sheep drowned, that 2 times as many cows drownted as did sheep, and that all of the dogs made it safely to shore; \n4. These details help us to count the animals on the boat, as we know that the number of sheep + the number of cows + the total number of dogs = 20.\n5. This equation reduces to 10 + n + 14 = 20, which we can solve for n (the number of cows) and get n = 11.\n6. Substituting this value into the equation 2 + 2*n (the number of sheep that drowned) = 20, and we can solve for n(the number of sheep) and get n =1.\n7. That means that the total number of sheep = 1 and the total number of cows = 11\n8. Therefore, it seems that we have arrived at our goal, but there is a missing detail which is important; we don't know how many dogs actually made it to shore, which leaves us no way to solve the main problem.\n9.

The cube of 3 is 27.\n\n5. In option 1: The submatrix is {2} where {2} represents the expression as the square of two. So, {2}**4 means {2}**4 = 8**2 or 8**(2) which is equal to 99 or 9978, whichever we choose.\n6. In option.2: The submatrix is 3, so {3}**2 + {3}**2 = 9 which is 99.\n7.In option 3: The submatrix is a value 4 which has already been eliminated in option 1. So, option 3 can't be correct.\n8.

How many people were originally aboard? Choices: 1: 39 2: 40 3: 41 4: 42 5: 43 6: 44\nOutput: Intermediate Steps:\n\nFor the question: 28 people were aboard for six month aboard a cruse ship headed to Europe. How many people were ordinarily abord? \n1. Begin by looking for an pattern in the information we have. Note that at the end of trip, there were 28 people onboard, and that at the start of the trip there was some number less than 39.\n2. Using that information, divide 39 by 28. The quotient yields 1.3928. It's not very easy to divide this number by an integer. Instead, simply multiply this number by 10 to get 13.928. Now we can easily subtract ten from this number to get that 3.928 people were abord this ship at the beginning.\n3. Since the start of the trip was six months ago, 3.92 people were abord at this point.\n4. Since the end of the trip is present, 28 people were on the ship when it docked.\n5. So the total number of people on the ship at two points in time is simply the present number plus 3.92 times the amount", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "1. Tone wants to build the longest possible rope and he has five identical lengths of rope at his disposal.\n2. To find out how long his rope is once he combines them, we will need to solve how many feet the ropes will add together, which will then allow us to deduce how long each knot will lengthen the rope.\n3. Option B, 875 feet, is too long, since the addition of two 7-foot ropes, three 2-foot ropes, five knots, and six more feet of leftover rope is not enough to yield 875 feet. So, this option cannot be correct, so let's look for an option that adds up to at least 875 feet so we can eliminate the ones that could be too small.\n4. Option A, 80 feet, subtracts 961 inches from 70 inches remaining at the start of the rope, which makes the rope 1497 inches long.\n5. Likewise, option C is too small by 1043 inches, which is the difference between 1497 + 1045 = 2542 and 80. So, both of these options are incorrect, since they don't add up to the given 875 feet even though they start from lengths of 7-foot roped.\n6. Thus, only Option D, 873,75 feet, remains as a possibility for answering the question. This option is the sum of the lengths of the ropes remaining, which are 7 feet + 7 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet, and 0.5 feet, which equals 19+18+4+4 = 46 feet. 46 feet + 2 feet of leftovers is 48 feet. Since this number is divisible by 5, we get 3+1=4 and 4 is divisible by 3, so adding 3 knots to 48 feet will make it exactly 54 feet.\n7. Furthermore, the given length to knot every foot of the rope plus 2 feet is 8 feet, which is the sum of 7 feet and 1 foot. Therefore, there are at most 8 knots, which means", "answer": " 35"}

For each of these piglets to eat the same number of straws as an adult pig, it will require: 20\u2044500 = 1\u204425\n3) If each piglet ate 1\u204425 of the straw, that means that each piglet awoke 5 straws.

So we have 2 ratios and we want to find out the total.\n6. Solve for the second quantity, which is the denominator of each of the 2 ratios. So 4 times 400/400 = 480.\n7. Solve for the the numerator of each of the ratios. So, 480/400=2/4.\n8.

In any case, choosing an amount that is less than what was available is not the right answer. \n\n2. Choice B: 25 Cents - This doesn't seem plausible because if the amount available was $1995, there would be no need to pay more interest. If there was no outstanding balance, interest would not be paid at all.\n\n3. Choice C: $ 25 - The choice here is clearly wrong.

Choices: 1) it has no width 2) it has an area greater than 10 3) it has perimeter greater than 10. 4) it's a square. E)none of the above\nOutput: 1) Since it's a rectangle, it has a width of 1 and a length of 10, which make its area equal to 10x10 = 100 but it's perimeter equal to 2x10 = 20.\n2) The product of the perimeter and the area of a rectangle is the formula PQ x AP = BA or P x A = B, so the perimeter times the area of a rectangle should always be greater than or equal to its area.\n3) Since the perimeter is P and the area of 1 by 10 rectangle is A, we can simplify P x A = B to P x A > B, or greater than or equal to B for the case of the rectangle.\n4) The rectangle defined above is not a square, because a square has equal sides and the area and perimeter are equal.\nSo the final answers are: 2) P x A = B and 4) it' is not a square.\n\nInput: This is the output from the calculator: 5.13521.

We also have the information that Ted ate 4 of the 24 cookies. Based on the given information, it is known that after eating 4 cookies, Ted leaves 20 cookies.\n4. Ted leaves on the 6th day, so the first 5 days, Frank baked 12 cookies per day to produce each tray (so that each tray makes 24 cookies). Frank ate one cookie per day, so each tray has 9 cookies left (except for the last day of the 6th day). Based on what we know from previous days, on the 6th and final day, Frank will eat one cookie less, which means that Frank will eat only 8 cookies on trays that day and there will be 7 cookies left. \n5. Because Ted ate 4 on the final day, we know that 7 cookies will be left after Ted left.\n6. The answer is therefore 7 cookies.\nSo the final answers are 7 cookies\n\nInput: A taco is 3.5 inches long.

I want the volume of this cone to be equal to 125. I will start by finding the radius. So, I measured the height and the radius. Now, I will use the equation volume = (radius)(height)(3.14). Now, I will replace 3.14 with \u03a0. To find \u03a0, I will multiply the perimeter times itself 2 more times. The perimeter of the base is 2 (radius) + Pi.

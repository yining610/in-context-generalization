{"text": "Dean ordered 2 large pizza's that were each cut into a dozen slices.  How many slices were left over after?  Dean ate a fifth of the Hawaiian pizzas,  and also ate nearly a third of the cheesy pizza.  The Hawaiian left over pieces were:  the Hawaiian = (12 - 6 = 6)  and with a fraction, 1 divided by 12 = 1/12 6 / 12 = 6/12.  That was when Dean got a slice.  Dean got a slice at a tenth, 6/12 = 1 half or 1/2.  So in one slice of pizza, 6 / 10 left over.  Total slices that were left over after that = 12 - 6/5 or 6 / 5. That = 12 - (6 / 5) =6 / 5.  So total left slices of pizza that were left were 2 minus 6/5 = 5 / 5 or we could just say 5.\n\n### Input and Response: John wanted to make a cake with his favorite ice cream on top.

At first, the farmer works on one plant, then he moves to the next. It takes 260 minutes for the farmer to finish plant 1. He then does the second plant. This takes him 420 minutes to complete, so the farmer is now finishing the third plant. Since he finished the second plant, the farmer is now back to plant 1 again. Since he finished one plant, the farmer now needs to work on a plant he has already worked on; meaning he will now work on the first plant again.  It takes 264 minutes for the farmer complete the cycle. (It is 260 minutes plus the 63 minutes he spent cutting the plants.)  This results in the total of 946 minutes, or about 1 hours and 35 minutes. To answer the question directly, it could take over two hours!\nFor anyone interested, here is the graphical explanation.

We know Iris must have brought less than Mary. If we assume that our buckets of sand are evenly distributed between the girls, we now know that Mary brought 3 more buckets than Iris. From this we can subtract Iris' from Mary's, and it leaves 4 for Mary and 3 for Eden, which total to 3 more than what Eden brought. Because there are 4 more than E's buckets, this makes it 8 total from E. Mary brought in 2 more than total brought in.

{"text": "- The frog lays 200 eggs on the 4th day.\n### Explanation:\nThe first day, it lays 50. The second day, it doubles its production, or 25, since it lays the 50 and an extra 25, for a total of 75. The third day, it \"doubles from the average\" of the previous 2 days, which is 40+25=65, so its total is 75+65=140. The 4th day, it doubles from the two previous days, so it lays 75+75+65, which is 215. Since each day doubles from the previous day, the total number of eggs would be this same amount. This is why the frog lays 140 on day 3, then 215 on day 4.\n\nInput: How did you feel the following morning?

So the boy gets a bowl and he goes to get food for the cat, he also grabs a water bowl. He goes into he's bedroom and grabs a bowl to put at the top of his room. He then looks underneath his bed because there might be a few crumbs, so he goes to get a broom. He opens the door but hears the cat meowing very quietly so he goes back so it won't wake his parents up... which he succeeds in. He opens the door and puts the bowls near the window so the cat can get the food and water. The door to the hall closes very slow, so he hurries, and goes to sleep when he finds a bed next to the window, and then starts to get bored because he doesn't know what to do.

{"text": "If a library has 7 rect. tables, 90 pupils is not enough to sit at all tables, thus to answer the question I determined how many rect. tables were needed and 90 pupils, then I divided 10 by 90 to determine how many each table would fit (10:90 = 1/10th per table). That results in 7 tables.\n\n### What did you do differently from Step One?\n\nSince I am not very good at math, I decided to go over each problem I answered from start to finish, but I noticed I made the same mistake on most of them. When I looked through the questions each time, I discovered the only question I answered incorrectly was the first one. It was not that I did not know the answer, but I did not realize I had to put the letter next to the answer.\n\n### Are you satisfied with your results and your approach? Why or why not?\nI am not sure if I should be satisfied with my results, I feel that maybe I took too long to answer each question, especially since I answered seven incorrectly. I would have been able to answer the second grade question if I had taken the time to read each one. I think the reason I made so many mistakes was because I skipped over each question without fully reading and understanding the question. I was focusing more on the picture rather than the words, that would have been a better learning experience for me to complete.\n\n### Which of your strategies did you find least useful? Why?\nAfter reading the articles we completed, the strategy I found least useful was the strategy that talks about the learning experience when completing a task. I think of myself as a perfectionist at times, not in the academic area, but in learning a new skill I am easily distracted.\n\nWhen I was learning to type, I did it on the computer in front of others, so my strategy to learn the skill would be reading the sentence, typing it correctly with each finger on the correct letter, and then having a person look over my work. This may have been the better strategy even if my fingers were moving faster because I had more control, but because I am always striving for perfection, my fingers were moving at the speed of sound while looking for the right word.\n\n### Write a response statement for this quote that is at least two complete sentences.", "answer": " 5"}

The work he gave me was a report that was half-baked and required improvements and some research to dig deeper into the topic. I then started to create the report. I felt very uncomfortable as the report was all about the data the company gathered from social media. So, I had to use some research-like techniques to create proper findings and make the data presentable accordingly. Then I added some more relevant facts about the report which the manager had not known. I tried my best to keep a balance of both knowledge and skills required to make the report impressive. The manager was not aware of the improvements I used to make the data presentable and I did manage to impress him.\n\n### Response\n\nI am amazed by the hardworking managers!\n\n### Input and Output\n\nJohn has $10,000 to split among $10 million worth of coins.

They will then come and take the money along with their services and will then pay an additional amount of 15% fee for the same.

We started the day with an assembly, and they told us about the day's curriculum. We did some work on the computers, and all the kids were happy until recess. There was a playground and a cafeteria.

{"text": "Oomyapeck eating 22 eyes\n\nIttymangnard needs to eat 19 eyes\n\nKingnook needs to eat the remaining fish\n\n### Input 2:Iittymangnark and his family, including his wife Kingnook, and their child Oomyapeck, are living in the most northern part of Alaska.  The family eats fish for their meal, sharing it equally between the mother and father of the house.  Every day, the father catches enough fish to feed everyone.  But after he catches the fish, he gives half of the fish to Oomyapeck who feeds a half of a fish to his dog.  That way, Iittymangnark always gives his wife Kingnook four fish and they receive one more totaling five of the whole fish.  This keeps happening.  How many fish does each family member receive per day?\n\n## Analysis:\n\n### Input/Output Format\n\nInstruction:The sentence asks for the total amount of fish caught.  \n\nResponse: The question states the number of fish caught, eaten, and distributed.  \n\n\n### Solution\n\n#### Solution to Example 1\n\nTo find the total amount of fish that will be eaten, subtract the fish shared between Ittymangnard and Oomyapeck from the number he catches per day.\n\nIn this case, he catches 4 fish per day.  \n\n```math\nIttymangard needs to eat 4 - (2 x 22)\n     =  65\n```\n\n#### Solution to First Example\n\nTo find the amount of fish each person is given per day, add the amount of fish caught together with the amount each is given.\n\nIn this example, the father catches 3 fish per day and gives 1 fish per day to his dog.  The father needs to eat as many fish as he gives to his dog which means he shares 2 fish with his family of 3 members.\n\n```math\nTotal fish needed to survive = 3 + (# fish to share)\n     =  5\n```\n\n### Input Analysis\n\n### Demands:\nThe instructions asks for the total amount fish caught and how many fish to distribute.

{"text": "It takes Roque two hours of walking to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and one hour of walking to work on Thursday and Friday, but two hours to go home. So the walking trip takes two hours, so it takes four on Mondays and Fridays, and three on Tuesdays Thursdays. The bike rides takes an hour, so it takes four hours. So it takes eight hours to work and four hours to go home.\n\n### Input\n\nThe company recently hired two new workers and they are in need of an area for them to work. There is only one office in the building so the workers will have to share the work space. They prefer that their offices not be divided but with the room being so small it is. So they decide to divide the office into two halves that are equal in size. They want to know how long it will take to complete the work if each worker does half of the work in the shorter amount of time. How long will it take if each worker does equally the amount of work?\n\n### Input & Solution\n\nIf they work for the same two hours then they will each do half an hour of work each. Since each worker will work two hours then half of two is an hour meaning that they each will do an hour of work. That is an hour of total work so that is when the task is completed in that one hour of combined work.\n\n### Bonus\n\n### Input and solution\n\nInput: The worker took two trips to work and came home. How many total miles to and from work did he take?\n\nFirst he woke up early in the morning and took the bus to work. Then in the afternoon he came home.\n\n#### Solution\nTo and from work took 100 miles round trip, which equals to how many miles?\n\nSo 50 (since he took twice as many miles on the way home)\n\nWe then multiply that by 2 to get 100.", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "Samantha\u2019s full name is not known and Jamie\u2019s full last name is unknown. Bobbie has only 12 letters in her last name,  Jamie has 14 letters in her last name and Samantha has 16 in her last name.  Jamie has a longer number of letters in her last name than either Samantha or Bobbie has.  Bobbie took two letters away leaving a name of 10 letters but it is unknown if this is her or Jamie's last name (Because Jamie is the first name and only has one l).  Bobbie has 12 letters and Jamie\u2019s has 14.  If Jamie had taken two letters from  either her first name or last name, she would now have a ten-letter name.  That means if it is Jamie\u2019s first name she is one away from her last name.  Because Jimi (Jamie\u2019s first name) has two letters, it is unlikely to be Bobbie's last name.  Bobbie\u2019s first name is one letter long and Jamie\u2019s last name is two more letters long and Samantha\u2019s first name and last name added together still has one letter on Bobbie\u2019s name.   There are 22 letters left to make up the two names.   So, Samantha's name is 16 and Bobbie's has 12 leaving 10 letters left.

Now that we know how many lion cubs were born per month and how many lions die per month, which is about 1, we can also draw a graph based on these two values to represent. If we draw a line starting from the origin and increasing or decreasing depending on the number of cubs born or lions die. The point corresponding to the 100 can be on the line that represents the dying lions, and the line that represents the cubs can be below the X-axis line and 1, right?\n\nNow that the point corresponding to the 99 is on the line that represents cubs, the point corresponding to 104 or even 141 is also on this line.

Using the equation of the line to calculate  and also calculate other lion points on the same line. I think there is a line that intersects with 101 or even 154, which represents the 148 points at the end of 1 year.\nThen we can just get the points that are on the line of those cubs from the origin.\n\nIn conclusion, since the number of lions at the end of 50 is 148, so the number at the end of lions is 1025.\n\n\n### Input:-15=8\nOutput:3\n\n# Python Tutorials 101", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "Answer: The bird feeder will feed 52 birds weekly. In order to solve for the number of birds the feeder can feed weekly, we break down the birdseed into how many birds can eat off 1 cup of birdseed. Every cup of bird feed will feed 14 birds. Since we have 2 cups that feed 14 birds each, we can multiple this by 2 to find out that each feeder gives 28 birds 1 week. To find out how many birds the Bird feeder feeds, we have to multiply 24 by 1. To make it more simpler, we can multiply the 24 by 7, which gives us 168 birds. To find out how often the feeder is refilled, we have to multiply the 14 by 15, which gives us 210, since the bird feeder needs to be refilled 15 times a week. 168 birds is the same as 210, because some birds can eat two cups. To make it easier, I will add 210 and 168 to make it 100 and 68. Since there are 52 weeks in a year, 68 + 100 is 168 again, meaning the feeder can feed 168 birds a week.", "answer": " 21"}

Once she purchases her hummus, she looks to find chicken. She finds chicken for $2 per pound, so she chooses 20 pounds and pays $40.  After chicken she sees bacon and decides on half a pound. She pays $5 for it and uses her last money to buy apples. As she's doing this, Joan is worried the apples cost too much, so she buys 3 of each apple.

{"text": "### Instruct: Which statement describes why a scientist looks into each of the possible effects?\n\n### Demonication:\n\nIn a well-controlled experiment there are several factors that scientists must balance to ensure accuracy of result. The factors must always stay fixed unless being altered to prove an alternative idea. Scientist can use an idea of the idea of \"null hypothesis,\" a hypothesis in which no changes occur. When a situation changes to test it, scientists must carefully note the way every aspect is involved, and they take many measurements in the process. That way, these data might reveal how one variable affects another. Often, the effect is small; or perhaps, the experiment has found another way that two variables are linked. The scientist continues testing these alternative effects because that is the beauty of science; there is much room for discovery.\n\n### Input :Why does a scientist need to use a range of subjects for a fair test? Explain how she might choose subjects that are typical for the people she is trying to experiment on.\n\n### Respone:\nEverything is different in each individual. A scientist is testing something that can potentially affect a wide range of people, so a larger test group is good. A person may not have a serious health condition or a certain symptom, and it may not be obvious why this is the case. A larger sample size is better if a scientist is testing something on a large population. When testing a drug for example, the scientist wants to ensure that the drug is affecting as wide a population group as possible. People also vary in so many ways, and what is an important factor for one person may not be for another. This is why scientists study a wide range of people\u2019s biology when testing the effects of a drug. The group of people chosen may have similar biology to the people who might use their product.\n\n### Response :What is the most important variable to keep the same in an experiment? Explain.\n\n### Answer:\nAll variables must stay constant and the same throughout a scientific experiment. There are many factors that can be used to change the results of an experiment, and scientist must take great care. Everything must be controlled and tested at the same time.

The next round of files has the total being 400, which he would then have to take a similar 70% away from. Using the 70% that he already deleted in the first round, he would then only have 280 left. After taking 3/5 of this, it leaves him with 120. This is the total number of files left after 2 rounds. We can say in terms of percentages that round 1 left him with 12 percent of the total files, but round 2 brought it down to 6 percent.\n\n\n###\n### Input:What is the last digit of 234567?\n### Demontration:  \nInput:The second digit is 5. \n\n### Response :7\n\n### Explination:The 6th number, from the end, in the 1-9 series", "answer": " 400"}

In order to respond, you have written a code of several lines. This indicates some trouble with understanding what you are asked to do and how you are asked to do it--a difficulty in processing the inputs/outputs for each question. Therefore, you should review the steps below to ensure you understand how to answer each question and the correct formats to include in your response. The instructions in these steps can all be found in the \u201cInstruction\u201d column in the question document--these instructions are provided to you as a reminder.\n\n\n1.  You must first identify the person and information given in the question in order to correctly address the request being made.\n2.  Next, you must interpret the information given by selecting answers. When answering multiple choice questions, you must interpret the request, then provide the correct answer/choice, e.g., a particular part of a book, or the name of a species.\n3.  Finally, you must determine the correct responses, i.e., a number calculation.\n4.  The request should not simply be solved in an overlong fashion. Instead, ask \u201cHow would I show the correctness of my answer?\u201d If the answer is correct, but in a long and circuitous manner, the answer should be improved.\n5.  In your final response, include all necessary code and logic that you utilized to answer the question. Your response does not simply need to provide the answer in terms of a line of code. Instead, you should demonstrate how you reached your answer.\n\n\n### Instructor Response Analysis:\n### Instruction\n\n```\n\nvar p = 1;\nif (p == 2)\n{\n   response1 = 'You found the answer.'\n   response2 = 'You did not find the answer.'\n}\n\n```", "answer": " 1200"}

{"text": "The correct answer is 16. It was the 3rd earthquake that caused the 10 buildings to collapse since two buildings already fell down in the 1st earthquake. So after the 3rd earth quake (which increased the number of collapsiblities), the count is of 16 to start with. So the 16 buildings have fallen, and the next earthquake would increase that number to 32 which means all of the buildings will have ultimately fallen down. In case, anyone wants to do it, the below math should explain how to do it:\n\nFirst 3 Earthquakes:\n4 x 4 (16 buildings) + 5 x 4 (20 buildings) + 3 x 4 (12 buildings) = 68 buildings in total.\nAfter this earthquake, the total 68 buildings fall down.\nSo the total of the next earthquake should be 68. (Not 32).\n\nBut, since the next earthquake caused 4 times the initial collapse, the total should be 264.\n\nBut again, since the next earth quake will cause 4 times the initial, the total from it should be 960.\n\nIt should not surpri sing anyone that the total from the final earth quake (960) should equal 16 x 65 building!\nThe process continues until the 65th earth quake but that is too much for this thread.\n\nIn short, the total to be calculated should not come through the multiplication by 7.

Wednesday: 2 more cars than Monday = 2 cars.  Thursday:  5 +5 +5 +2 cars pass on Happy Street = 17.  Friday: 5 +2 cars = 7.  Saturday: 7-5 = 2 cars.\n\nThis is because the first 2 months of the weekend is 10 cars, and we multiply those by the 5 days for a total of 50 cars.

{"text": "The net profit is $60.00, where she sold 15 bages and had a net proffit of $60.0 The cost price is $3.00.  The selling price is $6.00.  Thus, the profit made for each bag is $3.0, which then is multiplied by 15 to get $45.00.  That leaves $15.00 as total cost.  Then, the total net profit is $45.0 - $15.0, which equals $65.00;  divided by the total amount of bags sold, which is 15, then the amount of total net profit in each bag is $60.\n\n### InputThe sum of the ages of the father, daughter and their grandmother is 97.  The age of the daughter is  6 more than 4 times her daughter's age. The father's age is 31 years greater than the sum of their grandmother's and granddaughter's ages. How old is each member of the family?\n\n### Respons The answer is Grandmother is 62, the daugher is 18 and the father is 65.  The sum of the ages is 97, so the total age of the family, including the grandmother, is 120.  The grandmother is 68 because 62 is age of grandmother and 6 is the age of the  daughter, which is 18.  From here, you can subtract the daughter's number from 68 to get 56, which is the number the grandmother's age is based off.  This would be 68 - 12, which is 36.  Then you subtract 12 because you can not subtract 4 times the daughter's age because it is 18, which is 12 years.  You do this process with the father, but subtract 18 each time, because the father's age is supposed to be 31 years greater.

The formula can be simplified like so `length = (width)/(1 + (width/thickness))`\n\nI will use the same formula to find the length of this flowerbed.\n\nSo,\n\n`length = (4 x 1.75)`\n\nSince we know that the length is equal to double the width,\n\n`1.75 = length/2`\n\nSubtract 1 from both sides gives us:\n\n`1.45 = length/4`\n\nDivide both sides with 4 and we found that the length of the rectangle is equal to 9.38 meters.\n\nBecause the garden is 4 meters wide, its length can be easily found by multiplying 4 meters by 1.45 which will yield the result of 6.1 meters. However, 1 meter is subtracted from 6.1 giving us 6 meters, which is the amount of meters needed to fence the flower bed. The remainder is less than 0.5 meters, and this is probably a decimal. Adding up to 0.5 will give you 1.5 meters which will probably make it easy for the workers to pick up.\n\n### Hint\nYou only have to find how many meters of fence is enough for a flower garden that's at least 4 meters wide.", "answer": " 22"}

Each section will have three written questions and two short answer questions. The questions will be based on the topics that the teacher has covered in the class, in his or her teachings. You will have ten minutes to complete each section. The time will start as soon as you open your book and begin recording your answers. The questions will be read out loud by the test proctor and they have all been translated into English. The three written questions will be based on texts that you have read, but are in a different version than what you are used to. The texts have been edited to make them more accessible, easier to understand, and in a version that is easier for you to comprehend the text in the book. The two short answer questions will be based on a short video that you have seen. After you have answered the questions, you will have two minutes for rewrites. You can use this time to explain your answers, or to ask questions when the proctor reads the questions. The proctor will then have four minutes to read the answers of the previous students, and will provide you with feedback.\n\n##### Demonstration and Example\n\n##### Demostration:\n**Input**: What did the book say?\n**Output**: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.

Players alternate turns, drawing one card from the pile each turn and placing it face up on the table in front of them. A player cannot draw a card unless they have an available space on that table where they can place the card. The objective is for each player to capture 14 cards. Cards are captured when the player's opponent lays down a card whose sum equals the number of card that the player himself has played. If the player's opponents card has the same sum, then no capture happens. The game ends after the last card is drawn from the pile. A player who captures all their cards is declared the winner. If no player captures all this cards, the player captures the least number of cards is declared the winner of the game.

{"text": "Lilah's original gallery contains 400 photos\n\nOn day 1, they take half as many photos of the 400 original photos or 200 photos and on day 2 they take 120 more than that meaning the grand total is: (200*2)+120=420(=total number of  photos in gallery)\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst of all, there are two different situations going on. The grand canyon pictures were taken on the first day and their original family pictures in their gallery are from before the trip on the first day. Let's call every photo number 0 and each day's new photos will be numbered 1 and 2. The second day's pictures include what was taken on the first day plus what was taken on the second day. That means Lilah's family has pictures numbered 0, 1, 2, and the number of pictures on the second day is now a function of what day 1 included.\n\nThe first day, Lilah and her family took 400 pictures. We want to see how many it's at after they took 120 pictures more on the second day. We know after they take 121 extra pictures after the first day, the next photo will be numbered 2 and the next photo after that 3 because day 1 pictures were 0 and 1, and day 2 pictures were 1 and 2, we can say 2 is 400 + 121 = 2,300,3, and 4, therefore day 2 pictures are a function of day 1's photos.\n\nAs I mentioned, the first day, they took 400 photos and on the second day they took an additional 120, which means they end up with 320 photos on the second day total. This works because in the first day, they didn't take any more than just 400 photos, so whatever number we started with, no matter if it's day 1 or 2, no more pictures will be added to the day one total so the day one total stays the same because they took the same amount of photos each day. To find the Grand Canyon picture numbers, we just go day by day.\nDay 1 includes", "answer": " 920"}

{"text": "160\n\n### Description:For the task above, you would count the percentage of employees that drive to work and multiply that by 200.  The question is worded in reverse.  It is actually talking about the percentage of employees who do not drive to work.  It is best to reverse the question before you look at the word problem.  In the question it mentions 200 employees, 60% of the workforce drive to work, of the employees that do not drive to work half take public transportation; thus the employees that do not take public transportation is 100-50= 50%.  The fraction of employees that do not take transportation 50%/100 =1/2(1st term) 60%(2nd term)  So, 1/2 x 200 = 100, which is correct.\n\n### Input\n\n### Description\nFor the task above, it is asking how many employees do not drive to work?  \nFirst, you are asked about the percent of employees who drive to work, divide 60% by 100, and you will get.6.  So the people who drive to work is 100 *.6 and you get 60.  So now you can divide 60% (of the employees), by 60% and you get 1% to get to the actual number of employees who drive to and from work.  \nDo the same things for the question of how many don't use transportation and you get 100*(1-.6) / 2=50.  \nThe answers are wrong because they are not reversing the question.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "The first question asked whether the person was in search of an answer to a grade 7 or grade 8 mathematical query.  I answered that they were in search of grade 7 material as this is what the teacher was offering.  The second question asked as to whether the person had to look in a phone book to find a specific persons name.  They asked where I would go, I made the assumption of the teacher, and said the phone book.  The third question asked me what I thought might happen to a persons speech after becoming inebrated.  This was the question I found most confusing, and had the highest difficulty rating.  The teacher also gave me some hints saying that I may want to look at some people and study their way of talking, which I interpreted as people that are inebrated. It is my understsanding that one may speak nonsensical after becoming inebriate. The fourth question asked me about the nature of a rose bed, squirrel, and other plants and animals.  I answered these with the natural assumption that something in the nature of the rose bed is a rose, and not some other plant, or any animal.  The firth question asked me about a shark.  They asked that if the shark felt confined in its cage, where it was looking to go.

{"text": "The answer is F. 9, because the equation is: 25 - (8 - 13) = 9. You will get full credit as long as you answer the question correctly and show the calculations on the response.\n\n### Response Example:\n\nThe problem with the question is that it asks who are more than the 9. We cannot really say in this case who are more than the given 9 because we don't know if the 8 people who quit is also the people who got in and we didn't know that before they got in, we don't even know how many of the other people who quit are new people. We just have no idea. The only reason I could say who have more is based on what the question says at the end where they say that 13 people got in. So logically we can deduce that these 13 people must be the 8 people who got in. Based on that logic we can say that the team must be 13, and they are already subtracted from 25 so that means it is now 9 which is an F, that means more than.\n\n### Input\nThe man's birthday was on the 4th. What day did he wake up?\n\n### Answer\nThe correct answer is B, because the question says it is the following day, so 5th, that leaves only two options and that is 5 or 6, but the question says on the 4th when it is a day before it cannot be the 5th and therefore this question cannot be done with logic as the question does not say anything about what time he is waking up or if it is early, late or whatever, it could be the middle of the night, we do not know what the circumstances are, so this can be done only with math and I will now show the calculation.\n\n### Answer Example\nThe question states that the birthday is on the 4th, and says what next day is? This means that he must wake up on the fifth, so the following equation will be used: Birthday = 4, this also works because 4 is the first day of the week that he wakes up on that day means he must be on the 5th and that means it is the following day.

{"text": "The coffee shop brews 52 coffee cups in 1 week.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Explanation:\nIf the coffee shop opens for 5 hours a day, 5 times a day, 7 days a week and does this all year long, the total number of cups they brew in a year is 365(60 x 5). Then we just multiply that number by 12 to get the number of coffees brewed over 12 months.\n\nSo, 365(x 12) = 365 x 12 = 4380 total cups over one year.\n\nThey need to figure out how many cups they brew over 12 hours of the weekday on average.\n\nTo figure out the answer, we need to figure out the number of coffees they brew on weekdays.\n\n10 \\* 60 = 600 Coffees per one weekday, and 600 \\* 5 = 3000 Coffees for one weekday.\n\nNow, for the week, we need to multiply it with the days in the week (7 days) and then with the number of cups they typically brew on weekdays (3000).\n\nSo, 7 \\* 3000 = 21000 Coffee cups for the week!\n\nFor the whole year, we need to multiple that number by 52, to multiply by the number of days per week during the year. So we get 109500 Coffee Cups for one year.\n\nTo know that they need 60000 in the weekends, we just have to subtract the coffees brewed during the weekdays from the coffees brewed over the whole 365 days (10950 vs 13560 = 300 cups for one of the weekends!)\n\n### Bonus:Write a math equation to answer the following question.\n\n##  Challenge:What do the following abbreviation letters stand for?

{"text": "There are 26 vampires after two nights.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe answer is correct because if you plug in the numbers (two vampires in the beginning and a population of 300 people) it will give you the answer. To understand how many vampires there are after two nights, you would need to multiply the number of vampires in the community by 25, because there are two vampires, and each one turns at least 25 people into vampires in a night. 24 multiplied by 2 is 48, and 1720 multiplied by 2 would also be 34400.

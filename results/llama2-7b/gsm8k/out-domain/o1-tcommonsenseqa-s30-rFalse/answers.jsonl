While the general formula for this method is \nsimple, it can be helpful to visualize exactly how much error is introduced at each step. \nThe rule works by approximating the function at each step, then taking a weighted average of the values. In order to do this accurately, the weighted values must take into accou \nnt the fact that the error increases exponentially the further each point moves away from the original value of the function. Using this information, we can calculate how much error would be incurred at each step using various sizes of trapezoids.\nOutput: C: 1.24640092804114\nInput:In your 2d final calculus class, you should know a few methods for approximating continuous functions.

When he gets to his times table 3 he finds it is three three times 3 equal 18. Now he tries to calculate 5x3 and notices that 5x3 is just 5x5 minus 25. Because he knows 3x3 is 9, he knows that 5x5 is 25 and subtracting 25 from 25 will give him what he calculates. Now he knows that his times table 3 equals 6x6, minus 30. When he wants to calculate 6x6, he knows he multiplies it by 100. Then what does he do?\nOutput: If x = 6 then 6x6 = 36 but if x = 5 then 6x6 equals 36. He notices that every time he is multiplying his factor by 3 he is adding 30. So he divides that by 3 and finds that 5x3 = 15 or 6x3 = 18. Therefore he has solved: 6x6 - 30 = 36.", "answer": " 13"}

The first type of error is random error. This means that no matter how careful you are, there will always be variation in the measurement. The second type of error is what is called systematic error. This means that there is a bias in the measurement. The systematic error can be corrected. Here are some examples of how you can check for systematic error (the correct procedure): To measure the weight of a ball. Place a tape measure on a scale and adjust it so that it reads zero. Place the ball on the tape measure and read your weight/weight in grams. To measure the diameter of a pipe. Place a ruler on a scale and adjust so it reads zero. Place a ruler in a vise. Open the vise until the ruler touches it. Read the tape measure/pipes diameter.\nInput:One way to check for random error is to repeat the same experiment multiple times, and each time take a separate reading. This is how we can correct for random error, but keep in mind that a random error will still be within the original 95%. If it is a little too high, we need to repeat our measurement again, and again, using the procedure listed above. In science we would usually repeat our experiment at least 3 times, before we make a decision as to whether or not we believe our results. We may not always be able to repeat the experiment multiple times if we are testing very large things such as our earth, but we can see the effects of random error in everyday life. For example, we can test the random error in our scales to check if we can be assured that they are actually reading the correct weight each time. Another way to evaluate error is to see how much the total error increases each time.\nInput:1) What is the difference between systematic", "answer": " 15"}

You have decided to use the Saute function.\nSaute is activated once you have turned on the cooker and opened the steam valve.\nThe cooker uses a low steam pressure and high heat to cook. The cooker is kept at a constant pressure of around 100 kPa (7.92 lb/in\u00b2).\nThis pressure means the food cooks as quickly (as if cooked on a stove) while the steam pressure gives less variation than cooking in a pan.\nIf steam pressure was a lot higher than 100 kPA then vegetables could come to bad, too high a pressure will cook most foods unevenly, but at low pressure this is less likely.\n\n### Step 2:\n### Instruction 1:The following problem is based on a story published in the \"Daily Telegraph\" newspaper.\n\n\"A chef went to a supermarket to buy food for his cafe.

{"text": "1:5\n\nInput:In mathematics, we often find the area of rectangles. What we often overlook is the area of irregular shapes. The square meter (m^2) is a unit that measures the area of a surface where all sides are 1 square meter (1 m^2). For example, a floor area of 3 m^2, we will need a flooring covering an area of 3 square meters with the same dimensions as the flooring that the floor has. However, this problem is even more difficult with shapes like an irregularly-shaped area. Let\u2019s look at a problem of 6 irregularly-shaped pieces of flooring. The area of each flooring piece is described by the following specifications: piece 1 = 50 cm; piece 2 = 60 cm; piece 3 = 70 cm; piece 4 = 80 cm; piece 5 = 90 cm; piece 6 = 100 cm.

If a circle that passes through the center has a diameter equal to 6\u221a2 miles, what is the radius of the square?\n\nOutput: 4.398\n\nGiven that the square and the circle are congruent, how do they relate?\nThe question doesn\u2019t say it, but it\u2019s possible that the question asks you to solve for \nboth lengths, so you could reasonably choose D as the answer, because there will be a solution for \nthe length in terms of the radius where \neither the distance traveled along a ray of the circle or the distance traveled around the \nwhole circle will result in 360\u00b0 or pi radians, which is the result of multiplying the \nperimeter of the square by pi. The distance around the perimeter of the square is equal to 360\u00b0 divided \nby 4, for example.\n\nInput: If the square foot area of 16.5 by 18.0 is 536 square feet, how many square feet does 12 by 20 have?A:", "answer": " 22"}

And in the second number there are two crosses which mean the number has been divided by a factorial of one. The factorial of negative 1 is -1. Since it is an odd number, the number formed by the negative 1 is the same as the number formed by a positive one. Therefore, the factorial is 1.\n\n Input:An amount of R7 is divided into two parts in the ratio 3:2.

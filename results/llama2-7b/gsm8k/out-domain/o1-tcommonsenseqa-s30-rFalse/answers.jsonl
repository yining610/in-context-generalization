{"text": "60\n\n### Demostration:The problem states that is 60 percent longer than her previous 40% longer movie.  This indicates a new movie at 120 minutes.  A 40% increase in time means 40/100 of 120 for minutes totaling 140 minutes for the new film.  The previous film cost 1:20/minute.  This means previous the new movie cost $50 * (140 /30) for a minimum total of 500 to record it.  The new movie cost $1:12/minute, indicating it to cost more.  So $500 + 500 = $1000 is a total cost for filming.\n\n### Input, part 2:What percentage increase is the new film to the old film if the new film has a 180-minute time duration?\n\n### Answer: 25%\n\n### Demosration: \n\nThe film increased by 1.64 times greater than the last one.  This is simple division.  That 1.64 is the percentage increase.  Because 1.64 / 1.5 is 1.5 divided by 1.5.  This makes the percentage increase equal to 25%.  When the percentage increase is known, you'll know the original time or length of the original item.  So to find the percentage increase, just divide the time increase by the original time and take the percent of what is in the division.  The percent of the dividend is the % increase. In this case, that makes 180/120 or 25 % increase.\n\n### Further Reading:\nI used a math app to assist in the math used to answer the original question as given in this prompt.  \n\nThe original wording is as follows:\n**How much should you tip when the total is $38.72**\n\nSo, the tip is:\n18.72%", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "1  What I do is the temperature will decrease by 57degrees\n\n### Output:\nA temperature decrease of 57 degrees is not what you wanted? You should have changed \u201cdegrees\u201d to \u201cpoints\u201d.\n\n### Output Explanation:\nThe response is incorrect. The question asked you to find the temperature. The response contains one answer choice that meets criteria. \n\nIn one hour, Addon Mountain's temperature would decrease to 57 degrees. Since you want to make the temperature decrease by 1/4, you are correct.\n\n### Input\n\nAnswer: What I do is the mountain will decrease by 5/4 or 1/4 of its temperature. The mountain's temperature is 84 degrees which equals to 33 degrees and each minute will equal one percent or 0.01667 degrees. This means that the temperature will decrease by an increment of 0.017 degrees which equals 5/4 = 1.25 or 1 and 3/4 of a degree at each minute in one hour. In one hour the mountain will have decreased by 1 and 375/4 of a degree which is 0.269 or a little over two full degrees. This number is close but is not the actual temperature of the mountain\u2019s temperature. \n\n### Output\n\nMountain's temperature is 33 degrees and you wanted it to be 33 divided by 1/4 or 17.25 degrees. That is what you were supposed to do.\n\n### OutputExplanation\nThe response is correct. The response meets both response criteria. The response uses the information given and the given question. The response also used the correct format of the question, and it gives the correct answer.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe answer is 33 divided by one-fourth which is 17.2. This means the temperature of the mountain is going to decrease by 17.2 degrees.\n\n---\n##### [Additional Info...](https://teamtreehouse.vhx.tv/courses#!/video/grade-5-math-review-of-fractions-and-decimals)\n### Fraction Conversion Practice\nConverting to Decimals\n\n![", "answer": " 21"}

I had to think about the word in a slightly different way.\n\nIn order to get my answer for question #3, I first used `reduce` to reduce the numbers in the set to 1. Because there is no zero in the set, the sum of these numbers would be the remainder so `reduce` returns a `list` of `sum`s and the `remainder` from `reduce`.\n\nTo solve the last question, I simply subtracted the `remainder `from 44 (the sum after subtracting from the first number in the set).\n\n## :happy: I have never solved a maths problem like this before. In terms of how I would use Python, using `reduce`, `sum`, and `remainder` are very helpful in reducing problems such as these.\n\nIn terms of how to improve, I think that improving my mathematical abilities will help me to improve this code.

Have you been able to identify any other method used for calculating percentage?\n \n### If you have any questions regarding the process or other related questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. \n\n## Attachment\n1. Log - Logarithm\n\n## Description:\nLog logarithm function takes 2 parameters, the first one is an argument, and the second one is scale. The scale specifies the number of additional logarithm steps that the log function will take to obtain a higher number. The function outputs 1 minus the scale value. So, if the scale is set to 2 the output will be 2 times the argument. The formula is as below: \n$$log\\_log\\_function(a,b)=\\ln_{b}(log_{a}(x))$$  \n\n## Tests\nI tested it with:\n\n```C\nint loglog = loglog(log(x),b);\n```\n\nThe function accepts one argument only, the first one, i.e the variable \"x\" and the second, i.e the scale \"b\". The scale can have any decimal number values, but", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "Input:Tara has been working as hard as she could in order to earn $65. She wanted to become better at math then her cousin who has a great job and who is also really smart. Her cousin had offered her a deal, which was for the computer shop with 0 down, if the computer shop would give her a headache. Tara wanted something a little better. She also had to have something that she believed was important. Tara wanted to be a more enlightened and better understanding person which was what she got from the computer shop. She would gain greater understanding of headache and a headache would be the down payment that she needed to finish paying off her computer. If she didn't pay, she would get a headache like her cousin. Tara's best friend told her that if she paid an additional $20 in the beginning, then she would be able to pay for 4 months. Tara had to think about how this worked in order to fully understand it though. The computer shop didn't want to cause it's customers headache so they decided that after paying an additional $20, Tara would be able to pay off the computer in no time. Tara's final question was how much will her balance actually be once she makes her 4 month payments? After a few weeks of thinking, she was now able to tell that if she were able to pay off the 20% that she had initially paid down, then the balance on the laptop would be $1400 plus the additional $20 that she left out for herself. Tara was finally satisfied with how the deal had been made and the extra money that she had left over. Tara really wanted to make the deal with the computer shop, but she was worried. She didn't want to pay anything more then what she was told initially but she understood everything. Tara knew the headaches were real and the computer store would want to make a sale. Tara was now able to complete the trade and go on her family vacation, which she has wanted to do for a while.

We\u2019ve given you a few samples to ensure you understand the content that needs to be captured in your responses.\n\n### What is a smart form response?\n\nA natural language response is one where a computer responds to human input in a way which the human user understands. This could be for a whole range of tasks including chatbots, call centre assistance, voice-driven virtual assistants or even automated helpdesks in enterprises.\n\n### How does smart form respond to a user's input?\n\nSmart form allows organisations to answer user\u2019s questions in natural language and not be limited to the limited answers in a list of responses. In other words, it allows organisations to not use a standard form of answers which often are simply multiple choice questions or tick-boxes.\n\n### Is Smart Form able to deal with multiple-choice question types?\n\nYes - although to create such answers requires expert knowledge of the question domain. For example, if you have a form with four answer options, a machine can work out that there are not many words to choose from which can make it harder for computers to process but the more options there are (or the less restricted the answers can be), the more natural language responses a machine can provide.\n\n### Can Smart Form make decisions based on the users input?\n\nYes - this is not the answer we may be looking for when trying to answer questions but smart form has the capability to extract values directly from the question. For example, if a user asks for the latest value of the \u2018Average Temperature for Manchester, UK\u2019, you could extract that directly from the question.\n \n### How big is Smart Form?\n\nIt is written in Java so it takes up around 6MB of space but can run with that and still run efficiently.\n\n### Does Smart Form also allow organisations to create smart form responses to other forms so they can use other forms as the base for their smart forms?\n\nYes - it allows users to build responses and embed in the user interface for other forms.\n\n### Will organisations still need people to respond to smart forms?\n\nNot necessarily - a computer can respond and will not require a person to follow", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "In this question, the distance of the day that the user run should be calculated. As the distance can be written into an equation, the first step to this equation is to sum up all the distances. So, if on Monday she had a distance of 4.2 miles, on Tuesday of 3.8 miles, on Wednesday of 3.6 miles, on Thursday she ran 4.4 miles all at the end to sum up all in a variable, the user needs to first type in in a `variable`. Then the variables sum with a `+`. When it is done summing all up in a `variable` or `sum()` for example, the user can start calculating the average distance. One way to calculate the average distance is by using the `average()` function which calculates the average or mean of a set of values of a set. So, in our case, summing the distances and using average(), the average distance is calculated. Since it's an average of each distance, the only value that will come out is a number which can be displayed as a number without a units or as a decimal for the specific value that the user wants, for example `average()` `2` can be displayed `2.` or `1.5` to represent the average value as a number or number with units.

This also includes the school buses.\nIn addition, the school bus can carry 110 students at full capacity.\nSo the question is: If each class uses 20% of its monthly funds to travel the bus for 7 days a week, how much will each class have in its account at the end of the semester?\n\n#### If you have any other information, such as that the bus only carries 50% of its capacity, put it below.\n\n### Input format: \nA list of all the classes organized by grade, from 7th to 12th grade.\n\n### Output Format: A list of the monetary values of each of the classes, starting with the first class and finishing with the last class.\n\n### Sample Output:\nThe 7th grade has $551.70\nThe 7th math class has $497.20\nThe 8th grade has $39.20\nThe middle school bus leaves the building at 9:09 am to pick up students\nAt 9am a total of 12 people get on the bus: 6 in the 8th, 3 in 9th, and 3 people in the 10th grade.\nAt 9:52 am the middle school leaves 3 people on the bus, who are in the 9th grade.\n10th grade bus leaves the building to pick someone up at 14:45 hrs. At 15:45, the grade 10 bus returns home with 15 people on board.\nThe 11th grade has $110.04\nThe 12th grade has $32", "answer": " 90"}

Using the thermostat setting that is most energy efficient, the answer will be 'yes'.\"\n\n### Response3:\nAir conditioning can be very expensive to run, so you really have to do some simple calculations to make sure you don't turn on the air conditioning for too long. The heat index is a number that we can use to make sure we keep cool. To use the heat index, you have to know the humidity along with the temperature. If the humidity was 50% and the heat index for the temperature of 75 degrees was 65 degrees and it's forecasted to be 68 degrees, then would you use the AC? If the temperature and humidity are different from the heat index then you would use the AC. For example, at 100 degrees and 100% humidity, the heat index would be 60 degrees and using the formula 357/21 will get you 17.30. So to answer, \"no\"", "answer": " 135"}

However, the number of eggs that each hunter gathered could be calculated by multipying them by the number 10. One of these will result in an answer of 60. (E) It is known that Easter egg hunters, excluding Emma, are able to gather a total of 400 eggs. From the question provided, there are 6 other people and they gathered 60 eggs. Emma's total gathered in the second round is twice as many as the first round and because Tank had 20 less in the second round and 60 eggs from the 6 other people, there were only 250 eggs in the second round therefore, since the total number of eggs collected in the first round was 400, the answer is 60.\n\n### Input1: In April, Tank gathered *519*, *669*, and *922* Easter eggs in the second, third, and fourth rounds, respectively.

They are usually given as the person's height in inches, the person's height from the top of the head to the top of the shoulder. This is described by the formula `33 - h` where `h` is measured in inches.  This height is called the person's height for convenience.  It can be determined by subtracting `height` from `33`, where `height` is measured to the closest one half inch. If a person is taller or shorter than the average height and the average is subtracted from their height, this result is known as the person's relative height, and measured in inches. This can be  determined by finding their average height using their height as a starting point of their relative height.  When a person's relative height is calculated, it is found by subtracting their relative height from their height. \n\n### Demostration:\nHeight is 66\n 66 - 66 / 2 is 33.5 (relative height is negative because it's less than 33)\nRelative height subtracted from 66 is -33.5", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "Answer Choice 1\n\n### Explanation:\nIf you look at the statement, \"If a = c, then a = c\" is the conjuction.  Because conjuction has to do with two things, and this problem can be done in two parts.  The first is, \"What is $25?\"  We know the result is \"$25\" because when you double a number, it's an even number and it adds to $65, a whole number.  This is $150 because $50 + $100 = $150 because the result is the product of two numbers.  There are two ways to simplify this by adding a 10 to each side to make it a mixed number.  Once you know how $150 works, the answer would be $10, which is $20.

How will you prove that PEMDAS is correct? (Prove it with algebra and proof.)\n2. What do you think of PEMDAS? (Do you think it should be changed? Do you think it is too confusing?)\n\n### My answer:\nPEMDAS is correct as it is used on my state and it is the convention for math. I don't think PEMDAS should be changed and it also isn't too confusing.\n\n### My proof:\nTo prove that PEMD is correct I am going to perform a series of algebra and prove each part of the parenthesis. Parenthesis is important because if something isn't parenthesis then you can't perform any algebra on the number so that part is done first. If the result of parenthesis is a zero then I will multiply it by zero to make my answer. If the result is not a zero I will distribute the division to each individual problem. I will start with the division part, multiply both problems by 1/3 to get 4/3 and 1/3. Next I will distribute the multiplication of both problems to each part to get 3 x 4 and 8. To continue I will combine the two 3's to get 9, then I will combine the two multiples to get 12. Finally I combine them with the 4 to get 48.", "answer": " 36"}

Now if A, then humans go cinema. In cinema, people enjoy their time, and sometimes like to get nature. So, we can't say this is place for humans who only like to enjoy their time in the city. So, answer cannot be A but B and C are not correct.\n\nIf D, then humans go Alaska. This is nature. But even though Alaska is nature. Humans also don't go there every time. Also, we don't find humans in every city. So, E is the answer.\n\nThe answer is: E: Country.\n\n# Question 2\n\n## Solution\nGiven Input is\n```python\nwhere do human go into city to be in nature B: university \n```\n\nIf B, then humans go university to learn something. \nThey are not going for their nature. They are going for learning. There are no birds or trees there for their nature. So correct answer can't be B.\n\nIf C, humans are going park to exercise, but we don't exercise in park. It happens that we take care of our hobbies or take some nature view or just exercise by our own. So, correct answer is B.\n\nIf D E, same as previous question\n\nThe answer is B: University\n\n# Question 3\n\n## Solution\nInput is :\n```python\nThe referee called a fowl when one player punch another player.

Because they are wearing a jersey so they are sportsmen and they are playing a game so it's a sporting event.\n\nBut what player punched so the game is not \"played\" its \"suspended\". So we need to go to a sportsman event that is penalty box and answer is E.\n\nThe answer\n\n# Question", "answer": " 21"}

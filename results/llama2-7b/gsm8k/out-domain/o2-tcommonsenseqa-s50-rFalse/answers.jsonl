{"text": "Input: Mark has five types of flowers. The garden has 30 yellow flowers, 16 purple flowers, and 25 green flowers. Since there are 80 percent more purple flowers than yellow flowers, we can conclude there are 40 more purple flowers than there are yellow flowers. We would make this conclusion with the statement, \"there are 40% less yellow flowers.\" This would be true given that purple flowers make up 80% of the flowers, which means there were originally 160 purple flowers, 30 yellow flowers and 25 green floweres There are 40% of the 30=12 flowers that are yellow. Now we will count 40% of 12: 40% of twelve is 40% 12 is 5 or five.\n\nSo, there are two flowers less yellow flowers in the garden. Now, we subtract 30 from 50 for the number of green flowers and 16 from 30 for the number of purple flowers. The difference between these two is the remaining yellow flowers and the number of green flowers. This is 25 green=0 and 55 purple flowers. There are 16 more purple and 50+25=75 green flowers. 75 green + 55 purple = 130 flowers. There are 30 yellow flowers. 130 flowers - 30 yellow flowers=100 flowers.\n\n### Output: \n\nThe output of a program is the final response to what the user types, which would then either end the program or continue with next input.\n\n\n### Output for instruction above\n|Input|Output|\n|-----|------|\n|Which school won at the olympics?|University of Alabama| \n|What is 4 x 6?|24|\n|How old doe you look?|You look 50 years|", "answer": " 35"}

It does, however, equal 46\n\nThe number of invitees with an invitation from Martin's school is not known. This would explain why the sum that the question is asking us to find doesn't give the correct answer. It's possible that all the numbers given do not add up correctly.\n\nBased on the evidence, the correct answer is 43 (2-2).\n\n### Feedback:\nThe first calculation would be that 4 + 2= 6 6 x 2 12\nThe total would be one way of finding the possible answer. The second way would be to use the equation total = sum of invitations. One way would be that 5 = 1 and 2 + 5 = 7, 7 x 2 = 14, 12 + 14=26 or 26-20=6. Both of these lead us to believe that the answer is 43. Then our third calculated is what would happen after we divided one way by the other (13/15), and our ratio is three divided by four or 3/4. Then we can say that 3 is one to two and 4 is one to three, or three to four.

A group of 100 scientists were to be accommodated into 30 rooms, \neach of which 4 to 6 people can stay. Therefore, how many rooms \nmust be allocated to each scientist? \n\n### Response\uff1a\nThe answer is 6.\n\n### Reasoning and Explanation\uff1a\n4 people can stay in each room, this means that there are 25 rooms.\n\nThe question is asking you to allocate the rooms to the scientist.\n\nEach room can have 4 to 6 scientists. Therefore, we have 24 rooms.\n\nBecause that would mean 2 rooms with 1 person, and 22 room with 6 people.\n\n5 people is what each room is full up too. That is why 6 is the answer.\n\nThe reasoning is this:  If 4 rooms had 5 people in each room, then\n\nthere would be 2 rooms with only one person in each room. So the maximum\n\nof those two rooms with each person in room is 2. So in total there would\n\nbe three rooms left over not assigned to anyone (4 people in each room, so\n\n5 - 4 = 1 person left over). So that\u2019s 2 + 1. The 2 = 24 left over rooms and one\n\nperson left over times 4 is 2 people in total extra. So that\u2019s 5 people times\n\n6 people in each room which equals 30 rooms.\n\n### Input\n\n1.

{"text": "In the order of the choices, please rewrite an expression for the original question as indicated here to reflect the rewritten question.\n\nAnswer the questions and respond with the appropriate answer for that specific question.\n\n## Solution:\n***Input: Bella has two times as marbles than frisbees. How many marbles she have if she currently has a thousand?***\n\nThe marble question is A.\nThe Deck cards question is C.\nThe frisbees question is B\n\nLet B = Number of Frisbies\n\nNumber of Marbles = 2A\n\nB2A = B. There is 2A = 2B.\n\nLet F = number of marbles\n\nNow in the original question, we want the number of marbles + frisbees to be equal to 400 marbles.\n\nIn the new rewritten question, frisbees and marbles are multiplied or divided by the same number.\n\nNow the second half of the original question is the second half of the rewritten question. (Same question, so same answer).\n\nNow the first half of the original question (not the second half) is the 400 marble question.\n\nSo if the marble question is 2A, that means 400 = 2A.\n\n400 = 10A\n\nSo 10A = 400. So 10 = 40, therefore 1/40 of 10 which is 2. That's the closest answer we can assume.\n\nThe closest to 2 is 1.999999 which is just like a perfect 2!\n\nSo the closest value in this solution is 1.\n\nTherefore B x 1 = 500.\n\n200 are marbles, 300 are frisbees.\n\nAnswer: Marbles = 100, Frisbees = 200.\n\n## Tests:\n\n```\n\n```", "answer": " 140"}

First I used multiplication to multiply (5)(3) to find out that Caleb can fill his bucket 5 times and Cyntia can fill her bucket 3 times using buckets. Second, I add up 65 gallons(5(7)+ 3(8) and come out with a solution of 69 gallons. With (69/105) the answer is between 0.65 and 0.74, therefore I solved for 0.69.

If half of the 18 students are male then it follows that there are 9 boys. So in sum, 9 boys and 9 girls were able to attend the field trip.\n\nWe note that the only possible way the number of girls and number of boys have the same amount is if the number of girls who don't attend is equal to number of boys who don't attend. In our case the number of girls who didn't attend is 6. We come to this answer because 18 - 9 = 9.

It is important to note that the total number of eggs is the same as the number of people because people (children) eat eggs and eggs provide nutrition. Each person received 4 eggs.\n\n### Input A: A team of 14 is going on a trip, and will share the food equally. The leader (who will lead the trip) will take 22% of the food. The rest of the team takes exactly 16% of the food.

There will be twice as much food for the boys as the girls since the girls share the food, so they will receive 50%. Boys will still receive 25% since they don't share the food, resulting in 75% for the boys. The rest of the food, which is 28%, is left over.\n\n### Request: Solve for X.\n\n\n### Request Instruction: Write a function named find_pairs that will receive two arrays x and y and return the sum of the arrays.

{"text": "The crane is 32 feet taller on average than the building.\n\n### Explanation: The answer is `56.25`. To get the average we have to add all three proportions together.  So here are the three proportions: 228/200=1.14, 120/100=1.20 and 147,140=1.04555555. Then we can get the average by adding those three proportions together, and then we end up with `56.26`. \n\nSo in order to calculate the average, we have to add the three proportions together, get the average of the three proportions, and then reduce the decimal by 0.25 to get the answer.\n\nSo it gives us \\(1.14 + 1.2 + 1.045 = 3.405\\) for the average. Since I am looking for a number to a fraction to one decimal, I take that number and subtract 0.25 from the decimal to get 0.18555556.  \nTherefore, the answer is 3.406 or rounded to 3.40 to get 3.4.", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "One of the possible answers with explanation:\n\nWe first want to be sure what the question is asking us to do.  \nThe question is asking us to, \"use the following information to answer the question\" so we need to look at the information given to us as well as the numbers being asked for.  There might be more than one correct answer, but we are looking for the best answer with the best explanation.  We need to use the given information or information that was given initially to get to the answer the question is asking for.  Once we have the information to use we can get to the number they are asking for.  By looking at the second line first, which reads, \"It takes three truckloads...\" we should notice that what they are asking for is the number of barrels of pitch it will take to pave another 5 miles of road.\n\n16 bags, multiply it by 3 (the amount of truckloads needed to pave a mile of road), and we get how many bags there are in a truckload. That gives us 48 bags for each truckload.\n\nNow we take the number in the numerator (5 times more so we get 25) and multiply it by the number of barrel needed in a mile, which we will find out in a moment.\n\nThe bottom line (1 bag for 2 bags and pitch) gives us the number of one bag that is needed for each truckloads, which is 6.  We multiply 1 bag by 6, and then we multiply the result by the number of miles they laid (4), and we get 24 bags for a single mile.  Multiply 24 bags to 4 miles, and we get 96.  To get to the amount of barrels of it takes to pave 5 more miles we simply subtract 4 from the number to reach our answer of 92.  This is the answer we need to put down for each of the options.\n\n### Assessment:\nInput: There are two types of chocolate candy: milk chocolate and dark chocolate.

They work out for 2 minutes and they eat the rest of that time. This is because of it being a meal. So they eat for one minute and their working out for 2 and they still have however long is left between working out and eating a meal.

These codes are stored in a Java character.\n\nYou can use System.out.println to print a newline character. This method is used for printing the newline character and a carriage return. The carriage return is necessary to advance from the current line on a page. \n\nTo print newline characters, a string or a character array, use: \n\n- `System.out.println(\"\\n\")`;\n- `System.print(\"This will be outputted: \\n\");`\n\n### Demostration: 02\n\nInclude an IDE or text editor you like to use.\n\n### Answer 02\n\nI chose to use BlueJ for this response.\n\n### Programming Challenge 03  \n\n- Write two methods, an HTML and an OGG player\n- Both play the songs that were used in this lesson \n- The OGG player uses the same player that the HTML player uses\n- The HTML player should load and display an HTML page that you can navigate using the arrow buttons\n- The Ogg player should load Ogg files and play them in the browser", "answer": " 40"}

The next tree has 17.5 feet between it and the last tree he just ran to. How many feet did he walk to get to it?\n\n### Demostration\n\nWe need to work out the speed a he walked and if he took any breaks. The speed he would walk at would be the distance over the time. The distance it took to walk the number of feet is 80 so therefore his walk speed would be 10 ft/hr. We dont know how many breaks he took. We also need to calculate the speed he walked at when he ran. When he ran the time was 50 feet so his run/walk speed would be 5 miles per hour. So his final speed could be 10,5 miles per hour and our answer would be 100.5 miles per hour.\nThis makes a lot of sense because you would not want to break speed walking or run the whole way.\n\n### Reponse\n\nThis is a very interesting question because it seems like it should be so easy but so many people seem to get it wrong. This is a really tricky question.", "answer": " 52"}

We know that 2m is 2 times the recommended intake.\nWe can write a formula that  solve this equation :\nm = (4 n + 2)/5\n\nLet us define  n as our variable to represent the calorie intake.\n\nIn the formula below, which is 4n + 2)/5 \n\nThe 4n in the example is dietitian' s calorie consumption.\nThe 2 is recommended calorie intake. \n\nIt is easy to see that\nthe 4(4n + 2) equals 22(n+1) equals 2(n+1).\n\nWe can see that 22(n + 1) is the same as 2(n+ 1) which is 2(x+ 1) which we know is M. The 22 in our example is 110, which means 110 intake 2n. The -1 in", "answer": " 5"}

Car was fixed by Rusty's Auto Repair Shop. Where is the car? Choices: \na) John Street b) Smith's Street \n\n### Rationales : \nJohn's street (a) lies on the east part of the town. Smith's street (b) rests on the west part of town and it is also possible that it resides in Smith's country. The car was fixed by Rust's Auto Repair. Therefore all we can say with certainty is that the car is not in Smith's country because the Repair Shop is not there. So the answer must be John's street (a).\n\n### Input  : The car stopped by the corner of John' street, how many ways the car can stop at it? Choices : 1,2,4,6,8 ways\n\n### Rationale's : Well all we know that the car stopped by the corner and there are 2 ways in John's Street i.e. a and b. Therefore there are 2 way to stop a car in John's Street. In short there are two options of stopping car i.e. a, b.\n\n### Input ; Alice and Bob will meet at the corner of their street, the two streets are identical, except that street named for their mother, one for father, and the other for the two's grandmother. Which street would Alice come? \n\n###Rationale's : Well this question needs to look more at the way we understand the questions and the answer. All the options are 3 way. And so far we have seen only 2 options i.e. John's Street or Smith Street. So which is it?\n\n\n### The answer to this question is that there are also three options, but the question did not list them. So our answer would be that the answer is any one of the three sides of the square. (3way)", "answer": " 5"}

It was sent to the wrong name and it went to the right person. She sent it to the wrong name and Bob has it the right way.\n### Demonsttaction:\nIf Sarah did not include a copy of her note with the check and Bob only sent the note back to her, Sarah would then have the correct information and would be able to send the check to him again.\n\n### Question:\nHow does this example help you reason that Sarah did not think Bob could change a copy of the name on a check?\n\n### Rationale: In an effort to avoid sending a check to her ex-husband, Sarah sent a check to a wrong name which was addressed to Bob. Sarah assumed Bob wouldn\u2019t have enough time to send back a note in which she then used to change a copy of the check to the correct name. However, this plan failed because Bob sent a note back to her. Since Sarah\u2019s wrong assumption that Bob wouldn't have enough time to respond was not true, she should have known that he could have changed the copy of the check by sending a note which he later did. This failure to foresee that Bob could change the copy of the check indicates that she did not plan to send Bob a check.\n\n### Why is it not logically correct to say that Bob didn't send the right copy of the check because Sarah sent it to the wrong address?\n\n### Demonsstion:\nIf Bob thought Sarah sent the check to the wrong address, he would have immediately figured out it was for him. However, Bob didn't make this quick assumption because he was assuming she would have to write and send a note which indicates he did not think she would make a simple mistake of writing to a wrong person.\n\n### Rational:\nIf Bob did not think it was for him, he wouldn\u2019t have waited for note to come with the check and send", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "22\n\n### Demostration:\n1. An expression in the form of A*(B/C) is 22.\n2. Firstly, we can remove the answer choices B and C. Since Bill and Dale eat about 50% of the pizza, we can reasonably infer that if Bill or Dale eat none of their pizza, then Cate and Ann will each eat more than half their pizza, which is 75%.\n3. Since each person buys a personal pizza cut into 4 sections, we can say 4*(75%)=30. This implies that Bill and Dale together can eat 30 pieces. If they eat 50% each, then that\u2019s 50/2=25, and since there are 4 pieces per pizza, then 25/4=6.25.\n4. Similarly, we can reason that Cate and Ann can each eat 22.5, since Bill and Dale eat none, and Cate and Ann eat 75%.\n5. So, Ann and Cate will eat 2 pieces each, leaving us with 21. This multiplied by 4 pieces per pizze yields 84.\n6. So Bill and Dale eat a total of 30 pizzas. Ann and Cate each eat 22 and a half pizzas and Dale and Bill each eat 6.25 pizzas. This leaves 84 pizzas.\n7. 84 divided by 22.5 gives us 3.74, so Ann and Cate will each eat roughly 3.74 pizzas.

{"text": "Tina made $135.\n\n### Rationale: The total number of candy bars Marvin sold was 35.\n\nWe know that Tina sold 3 times the number of cars as Marvin from the prompt, so we can subtract the number of candy bar Marvin sold from Tina's.\n\nThe amount of candy bars Tina sold would only be equivalent to the amount Marvin sold if they all cost $2 and they sold the same number of candy bars.\n\nSince we know these conditions are not true, we can reasonably say that the number Tina sold is double the amount of candy Marvin sold.\n\nThe remaining number of candy bars TIna sold must be two times the number of cahdies Marvin sold.\nThus, TIna sold 5 x 35 = $175. \nThe remaining 35 is the difference between the 250 Marvin sold and Tina's 175.\nThe excess 35 represents the $70 that Marvin sold for a total of $320.  \nTina sold 175 bars for $175, so she made a profit of $70 for the class trip. Marvin sold $240 and made $320 in money for the class trip.\n\n### Input 2:A teacher is helping some students with a research paper; however, one group is falling far behind.

{"text": "21\n\n### Rationales:\n- There are 2 dogs, 2 times the number of two dogs is 4 dogs.\n- There are 3 cats, there are 4 fish so total is 8 pets. The number of pets is 2 more than double the number of more than cats plus dogs, this is then the number of cats plus dogs plus fish plus twice the number of fish again. When you multiply the 4 cats by 4 fish, it ends up as 2 fish. Once you do that, the number of fish is the sum of the number of cats and the numbers of dogs plus twice the number of the fish.\n\n- So the final answer is the sum of the cats, dogs, fish and twice the number of fish.\n\n### Input\nA: Where could a teacher be asked to use an instructional practice?

The children are going to put the balloon bouquet somewhere, so the location needs to be somewhere children can reasonably and physically expect to place a balloon bouquet.\n\n2. We can reasonably infer that the children are probably going to put the baloon bouquet in or near the yard, as this is where any children would usually place birthday gifts.\n\n3. Furthermore, we can eliminate a few choices that children are likely to place the balloon bouquets in or near.\n\n4. For example, the attic, car or pool are not typically places where children place birthday gifts, so these will be eliminated.\n\n5. The last two choices are also eliminated because the children were given balloons and not specifically asked to bring decorations, so these need not be a part of the birthday party celebration.\n\n6.

After 1 year, we can infer that the total amount of lions in London will be 148 total (bets). In order to obtain 148 cubs after the first year, we must find the number of cubs at the first month (x).\n\nx is 18 as in the first x months, there are 18 cubs born as there are 14 more months before the first year.

Because the cars are being added, it is reasonable to assume that each year there are some cars being taken away, as a 50% increase means increasing the number by double.\n\nUsing the information from the figure, Bobby will have 40 toy cars in the first year, but because the cars also get returned at the end of the year to 16 toy-cars in the next year, Bobby ends up with 16 + 16, which equals 32 in the next year. So the number continues to increase.\n\nTherefore, how many toy cars will bobby have in three years?

Which is 85-23 = 62.\n    - Then, take the whole amount of 85 and divide it by the amount of stickers Riku owns, which is (85/23) = 3.75\n2. Take 3.75 and multiply it by Riku's amount (23), which is 83.5.\n3. Add 83.5 to Riku's amount to become an entirety of stickings, which is 225.5.\n4. We will take Kristoff's amount and subtract Riku's amount from it, making it 62-225.5, which is -163.5.\n\n### Example:\n```py\nimport math\n\nnum1 = input()\nnum2 = input()\nanswer1 = (math.floor((num1-num2)*2.5)) + num2*1.5\nanswer2 = math.floor(num1*(num2/1.25))*2\nanswer3 = (answer1-answer2)/2\nanswer4 = math.floor((answer1+answer2)/3)\nprint('answer 1 = ', answer1)\nprint('answer2 = ', answer2)\nprint('answer3 = ', answer3)", "answer": " 2210"}

{"text": "Carrie needs ten square feet of wrapping paper for the three presents.\n\n### Rationale:The wrapping paper needed to cover the three presents can be calculated by multiplying the number of square feet the first present needs by 2, the number of square feet needed for the second present by 3, and the number of square feet for the third by 3. This tells us that she needs 8 square feet. Carrie needs 1 more square foot. The third present needs 2 more square feet. She needs another square foot.

First we notice that the answer doesn't fit into any of the choices, the choices are all about Parker is 4 inches shorter and then 8 inches shorter, we get the idea that they are height measures\n3. We do understand that Reese is not a measuring unit, but we do understand that we know the answer to Reese.  \n\n\nAnswer: 12 + 81 2 + 12 = 95 in \n\nThis answer is correct because 60 inch and 4 feet tall is close enough with 12 inch each and 8 feet tall is close enough as 15 inch each.

{"text": "45%\n\n### Rationale:A restaurant that forces customers to pay gratuities in addition to their bill is not only unscrupulous from a business perspective, but ethically questionable.\n\n### The restaurant's pricing strategy includes charging the customers gratuities after already including taxes in the advertised price of services/products, a practice known as \"posted pricing.\" This is a pricing strategy that allows the restaurant, despite charging higher-than-usual prices, to claim to abide by the state's restaurant laws.\n\n### One way to determine how much a gratuity is is by multiplying the tax percentage by the total price including taxes. For this example, $140 in total with $80 representing the price of the NY Striploin and $10 representing the price of a glass of wine.\n\n45% of $100 =$45\n\n45% x $80 =$36 and\n\n45%x$140 =$62\n\n62+$36= $98\n\nBut in this case this answer does not include gratuity which we are asking for. So, $83 which is 10% of $830 is added which make up the answer.\n\n### Thus, this is the final answer for gratuity is $98+$83=$181\n\n### Rather than asking the customers for extra gratuity after taxes are already included in the bill, restaurants can lower the posted price of their goods/services so that the customers incur less taxes and hence no need to charge/pay extra gratuity.\n\n### In this particular example, the restaurant can offer a 10% discount to all their customers by not charging any gratuity after tax for their $80 NY Striploin.\n\n### However, this would likely have an adverse impact on the restaurant's revenue as more people would have to continue dining there, despite the restaurant charging higher prices than necessary, in order to continue enjoying the discount.\n\n### So, in my view, restaurants should remove the pricing technique of charging gratuities after tax, as it is an unethical, unscrupulous, and", "answer": " 41"}

If we know that the number of invitations issued was 220, and that 5% will fail to show, then we know that 95% (220 * 0.95) of the guests will show up. In other words, Laura expects her wedding to be attended by the 220-95% of 95% people who attend, or 213.

Choices:  No\nA: of their behavior B: their teachers C: the principal D: the school E:'What happened to you at school today?\n\n### Rationales: The situation presented in this question is one in which kids from the neighborhood get into trouble at school. The option A, \"Of their behavior\", is the only part of the wording that may give the question away, so we can cross it off immediately.\n\n5. The terms \"their teachers\" and \"the principal\" would be people within the school. Their presence suggests that the parents' question likely has something to do with what happened at school, so we can cross of 3 options B and C.\n\n6. This can also eliminate the option D \"the school\": the school would not be a suitable candidate unless it were a special type of school with specialized staff. We can now be confident that we're dealing with the principal or a teacher as a suitable answer.\n\n7. The choice E: 'What happened to you at schoo today? would be one of the best choices that fits the context. 'What happened to you today?' would simply relate to the circumstances occurring at school rather than what the specific school staff are asking.\n\n8. So, the answer to 'Do the parents ask the kids what they don't or like?' is 'What happened to you...?'\n\n### Input:'Murderer' is an adjective how it?

{"text": "Input:Nurse Miss's task is to serve dinner to all the patients. Standard case patients receive their food in 5 min. Specialized patients receive their food in what times than the standard ones.\n\nChoices:A: 15 minutes B: 20 minutes C: 25 minutes D: 35 minutes E: 5 minutes\nRationales:There are a variety of things to think about in this question. The first is which way does time start?\n\nOption A: 15 minute. A is incorrect because it seems like it would start with time after serving the special case patients. However, as the question points out, her goal is to serve all of her patients their dinner. So if she first serves the standard case patients before the special case patients, it would start time of 5 minutes because she would need time of 20 minutes to serve the specialized patients.\n\nOption B: 20 minute. B is incorrect because it seems as though B is what it would take in terms of time to serve the special case patients because we do not know if her goal is to start with the standard case and end with the special case patients. But, as the question states, \"At dinner time, (Missy) brings each patient their meals.\" She must serve all the patients regardless of case type. So it seems we'd start out with the standard case and serve them in the 5 minute time it takes to give them their food.\n\nOption C: 25 minute. C seems to be the right answer because it says, \"At dinner time.\" If you were to start the clock when you begin your dinner service, you might time yourself like so: 5 second standard case, but 20 minute special case. That is, 20 minutes on the clock for the special case, followed by the standard case that you time at 5 minutes.\n\nIf you wanted to make these times seem more concise, you could go through the list and subtract one from the other until all the lists were equal. The last time you'd be subtracting would be 30 minutes to special case minus 30 minutes to standard case, since standard case needs only 15 more minutes on the clock than the special case. So we end up subtracting 15 minutes from your 35 minute special case. (You don't know for sure it's", "answer": " 64"}

Let\u2019s address each of these parts separately.\n\nPart 1: Calculating Number of Weeks Needed:In the first part, we are being asked to calculate the number of weeks that Oscar would need to undergo his training regimen in order to complete a 20- mile run. To do this, we first need to know how far Oscar needs to progress in his weekly training \u2013 the answer is that Oscar needs to increase the length of his run by adding 2/3 of another mile each week. This can be represented by the formula:\n\nw=2/3l+2/3l+...+(2/3)l\n\nWhere 'w' is the number of weeks since the start of Oscar's training, and \u2018l\u2019 is the length of the current week\u2019s run. Since we are looking for the number of weeks needed, our variable is the number of weeks, represented by \u2018w\u2019.\n\nSubstituting the given values for the formula, we get:\n\nw=  2/3\n(2+2/3+2/3+......+2/3)\n\nDivide the left hand side of the equation by 2/3 on both sides, to get:\n\nw=(2+2/3) \ndivide by 2/3\n\nEvaluating the fractional part of the first bracket gives us:\n\nw=(5+1/3)\n  divide by 2/3  \n= (5+1/3)/2/3\n\nSolving for divisor, this reduces to:\n\nw= (5+1)/2\n\nPlugging in 2 miles as the length represented by 'l' since the start of Oscar\u2019s training gives us the solution:\n\nw= 5/2\n  2 \ndivide by  \n  2\n\nSince 'w' is the weeks needed for Oscar to complete his training, which must be \na whole number, this solution indicates", "answer": " 27"}

The advertisement posts are 50% of his posts, it means he only has 5 hours every workday for advertisement posts, which is much less than the three hours for each post-advertising.\n\n### 4.We start by determining which part needs to be solved first. Considering the given information, we can reasonably assume that Bryan can spend more than half a day on post-marketing tasks as he is expected to spend the majority of the working day on these tasks.\n\n5.So, the first task is to calculate the amount of time he spends on advertisement posts. From the information given, we know that Bryan spends 50% of the total time working to his advertisement in an eight-hour day to determine how much time he spends on post-marketing posts and the answer is 3-4 hours.\n\n6.Then, we subtract 3-4 hours from 6 hours to find how many hours he has for post-marketing. The answer is 3 hours.\n\n### Conclusion: By looking at the steps in our response, we can see how we used a combination of reasoning and analysis to solve the task. First, we identified that the amount of time Bryant spends on post-advertising, was one of the unknown variables in the equation and calculated that it was between 3 and 4 hours. Next, we subtracted 3-4 from 6 which gave us 3 which was then converted back to hours to answer the question.\n\n## How to Use the DAGR Process\n\nWe start with the prompt and the given information, and move down the table to identify which of the options is missing.

{"text": "> At Snowflake Plastic, each employee has a total of 20 days to take off for either sick days or vacation days.\n\n### Rationales:\n1)The question says each employee has 20 days off. This means we have to find how many hours are in 20 days.\n\n2)To find how many hours are is 20 days off, we divide the 20 days into the 8 hours in a work day. That gives us 2 and 1/3 days.\n\n3)Next, we take half of that (the half of the half), so we get 1 and 2/3 days.\n4)Then, we divide that 1 and 2 /3 day into 8 hours to get the answer that we got to be 16 hours. There is nothing wrong with the answer we got, but that still doesn't answer the question so lets look at how we arrived at the correct answer.\n\n5)To answer this question, if Mark takes half of both his sick and vacation days, then we divide half of 10 (sick) by 8 (work hour in our days) and multiply the outcome by 8.\n\n6)Doing the mathematics, that gives us 12.5. So if we subtract 12.5 from 16, the remainder is 1.5. Now we have to convert this to days, so 1.5 days is 36 hours. Then, we subtract half of 10 from 16 (half sick = 8 from 16), so there is 8 hours left. When we add all that to 8 hours in a sick day, we get 36 hours in total. This also means that Mark only has 14 days to take off of any type in that year. This is the correct answer.", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "What was the daily average rain for the week? A: 2.4 B: 2.17 C: 2.19 D: 2.31 E: 2.54\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 4 math question.\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. The purpose of this question is to calculate the daily average rainfall for the week (given by the question as how much it rained per day with weekly totals in inches), as well as the total for the week.\n2. First, let's calculate the total weekly rainfall:\n    - We know that the total rainfall at the end of the week is equal to the sum of every day's rainfall during the week.\n    - This implies that the total is 2+2+2+1+1+1+2, or 12.\n3. Next, we calculate the totals for each day.\n    - We know from the question that rained 2 inches, the answer to the question \"how much did it rain?\" will be 2. Next question: Rained 1, answer is 1. Then for day 2: Rained 1 more inch, answer is 1 + 1. For day 3 it didn't rain, so answer is 0. For day 4: It rained 2 inches answer is also 2. Then for day 5 the sum of rainfall is 1 because it rained once. For day 6, answer is 1 because it didn't rain. Then for day 7 it rained 1 more inch making answer 2. Now we have all daily totals, and total for a week is already calculated.\n4. Now that we have totals for each day, it would be logical to determine the daily average of this data.\n    - First, we note that the daily average is calculated by simply dividing the total rainfall (12) by the number of days (7). This gives us a daily average of 1.72.\n5. The question now states \"What was the daily average rainfallas for the week?\"\n    - We know the formula for calculating the daily average of a group of numbers or data based on those numbers, but we must now determine the range of numbers we have", "answer": " 4"}

Given the prices, the total cost should be $10.

Choices: 1. 42 m/s 2. 30 m/s 3. 56 m/s 4. 12 m/s 5. 56 mph\n\nRationales: In this scenario, it will be assumed that 1 minute = 60 s, so: s = 35 m/s. At what speed was Sally traveling before she turned? It is obvious that Sally traveled for 35 seconds before she turned. She therefore traveled ~1,900 ft.

{"text": "There are 20 Barnyard owls making this sound.\n\n### Rationales: Given that there is five less than twenty hoots, we are assuming that one barnyard owl hoots 5 times a minute. With this assumption, it's safe to write one barnyard owls hoots. With this, we'll assume that in ten minutes there will be one owl making an average of 50 hoots or a total of 500 hoots or 50 in the first minute to give it a decent chance of not meeting 20 in the last minute of ten minutes and rounding up to two owls. Given that we know 50 that there are two owls, we can then apply an alternate approach by assuming that there are 10 owls, and in every ten minutes, there'll be one owl making 50 hoots. Given one owl makes 50 hoots in ten minutes, we will multiply 50 by 2 to round to the nearest whole.

{"text": "In order to answer the question, we will have to identify the difference between Claire\u2019s age right now and when she turned 20 years old, and identify the age of Jessica when that difference is resolved.\n\nBy subtracting the amount of time Claire was two years ago from the amount she will be in two years, we can figure out what exactly their age difference is.\n\nSince now she currently is 18 years old, subtracting the amount of years she was two years ago, which is two, results in a difference of six years.\nSo then from here, the only two numbers to get stuck on is the amount of time in years that Jessica was when Claire was two years old and the amount her age is right now.\n\nThis is so we can write the whole equation on one side, leaving us with the age of Claire and Jessica.\n\nClaire will be 22 years old in three years, but how old is she right now? This will lead us to an impossible equation of Claire + Jessica \u2013 age three years later. This gives us a difference between the two that will equal the number of years Claire had in age left to gain until she is 22 years old. This difference, in addition to Claire\u2019s age now, will become Jessica\u2019s age. 20 x 2 = 40, Claire will be six years older than Jessica. Jessica is currently six years younger than Claire. 18 \u2013 12 = 6, Claire is 20 in 2 years. Jessica is currently 12. Adding Claire\u2019s age in two years to Claire\u2019s current age results in Claire being 22 years old at the time of the question. Jessica, at the time, is 12 years old. Jessica is now 18 years old. 18 \u2013 Jessica\u2019s current age = 6, the difference between the age of Claire at this time and Jessica\u2019s current and future age can be determined. Therefore, in two years, if we subtract the age of Claire from Jessica right now, the result is 40 years. (Jessica\u2019s current age is 12 years, Claire\u2019s age is 20 years.

{"text": "500 + 200 = 700\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Jack on the phone with a \"scammer\" telling he will be arrested if he doesn't \"send them the codes from 5 $500 BestBuy gift cards and 5 $200 WalMart gift cards\". After sending the codes for one $400 gift card, Jack wise up and \"hang-up\".\n\nRational #1: \nThe question says Jack sent the codes from 1 Best Buy and 2 Walmart cards. That means Jack gave the \"scammer\" one card and only two codes. The \"scammer\" may have some way of accessing the cards. In this case, it is implied that the cards are being used in this way. So, in essence, the cards are no longer \"gift cards\", but are simply something that someone would have an access to and can be used for illegal purposes.\n\nRational #2:\nBecause there is a question of whether or not he \"sent the codes from 1...2...\" cards, it is important to use 1 \"card\" and 2 codes. One \"card\" could refer to the same 1 \"card\" the question is asked about, or it could refer to 1 of those 6 cards. 12 codes is asking about the cards that were shown to Jack and asked about to the \"scammer\".\n\nRationals #3:\nTo get the correct answer, first we need to know what the question is really asking. This question requires us to know which code set goes with each card:\n\nOne $400 \"gift card\", has 2 cards left and 2 codes left. This means that since there are 3 cards and 9 codes left. To get the answer, first consider how many sets of 9 codes there are, 9 times 2. If the question was, which $400 \"card\" was sent to the \"scammer\", the answer would be that it was the one left with only 2 codes. It is important to notice which set of cards, because if one \"card\" had 2 codes, it would not be a complete set and no single \"card\" could be used.\n\nAnswer: 575.\n\n### Input I:When someone is on the receiving end", "answer": " 3900"}

{"text": "On Friday, add 2 cups to whatever she has eaten so far. It will always be 16 cups or greater. This keeps her meeting\n the minimum daily requirement while still getting at least 7 days of eating a healthy diet.\n\n### How to answer?\n\nInput: On Friday, Sarah\u2019s vegetable consumption of the week is 16 cups (8 on Sunday + 2 cups each day on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday + 2 cups on Thursday = 16 cups).\nGuidelines recommend eating at least two cups of vegetables daily, which is a minimum of 14 cups for a seven-day week. Sarah has already eaten 8 cupers of vegetables, leaving her with the additional need of 6 cups on Friday, which can be accomplished through the provision of 2 cups on Friday.\n\n### Rationale\nSarah's goal for the week is 14 cups of vegetables. \n1. To get to this total, which is 14 cupers, one can add the total vegetables already eaten (8+8+8+8 +2 on Friday) and add any number of cups equal to half of the deficit (8 - 14).\n2. This means you can add any number of cupers equal to 8 to complete the deficit of 14 cupers.\n3. However, doing this would give you 14 cups or more, which would mean the deficit has been met and you can now go above it. \n4. So, since 14 is sufficient, we can add the minimum amount of cups (2 on a single day, Friday). \n5. This way, you can eat at least 2 cupers on that Friday and meet the minimum daily amount of vegetables required.\n6. This also ensures that by adding the recommended minimum daily amount of vegetable consumption (2 cups), you will at least meet the weekly minimum vegetable consumption.\n7. This method allows you to have a healthy diet where you eat the right amounts of vegetables everyday while ensuring that you aren't deficient.\n\n### Hide\n\nThe input for this input is: A father is showing his son how to", "answer": " 3"}

A subway system has a capacity of a maximum of 500 people and only 30 subway cars. \n\n### Response:\"On average, the capacity of the subway system is greater than the capacity of individual cars of the bus system, therefore, the subway system is more efficient.\"\n\n### Demostration:\nBus system has a capacity of maximum 150/96=1.5 buses at a time. Subway system can carry 500. This means the subway system is four times as efficient.\nA bus and a subway system would not work at equal amount of times. If a bus is being used, no subway could be used. A bus could not be used if the subway were already being used. This means the subtraction of a bus from the subway system would increase its efficiency.\n(A subway system could not take care of the whole bus system's jobs; only take over half would be able to carry 500 passengers.\n)\nTherefore, an average of time for the subways to be used is greater than average of time for the bus systems to be used.\n\n### Answer: The sub", "answer": " 310"}

The question asks about the price difference between two stores that sell the same device.\n\nII. The first store offers the device for $95 with a 6%discount.\n\nIII. The second store sells the device for \u20ac92 with a 5%discount.\n  \nIV. In order to determine the price difference, we can subtract the prices offered in each store. In other words, we will take the price of the first store, subtract the price of the second store and see the difference.\n\nV. Given the price in each store, we make $$$95-92=3$$$.\n\nVI. Therefore the price difference between the two stores is $3.\n\n#### Expand your solution using mathematical properties relevant to the given numbers.\n  \nI. Let us assume each store offers three devices for every $1,000.\n  \nII. We can simplify our problem by dividing by $1,00.\n   III. In other words, the first store offers $95 per each $1,00 units, which is a 0.95%discount. And the second store offers \u20ac92 per each \u20ac1,00 units which is a 0,5% discount.\n  \nIV We can simplify our problem to $$=\\frac{{0.95}}{{0.5}}=\\frac{4}2=2$.  \nV The amount of discount offered between these two stores is $2$.\n  \nVI Then, the profit the first store makes is $95=$2=\u20ac92-\u20ac93-\u20ac92$\n\n#### Reason for your explanation.\n\nI.

I don't know what % of apples in his garden are sour and don't know how to solve for % when you know the result. The total cost is $39.77, so this can't be right.

The answer that appears to be the most reasonable but fails to satisfy the problem is $25 apples which would generate a profit of $6.75.

From the information given, the only way for a meal to not be vegan or kosher is if it's both vegan and k*oser, or neither vegan nor kos*er.\n2. 4 people need both vegan and k*, making 4 * 2 = 8 *, which we know from the question is already accounted for in the total of 3-7=, which we can ignore as it has already been subtracted.\n3.

Option A: Zion built his triangle with height of 20 cm, however, he asked his friend to build with a height which is 2/3 * base 40 cm.\n\nHence, the friends of Zion must build with a height of 30 cm, which is different from option A.\n\n2. Option B: the friend's building with a height of 60 cm. This means that the exterior height of the prism is 1/3 * 60 = 20, but as the exterior height of a prism's base is not equal to the height of its walls' exterior, the exterior height of walls of the prism would be 10, making the exterior height of the walls of their triangles\n\n3.

But the total soft drink in this drink contained 1125 calories which meant 60% of that 2500 added sugar calories came from the soft drink. So we have to reduce the soft drink to (1125/2500)*60%. But the soft drink has 5% of added sugar, which means 60% of it is 50% since it was reduced 25/255 so 2.1 cups from each of those 750 0.1125 cups. 16.5 would come from the bars and 0.2 cups from the soft drink.\n### Input:What was so confusing about the carrots and bananas?

{"text": "50\n\n### Rationale:\nOption 1) If the bicycle has 50 spokes total it either has 48 spokes or 50 spokes on the back, which means it cannot have 50 on the back. This is a possible logic trap.\n\nOption 2) If we assume that the back wheel has 50 spkes on it and divide that with 2, we get 25 which is not a possible number of spokes on the back (it cannot be odd).\n\nOption 3) We see that the front wheel has 20 spkes but we don't see how it relates to the back wheel: if all other parts of the problem follow logic, it's most likely that the back wheel have the same number of spokes as its front counterpart. Therefore, we assume that there are 10 spokes on the rear wheel giving us a total of 60 for the bike.\n\nOption 4) We see that the back wheel has twice as many spokes as the front wheel but that in no way tells us how many wheels it has. If the back wheel has 38 spokes then the front wheel cannot have 34 spokes: that would make twice as spokes but there's only 20 - which doesn't make sense.\n\nOption 5) It is stated above that the first statement in the problem states that the bike has twice the amount of spokes on it's rear wheel but we are given no way of knowing how many rear wheels it has. We see that the problem uses the phrasing of \"on the front wheel\" several times and so it is very likely that the spokes on the back rear wheel and front rear wheel will be the same number even though the problem doesn't directly tell us.", "answer": " 60"}

And since the goal is to multiply, we multiply 42 by 250, that gives us a total of 10,500 cookies.\n\nInput: How much money did Hannah end up with?

{"text": "(If there were no male worker ants, there would be 100 female workers. The answer is 50.)\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demostration:\n\nInput: Stephen has 110 Ants in his ant farm,  100% of those Ants are worker Ants, 20% of the worker Ants are male, and there can be only 1 male per 3 worker Ants. How many Female worker Ants are there?\nRationales:\n\n1. The scenario: Stephen has 100% worker ants, Stephen has a 20% chance of a male worker, so he has a 0.2 or 20% chance at getting a male worker, and since it can only be 1 for every 3 worker ants, he will get a minimum of 1 male worker. This means he only needs 1 female worker out of every 3 Ants. Or 1 out of every 6 Ants.\n\n2. If there were no male worker Ants, there would be (110 - 1) * 100% of the worker ants female, or (110 -1)*0.8 or 99 worker Ants female.\n\n3. In the given option list, option B is the only option that allows 0.5 for every 100% female worker ants, making it 50. So the correct answer is the only option that has a female/male worker 0.50/0.33% male worker Ant. Which means, option B. Female/male worker, option B. Total worker ants, Option B. Female worker ants\n\nAnswer: B: There are 50 female worker Ants.\n\n### Input : You see 30 Ants walking south, towards an orange.

Each student must pick up 3 books from the library, and then be home by a certain time. Each person has an hour. The maximum books each student can carry at one time is 3. If they cannot get home by 7 PM, then it is too late, and the homework assignment is late.\n\n### Response::\nThrough solving the system we determine the solution is A. There is an example in a previous response. We can simplify it further by determining the minimum number of students needed to complete the homework assignment. Let c be the number of students. A=c+1, B=c+2, C=c+3. We have: A>=3, B>=4, C>=5. Clearly A>B and since A>=C then B>=C. So, A>C and only A>=3. Thus B and C must be even numbers. Further, B and C are the smallest numbers that satisfy >= and <=. B and C cannot be 1. Since the sum of A+B+C must be under 10, we can eliminate 3<4<5 because adding 3 does not result in an integer. Thus 4<=A<=7, 6<=B<=9, 8<=C<=10.

What part of the cookie did the dog eat?\" \n\n### Choices: A: The cookie B: The topping C: Nothing D: All \n\n### Rationales: When we ask a person \"What part of the cookie did I eat?\", there is presumption that the person is only referring to the actual cookie itself, and not what else, like toppings or fillings, might also be included in the cookie. The question is asking specifically about the cookie and not anything that is not the cookie itself, thus B is incorrect.\n\nOption A is incorrect because the dog has eaten the cookie, so the question is asking about the part that the dog ate. Therefore \"All\" is incorrect, as it is the total amount that the dog has eaten, not just the part that the dog chewed off or broke off from the cookie.\n\nOption C is also incorrect because the dog did not eat the whole cookie or anything else that the cookie might contain. The choice only applies to the original cookie itself, which was not taken by the dog. Therefore A is correct.\n\n### Rationale: Questions like this one are commonly asked by people on job interviews and can be difficult to answer. \n\n## Input:\"There were 3854 students in the gym at the same time.

In this case, \"calorie\" is a unit of measurement for energy. If my mom weighs a ton, then I definitely ate more than apple pie. But, if my mother is 150 lbs., then she's probably just as healthy as apple pie in terms of calories. However, if we are specifically looking at a comparison between apples and pie, we can deduce from the question that apples are healthier than pie.

Choices: A: dolls B: toy cars C: play dough D: trampoline E: sneakers\nRationales:1. The question is regarding a person's favorite toy growing up.\n2. There are a couple of important details to take into account. First, when we think or recall our favorite toys growing, we are often talking about the toy we enjoyed playing with a majority of the time. So the question is asking for the toy you played with a large chunk of your childhood on, and not the toy you may have owned briefly and not played with.\n3. Next, the context of a childhood suggests that this is a toy we held dear to us during a specific point in time in our lives. These are often toys we have fond memories of, like dolls we dressed up, an action figure we spent a large chunk of our childhood imagining their stories for, etc.\n4. After accounting for both of the above points, Option A: dolls, makes the most sense. Dolls are an item that many children like to play with and imagine stories for, and a child often plays with dolls during a large chunk of their childhood and remembers it fondly. Additionally, dolls can hold a variety of special, important moments, like dress up times, etc. Option A is therefore the most fitting choice for the context of the question.\nAnswer : A : dolls \n\n### Demo : Input: Write a response that appropriates the given instruction: How much money should I tip my waiter?", "answer": " 54"}

Over those 4 years, she is multiplying the amount of money she puts into it by 2 each year, so there must be some number multiplied by 2 from the original money she put in, leaving some of that original amount left over. \n\nGiven the change she is left with at the end is $450, she put $100 the first year.

That is, what if a scroll that is 1840 years old is given a scroll that is only 920 years old, or what if one scroll is 1610 and the next is 1230? Why do we have to keep the older one by half as many years?\n\n### Input (cont.):\nLet's make each scroll older by half the age of the previous scroll.\n\n#### Comment (cont.):\n\nThat's an excellent suggestion! Let's try it:\n\n#### Input:What is the approximate age of the fifth scroll if the first scroll is 4500 years old, the second is 4501, the third is 3051, the fourth 2500, and the fifth 1250?\n\n#### Response (Cont.):\nThe fourth scroll is 2500 years old; so the third is almost exactly 32 years older, but it is approximately 2501, the fourth is approximately 2749, the fifth is approximately 2876. The fifth scroll is 4876.\n\nTherefore, since the fourth scroll was almost exactly 32, and the fifth was 4876, the scroll is 4909 years old.\n\nNow in our second puzzle we have:\n\nFive ancient scrolls are in a cabinet. The first scroll is exactly 4500, 4501 years old, the second scroll is approximately 31,640,1099,64, the third scroll is approximately 814,345392281313,74153,50050010.

{"text": "40\n\n### Rational: 1. The first thing we need to identify is the contexts where this question might show up. \n  The most common settings where statistics and percentages are often given with a numerical context in a question format are tests and questions in school. There are other contexts in which this could happen, but they are more uncommon.\n\n2. Since question format is the most common setting to show this, the first step to solving this type of question is to understand what information we're told, where we do and do not get the information, and why in both cases. \n\n3.In this example of a math problem, we are told three statements that might not look like part of the question at first. They are \"60% of the total employees drive to work\", \"Of the employees who don' work 50% take public transportation\" and \"The total is 200 employees\".\n\n4. However, the context of the question makes it clear that these statements have been given to us. Without these statements, the question would neither have meaning nor clarity.\n\n5. The questions also make a clear cutout for what kind of answer we should expect. After we've been told the percentage of employees who don't take public transportation, we have to find out how many more people drive to work.\n\n6. Therefore, we can eliminate the answers A: 40, B: 10, C: 30, D: 60.\n\n7. We only look at the people who do not take public transportation, so the total people that drive cannot be 40, as there wouldn't be enough to reach the goal of 60 people.\n\n8. If we add a possible number who would drive and go above 60 we get a number that's unlikely and unrealistic. There are more chances for the company to find out whether or not they've exceeded the original goal of total people driving.\n\n9. Therefore, A is incorrect and we can rule out the first three options.\n\n10. This means that the number who aren't taking public transportation must be less than 40%, meaning there must be at least that many people driving, so Option E is the best match with the information given, because this is the only option that makes this possible, so", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "The woman is 20 years old.\n\n#### Justifications:\n1: We can use properties of the given set of information to determine the age of the birth child. We know the set of birthdays are 13,14,15 and 16, this means the woman was born in 1995\n\n2: The second statement says they gave birth to the second child exactly 1 year after the birth of the first, therefore, their first birth year is 1997\n\n3: The third statement says that the woman had a child in the year in which her 2nd child was 4 years old, this means the woman had a child as her birthday was in 2000\n\n4: The last item is where we begin to get the age. We know the woman just had her 20 year birthday and so she is now 4 years older than her 15th birthday, this puts her 24 years old. Knowing the woman was born in the year that her 2nd child turned 4 we also know she was born in the year 1997, thus the woman is 24 years old\n\n### Input\uff1aKelly won at the end of a contest. The contest lasted 5 days. The number of days since the beginning of the contest was divisible by 600. On the first day of the contest, Kelly started 2 minutes late. A. How many hours did Kelly take to reach the end of the contest? B. Kelly won by 17 seconds. C. How much time did Kelly save from the beginning of the contest to the end? D. How many miles did Kelly run on the last day? \n\n### Rationale\uff1a\n1. We eliminate choices C and D since they are specific questions that cannot be answered by looking only at the information provided before this question. For option A and B, since Kelly began 2 minutes late, she can be considered to be one minute ahead in total. There are 60 seconds in the minute and 5 days in a contest. 1,600 seconds in 5 days= 320 seconds each day. Each day there is 900 seconds remaining. Kelly starts 2 minutes late so she begins 320 seconds into the race each day. That means the 2 minute delay is 2 minutes", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "$1000\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Considering the initial amount of money Jake is given, the question is asking about the amount Jake has left after a specific set of events or activities.\n2. From this information, we can understand that the actions given in the question have used up Jake's entire $5000, leaving him only with $1000.\n3. Hence, his amount of money is reduced to half of the total provided in the question, which is $1000 or $500 respectively.\n4. Subsequent events are described as using up exactly half of what is already left. From this information, it is clear that whatever remained from $1000 will be reduced by half to $500 (as described by using half of what's already left), leaving Jake with $250.\n5. Similarly, the subsequent action of losing 1/4 of what is left means that Jake loses a quarter of what is already left i.e. a quarter of the remaining $250. This reduces his total money down to $165, which is then used up by buying a concert ticket.\n6. We can now conclude, with the information provided, that Jake's total money is reduced to zero and he is left with nothing.", "answer": " 825"}

{"text": "The fox can finish at a distance of 972 meter in 120 minutes.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. The fox can run at 50 kilometer per hour, so let's say that fox can run on 50km/hr pace in a 1 hour.\n2. \nWe can assume 120 minutes as 2 hours.\nSo, one can say that fox has run on the same pace continuously i.e. fox does not stop to rest during the whole process.\n3. As per the question, fox runs at the maximum speed of about 50 kilometers an hour (approximately 30 miles an hour, about 50 kilomters an hour), so it can cover 120 minutes in one speed which is about 2 hours.\n\nAnswer: 2 hours\n\n# Question:\nInput: What should an investor know when buying mutual funds?

{"text": "The subscription prices are $34 for the normal subscription and $34.25 for the promotional subscription, so the promotional subscription price is $0.75 cheaper.\n\n### Rationale: \nThe given information describes the prices of the normal and promotional subscriptions on a per-issue basis.\n\nTo understand what \"each twice-a-month\" means, the question provides us with the contextual information that the subscription is 18-months long, i.e., it's for a period of 18 issues or 18 billing cycles.\n\nWe could also apply the standard rule of arithmetic:\n\n0.25 * 18 = $4.50\n\nso each cycle would cost us $4.50, thereby effectively equating to a price of 90 cents.\n\nThus, $34 for twice-monthly issues will be equivalent to $136 every 18 issues, while $34.21 is equivalent to $140.50, \n\ntherefore, the final outcome of the question is that the promotional subscription costs $0.75 less per billing cycle.\n\n### Input 1: The best way to complete this task is to find \"two lines of code that when removed would resolve the compiler error or runtime error described above\". \nThis is where you are supposed to search for a line of code that causes the error and remove it. \n\n### Rationales 1: \nThe line of code that resolves the error is  \"public class Program { // code\" on line 2 and the entire \"class Main\"  on line 1, because class Main on line 1 is a part of the main class, so it causes it to compile. \n\n## Input 2: \nHow To Solve The Task: \nThe task is to find two lines of code from the provided file that would compile the file and resolve the error message. \nThe best way to resolve this task is to identify where the compiler error occurs, i.e., on which line, and then search for a line of similar text on either above or below, as those lines would need to be removed in order to resolve the error.\n\n### Solution: \nThe error is caused by a mismatch between", "answer": " 9"}

The question is trying to figure out the total cost of the items and how much change will be needed.\n\n2. One way to solve this problem would be to add up all the prices of the items, subtract the cost of the bills, and then add up the change.\n3.

Let's see what happens to our line Y = x (10min/km)\n\n* Let us take a look at this problem with the help of graphical modeling.\n\n  1. We are given 2 quantities in our question. i.e time (T) and the distance covered (d).\n\n2. We also know the speed (v) at which Tj covers the distance (d) of TKM.\n\n3. We are further given that TJ ran a 1400m race. i.e.\nd = 1400\n4. We know that Tj covered the first 20 minutes of this race in 20min.\n\n5. We know that the total race lasted 60min i.e the total running time was 60min.\n\n6. This way we can easily calculate the speed (v) that Tj covers (d/T). So, we get the speed as v = 60/20 = 3km/hr\n\n7. Now, lets understand how to interpret the graphical way of solving this problem.\n\n8.

The area under the curve for a distance d, for T = 20M (20min)\n\n      is equal to TJ * 20 * 3 (given speed is 3(km/hr)\n\n      therefore, the required area = 20 * 60 (since 20min of the race is 60min in total)\n\n* Hence, when we use formula to find area under curve, it is d*T*v, we get the answer as 20*60 * 3 = 600KM \u2248 60 Min *  3kmph\n\n### Input:[I am an engineer].", "answer": " 5"}

She lays enough eggs so that she doubles it in the next 110 days which comes out to be 2220. She lays 1 egg every 222 days until the last day.

In this context, any of these items could be used at any given location, such as a bathroom.\n\nHence, we can eliminate toothpaste because dental products like this would be used in multiple locations, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, by the bed.\n\nSimilarly, toothbrushes may also be used in several locations, and we can also eliminate these.\n\nElectric toothbrushes are electric, so they require use with access to an outlet, which eliminates this option.\n\nToothbrush holders may be used to hold the toothbrush and toothpaste, which is not a plausible thing a person would carry around, so we can eliminate this.\n\nFrom these, we can conclude that only F: toothbrash holder would not be used in these locations.\n\nHence the answer is F: toothbrushing holder.\nAnswer:F: toothbrashholder\n\nInput: How good looking are you?

{"text": "Michael had originally 360 matchsticks.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIn the beginning, it can be assumed that each matchstick used 2 matches. As the person says that he created 30 houses, which means there are about 2 houses per match stick.\n\nThe total amount of matchsticks that he created will be 30 houses X 2 match sticks per house = 60 matchsticks\n\nAs it is stated in the question that he used 1 match stick per house, there are three possible cases, each case having three options.\n\n1\\. Case I: If Michael used all of the match sticks he was originally supposed to use\n\nMichael was supposed to use 2 match sticks more on each house, which means he would have 2 houses per matchstick now.\n\nTherefore total matchsticks he used =30 houses X 3 match sticks per house X 1 2nd sticks in each match stick = 180 matchsticks\nAs he had originally 36 matchsticks, it was said that the person was only going to use 1 match stick per matchstick. In the beginning, he had 36 matchstick. Thus, the rest 18-180 = 142 matchsticks he had.\n\nThus 180-142 = 38 matchsticks were left. Thus the answer would be 38.\n\n2\\. Case II: If Michael used half amount of what was planned to be used.\n\nIn this case, as Michael was using one match sticks per matchstick, he would have 2 matchsticks per matchstick.\n\nTherefore, total match sticks he used = 30 houses X match stick\n\nSince he had only half amount and was supposed to use half amount, all he had were 15 houses, and that's it.\n\nTo find the amount of matchsticks he had originally, let's add one more house to the total, which will increase the number to 16.\n\nEach house has 2 matchsticks, but he has only 16 of them, which means each matchstick can be used, and so does each house.\n\nThus he had only 16 matchsticks in total, and that", "answer": " 600"}
{"text": "Tammy caught the ball 40 times\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Joe played catch with Derek. He caught the ball twenty-three times. Derek made forty-eleven less than double the catch that Joe made. Tammy caught the balls twenty-seven times. How many times did the ball got by Tammy?\n\nRationales:\n1. The key to solving the problem is to identify the pattern. \n2. Then, we need to find the unknown value. \n3. We can determine that Tammy is the one who caught the ball twenty-seven times from the information given. From the problem, there are the following unknown values:\n    * The catch that Joe made.\n    * The number of catches that Derek made. \n    * The number that Tammy did not made.\n4. There is a pattern between the number of catches that a person made and the total catches made by each person. \n5. The only way to find the pattern is to find the catch that Joe make. \n6. To do this, we have to find the unknown values that comes after the values we can find. Based on the table given:\n        1. 23 catches\n        2. 18 catches \n        3. 27 catches \n        4. 16 catches \n7.

{"text": "John should plan to use 21 liters of fuel, since 5 liters of the fuel is used for each km of a trip. We can find the solution in 2 separate ways.\n\n### Rationales:1. The question states that John uses 5 liters per km, so if you have a km trip than you would need 5 liters of gas for trip A\n\n2. John plans to take trip A that is 30km so you would need 30/5 = 6\n\n3. John plans to take another trip that is 20km, so you would need another 40/5 = 8\n\n4. There is one more thing to consider, which is to add both numbers because trip 1 will be on each end of the trip A but we are only given 6 so divide 6 by 2 and you would end up with the third option which is 3 liters so the answer is 3\n\n5. The second method is slightly different since you dont start of with fuel so you need extra\nsteps but it is the same problem on paper with the exception of a few steps\n\n1. The question states John uses 5 litres per km.\n\n2. That means if you know John is travelling 30km then John is using 30/5= 6 litres of gas for a total of 5+6=11\n\n3. Now lets calculate how many litres John will be using to travel the 20 kms.\n\n4. You use this same equation: 20/5= 4 litres for a total of 11+4= 15\n\n5. Because John is taking both trip A and trip B, you need 5+6+4 =15\n\n6. The last step is to remove the extra litres from the 5 and 6. To do this is you would need 11-6+4 =1\n\n7. So the final answer would be 5+1 = 6, so the answer is 6.\n\nAnswer: D, The answer is 6 since you'd use 5 plus 6 and 6 is already an option so your answer is 6.", "answer": " 250"}

Choices: A: food B: gas C: money D: drinks E: oxygen\nRationales:Asking if a statement applies to some specific thing is asking if that statement is true for that thing. For example, the statement would not apply to food as you could have more food, and still be hungry and need more food.\n\nOption B:gas, you can always use more gas. When you use more gas, you use less, so this statement does apply to gas.\n\nOption D, drinks, drinks are not something you use more or less of. When you drink more, you are still drinking more, and when you drink less, there is still more drink that you can drink.\n\nOption E, oxygen, you can always use less oxygen, even if you use more, you are using less oxygen. Oxygen has no maximum amount that you can use (e.g., 0.2 mol of oxygen would be one mole of oxygen, and an oxygen molecule has 0.0003333... * 0.2 = 0.007 mm of oxygen per mm, which, if rounded up, equals 0.008 mm\u00b3 of oxygen, which is less than the 0.01 mm\u00b3 of oxygen per mole that this would amount to, so the statement \"when you use more, you still use more\" does not apply).

{"text": "Tina can get back to her homework in 14 minutes. First, since the assignment required 10 minutes to finish, that means Tina has 4 minutes and 30 seconds left. Since the assignment took 10 minutes and there are 15 keys to clean, that means it takes approximately 3 minutes to clean each key. Now, since Tina cleaned one key and has 14 minutes left that means she needs to clean 14 more keys. The next step is determining the total time. The key here is to remember that if you\u2019re cleaning something, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you\u2019ll have to do that thing again. In this case, when Tina cleans a key, it just means she doesn\u2019t have to clean that key again. So 14 keys times 3 minutes equals 42 minutes. And 14 keys minus 1 key equals 13 keys. 3 minutes is 3,000 seconds. Tina started cleaning after cleaning up her first key so her time to clean started at 15 minutes and then went to 14 minutes. That\u2019s 15 and 14, which equals 29,000-3,000 which equals 26,000 seconds, which can be reduced to 42 minutes. That means Tina only has to clean 42 more minutes, which is four times her time to finish the assignment (15 minutes), which is 8 minutes (15 x 4). 8 minutes is 8 minutes, therefore, Tina has four of those which is 32 minutes (8 x 4). She still has eight minutes to go, though, after she\u2019s cleaned the 13th key, which is 320 seconds. Since she\u2019s started her time to clean the first key at 3 minutes, this is how she starts her time to clean the 14th key. 3,001 seconds is 18 minutes and 14 seconds, which is the time required to clean number 14, and it also has four minutes and 30-seconds. 15 minutes plus 18 minutes and then it\u2019s over.

{"text": "Tanika sold a total of 220 boxes over the two-day period.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe given information is:\n\n'She sold 60 boxes.' This implies she sold 60 each of the box of crackers, not all the crackers in the initial inventory. This also means that no more crackers were sold than the initial amount, so Tanika did not start selling 60 even if there were 1,000 boxes initially (1000 boxes - 60 boxes sold = 940 boxes in inventory)\n\n'On Sunday, she sold ___% more than on Saturday.' The wording of this sentence is important as it is comparing the percentage increase of how much she sold. She did not just add the crackers numbers she sold on Saturday and Sunday to get the total sold. This means she sold twice as many crackers on Sunday as she sold on Saturday (2*70 = 140)\n\nTo complete the task, we need to plug this information into the equation:\n\ntotal number of boxes sold = the number she sold on Saturday + the number she sold on Sunday\n\ntotal number of crackers sold = 60 + [2 x (total number of crackers she sold on Sunday)]\n\nTo solve the second equation, simply plug in 140 into the second equation.\n\ntotal number of cracker boxes sold = 60+140 =220\n\n### Demnstration:\n\n- Input: What was the most confusing part of learning how to use her car\u2019s gps?

So, Robi could open the water supply and let the water into the tub and then turn off the water supply.\n\nThe time Robi takes to let the water enter into the tub by opening the water supply is called `open-time` while the time Robi spends on closing water supply is called `close-time`. \n\nSo, the given problem can be solved by `open-time + close-time`. \n \n`open-time + close - time = open-time + [flap + flow rate] - time =`\n\nThe time it takes to fill the tub in terms of opening and closing the water flow. \n\nNow, consider the `open-time`, `flap + flow rate` and `close-time`. The flap is due to 1 liter of water which is escaping because the cap of the tub is not airtight. \n\n`open-time = close-time = [flap + flow Rate]`\n \nThe ratio of `flap : flow-Rate` is of 1 : 10 and Robi is able to turn off the water supply in 1 minute.

{"text": "Input: At the Delicious Delhi Restaurant, Hilary bought three Samosas at $2 each, and four orders of Pakoras at $3 each, she also purchased a Mango Lassi at $2. She left 25% tip (T) = 0.25. How much did the menu cost?\nChoices:A.$112.B.$160.C.$192.D.$324E.$144.F.$80\nRationale for answerA. $112. First, we will calculate how much Hilary spent on the meal including tax. Hilary spent $36+ ($4(4)) + $6 = $44 + $16 = $60, plus the tip $60+ T = $60+ 0.25($60) = $60+0.15 = $60+8 = $68, so the total amount spent on the meal was $112.\nRationale for answer B.$160. Second, we will calculate how Hilary spent her money without including tax.\nHilary spent $36+$32= $68 on the meal plus $16 extra for the tip.\nSince Hilary paid with $74 then, $68 (for the meal) = $68+$32 = $100 = $74+$26 = $100 (total cost), so the cost of the meal without tax is  $100. Including tax in the amount, $112 = $108+$ 12 = $18+$25 = $0+$25=. $25+$25 = $75. In the final step, since the cost of the meals is $112 (including tax), we can calculate that $112 = 108+$12 = 2.25.\nFor the answer, F = 2.26+3.28 (because (2.25+108/12) =3.28) = 3.28 = 5+$0.25 =$32.8.\nNote: If it were in the wrong order, then you were mistaken and should recheck.\nRationale", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": "Answer Choices:\n  * The correct answer choice is B because the expression \"three times as many\" means that Angie bought three times as much pretzels as Shelly bought pretzels; which, in turn, means that Shelly bought half the amount of pretzels that Angie bought. Subtracting half of pretzels from pretzels, means Barry's choice of 12 pretzells is three times as many pretzel as Shelly originally bought.

We will try to figure out the rectangle by using information of its outer layer\n\n1. Option A is incorrect because if the answer was A, it would mean that 1 of the sides of the rectangle was equal to 10m, which means this would result in an area of 1, which doesnt make sense.\n2. Option B is incorrect because if this was the correct answer, then the area of the rectangle would be 50, and the perimeter would be 20, which means the length would be 10\n3. Option C is incorrect because this equation seems like it makes sense but if we solve it the equation looks like:\n\n(4W)(4W)\n\nwhich is 16W, the perimeter of length is 10, so\n\n(16W)(10)\n\nwhich comes to over 8000 m2\n\nIf we were to solve the equation to find W in terms of L\n\n(4W/L)(4W/L)=16/10\n\nand then simplify\n\n4W/L=4\n\nwhich would mean our equation would be 4W/10, where we know the area is 16, and the perimeter is 10, and we know the area of 4 and we know the perimeter of 10, then this would mean our W would be 5\n\nOption I is correct, because if we were to solve\n\n(10)(10)=100 and that means the length that was given to us must have been 5m\n\nAnswer: I:5\n\n### Input : The length of the rectangle is 10 m.

{"text": "Susan would spend $8.50 if she purchases each batch of food that calls for 2 servings. A batch of food requires 4 potatoes, 1 teaspoons of salt, and has a cost of $0.10 (4*2*10+10). Since each batch of food uses 4 potatoes, each potato costs $0.25 (10*4). Each batch costs a total of $1.32 (4*2*0.25+10). The recipe calls for 2 servicing per batch of food, which is $0.66 (2*1.32). To make 30 serves of food with $2 per batch, Susan will have to buy 6 batches of food with a price of $13.20 (30*0.66). To make the potatoes, you will need 36 potatoes to make 30 serves. If we divide the cost of the potatoes ($4) by the cost to make one portion of food ($0.25), is will take 16 potatoes to make one batch of food.

Choices:  When: A: first thing in morning B: between 6:00 and 7:00 C: early morning D: sunrise is different at different places E: late morning\nRationales:\n1. A sunrise is defined as the time at which the sun appears on the Eastern horizon.\n2. The Eastern horizon is the horizon that points East, which can be seen while standing in one\u2019s own country, state, or city.\n3. When a sunrise happens at one place, the sun rises at the same time the same sun rises in another place.\n4. Therefore a sunrise is different in different places.\n5.

A sunrise can be in the first thing in the morning, between 6:0 0 and 7: 00 AM, in the morning, or sunrise is different depending on when it is.\n7. If I am in a place where sunrise is at 6: 00 AM then it cannot also be between 6: 0 0 and 6: 30 AM, because sunrise at 6: 3 0 AM occurs when it has already been 30 minutes past sunrise.\n8.

This is the first step of the process, as it determines the initial group of marbles that are needed to make the change requested. Now, three marbles were used to make the change. The solution above states that three marbles were used; why this is the case is the following. In the example problem there were three types of scenarios: the first one involved a single user of the change, the second situation involved two users of the change, and the third situation involved three users of the change. In the first scenario, the 3 marbles were required. The following equation was used to derive this answer: 1 Marble + 1 Marble + (Number of Marbles Needed for 5 Marbles) = 5 Marbles. However, in the second and third scenarios, the 3 Marble rule has to come into place. The 1 Marble is sufficient, the second 1 Marble is not needed, and the final marble is not needed. So in the second scenario, only 1 Marble is needed; this same argument can be used in the third scenario.

{"text": "3.60\n\n### Rationales: 1) The context is a restaurant which provides steak and egg meals that cost $16 each. James and his friend chose to order food separately. While James ordered steak, he opted not to order eggs. Since the steak and egg meality costs the same, there were no additional charges. Furthermore, the only additional charge occurred when the friend paid for his friend's portion of the bill and James paid additional 20 %.\n2) If both ordered the steak and eggs and paid for the meals, they would have had to pay an additional $1.50 for each of the meals they ordered. In total, this would cost them $20.75.\n2) James had to pay $16 to cover for his meal. His friend paid a total of $21.20 since he covered the cost for his own meal, the tip, and part of James' meal.\n3) The total cost for 20% of their bill came out to be$30.20, given the context and figures the problem provides. James' bill was $20.50 and his friend's bill was $21.25. \n4) James' bill (20.50) x 0.20 (tip) = 4.10\n5) $4.10 is 1/5 of $20.5 which comes to $3.60.\n6) Therefore, James must have paid $3.60 for the bill to be completely paid.\n7) The correct answer is $3.60\n###", "answer": " 21"}

It breaks, collapsing into a folded wedge, such that what was previously the tip of the flag pole is now dangling 1 foot above the ground. How close from the base in feet would the flag pole have collapsed if it would have collapsed on an angle of 60 degrees.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n#### Reason 1:\n\n1. A 10 foot tall flagpole breaking into a wedge such that the top is now dangling at 1 foot above the floor, is described in two terms (height, angle), where the angle is already explained.\n\n2. So we can eliminate option A.\n\n3. Similarly, option B is also eliminated because 'folding into a wedge' can be either vertical or horizontal based on the force of the break, and option B is specific to a horizontal break.\n\n4. 'Vertical' is what the initial description of the break describes so we can eliminate option C.\n\n5. Option D, 'at a 60 degree angle' is also incorrect because it's impossible for the flagpole to break at a 60 degree degree angle.\n\n6.

{"text": "Ludwig works 7 days a day and he usually works half a day on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. If his daily pay is $10, then he earns $50 every week.\n\n### Rationale: 1. There are three instances of ambiguity to consider here. The first is about how exactly Ludwig earns each day. It stands to reason that he earns $10 if he works half of the day, but what if he simply isn't paid? If he's not paid on Fridays, Satrudays, and Sundays, then he's not earning $10. The second ambiguity is regarding the days of the week and Ludwig's daily schedule. The only explicit description in the puzzle is \"Friday, Saturday, and Sunday\". Does \"Friday, Saturd...\n\n... day, and Sunday\" mean he works at the maximum capacity on this three days. Does this phrase mean the last three days of the week, Friday through Sunday? Third ambiguity: What's \"half of a day\"? What if Ludwig \"halfs\" by working for 5 hours on certain days? Is he earning a whopping $10 per hour? Also, he should earn $10 if he doesn't work too. The only possible answer that fits all these points is that on Fridays, Suturdays, and Sundays, he works half of a day or 5 hours, and that's enough to earn him $50.", "answer": " 55"}

The bird who can make more rational and better decisions should be allowed to teach.\n2. While the bigger brain is often associated with smarter and better decision making, it may not always be the case in every situation.\n3. For example, in a group of birds, a bigger brain may not always make the decisions that benefit the entire group.\n4. On the other hand, a small brain may have better social skills and be able to quickly determine how to make better decisions for the group.\n5.

{"text": "$4 ($10 + 2 x $2)\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales:\n1. If one looks up the definition of charcuterie, it says \"French food consisting of thinly sliced cured meats, usually accompanied by an assortment of pickled, cheese- or mushroom-based small plates.\" (Merriam-Webster, 2022)\n2. In this case, it's the first part that is relevant, since the rest is what \"he serves\" and that's the only part that we have information on\n3. The food he's looking to serve is thinly sliced meats, which implies he is looking to use cheese, cream cheese and cold cuts.\n4. Since the question directly asks us to determine the amount he's spending on ingredients, which we can assume includes both the prices and quantities, we need to compute the quantities of each ingredient, and also the total cost of them all.\n5. First, we identify the ingredients: \"cheddar cheese, cream-cheese, and cold cuts\", there are three ingredients total.\n6. Now, we need to break down the quantities of each ingriedient as given. \"Jasper will serve 2 pounds of chest cheese\" is the quantity of cheddar chees, which means he serves two pounds of cheddar.\n7. We then look at the two quantities of cream cheese and can compute the quantity (quantity*cost) of each. If he bought one pound of cheese at half the cost of cheddar, that would imply one pound of cream-cheese costs about half as much as cheddar.\n8. Similarly, the quantity of cold cuts is also computed by quantity*cost. We know that he's willing to spend double the money on cold cuts as compared to cheddar cheese and cream cheese.\n9. So the total cost of ingredients is $10 for cheddar, $5 for cream cheese, and $10 for cold cuts\n10. Hence, the total cost of ingrdiants is $4, thus the total amount spent on ingredients is $4.\n11. \"Answer:", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "#### Input:Between which integers?\n\n### Direction\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The question is describing a situation where a boxer has to follow a specific diet.\n2. Hence we can eliminate all options except for those that involve a limit on how much weight the boxer will lose per month.\n3. The only options that involve a monthly limit are A and B, so we can eliminate all the rest of the options.\n\n### Input (B):Between which integers?:\n\n4. The question is asking where a boxer will weigh between the starting weight of 97 kg and an end weight of 94 kg. Given that the monthly limit is 3 kg, we can use multiplication to solve for the boxer's end weight.\n5. Since the monthly limit is from a starting weight of 94, we can multiple that starting weight times 3 to get the maximum allowed end weight the boxer can have.\n6. Thus 94 x 3/3 = 94 x 1 = 94\n7. So the answer is going to be 94\n \n### Input (C):\nA man went to his dentist. The dentist took him to the clinic room, told him to sit on the surgical chair and told him to open wide.

The number of fish in the aquarium at the start equals the number of clown+bfs.\n3. The sum of the number of blowfish now in the aquarium plus the number of clowns back in the cfs tank must equal the sum of the number of cfs in the aquarium plus whatever number they got rid of.\n4. The sum of these two numbers must also equal the initial number of total fish, that is, the sum of all cfs and all bfs.\n5. We can eliminate one option because the number of bfs is not equal to the number of cfs.\n6. We now know that the aquarium must hold an equal number of cfs and bfs, so one half of the remaining fish must be cfs and one half must be bfs, as each fish is indistinguishable from the other for the purpose of the question.\n7. The sum of these options must be greater than the initial number of total cfs because it is made up of the number of clownis from the initial number.\n8.

The $300 and the $120 need to be added together to get $420, so we need to subtract $60 from $315.\n\n$315 - $60 = $255, which is the total cost of the first two visits.\n\nThe third part is the cost of the second visit. That sum is $120.\n\nThe fourth part is the percentage of insurance for the second visit. 60% of $120 is $72.

We could rewrite it as \"we bought it for $320 less than the list price\". The question wants us to find out how much the James spent. From the question \"Then was able to haggl\", we know that he bought the car at 90% of the sticker price. Knowing he paid $320 less for the car, we can calculate how much he spent in cash. $20000/1.80= $~11666.66 + $28000-320(buy at $2000-$1800)=28032. Which means he spent $28032 for car.

The guest was to be invited out of the envelope and that was where all the mystery was at. \n\n### Response\n\nWhat we need to do is to work out the number of invites that the guest will be receiving as well as the guest who will invite him/her (who we call the guest in the envelope). It is important to note that in the case, all guests will be receiving an envelope as they cannot invite everyone else to the party and it's one of them who will be receiving their invitation.\n\n### So, what we are going to do is to work on the question and understand what is being asked before we begin. We can do that by reading it over and noting the key components in the question. The key components are who is giving the invitation and what is the number of invites they are receiving.  \n\n### First up, who is giving the invitations?

If the price of a gallon is $3.59, I can find the price per gallon by dividing $3.59 by 4, since there are 4 gallons in a quart. In this example, I would pay $8.35 for 8 gallons of gas.\n\n### Rationales (Division):\n1. $3.59/$4=$0.94875. \n2. $3.58 / $4 = 0.895. \n3. $3.57 / $4 = 1.26. \n4. $3.56 / $4 = 2.0125. \n5. $3.55 / $4 = 3.5625. \n6. The most likely price of the gallon of gas is $2.90 because 3.55 is very close to $2.90 and $3.5624 is close to $2.\n\nWe can use this equation to calculate the price of a gall, $3.56, and the price of a gall of gas, 2.90. We would calculate 3.56/4, obtaining 0.39125. That number represents the price of each gall. We can convert 0.39 to 39/1000. If 100 = 100/100, then 0.39 = 39/1,000.

Furthermore, we can eliminate \"dam\" as it describes an artificial object which doesn't directly relate to the question.\n4. Lastly, we can eliminate \"lake\" as it does not have physical characteristics that would be easily crossed by the bicyclist unless it is very shallow or there is a bridge.\n5.

The Skipper is heading to a destination that is 800 kilometers away, and it took 20 hours of traveling at 30 kilometers an hour to get one-third of the journey's distance.\n2. That means the Skipper reached one-third of his destination's distance in 40 hours.\n3. After he turned off his engines, a storm blew him backward for 20 hours, setting his new position 200 kilometers behind where he'd originally been.\n4. That gives him 700 kilometers in total to reach his destination.\n5. To get those final 700 kilomters, he has to travel at 30 kilomters an hour for an additional 23 and a half hours, since he's now twice as far from his destination as he used to be in the original scenario.\n6. So altogether, the Skipper has to travel 1,030 kilometers to get back where he needs to be.\n7. Taking into account the trip backward, he has 1000 kilometers total to travel, given that he's at the final third of his trip.\n8. He traveled 800 kilomters in the first 40 hours, and he was set back 200 kilomters in a 40 hour windstorm. So in total, he traveled 8,200 kilometers.\n9.

{"text": "The question asks us to determine how many points Paislee needs to score to have a chance of winning the round if Calvin had scored 1500 points.\n\n### Initial Response\n\nThe question states that Calvin had scored 4/5ths the points that Paislee had scored.\n\n\n### Initial Analysis \u21d2\n\n1. From the initial ratios, we can conclude that since C = 1500 and P = 3/4 P, P = 15 \u215c \u00d7 3/4 P = 92 \u215b.\n2. Since C = 15 \u00d7 \u215e, by distributive property, we can rewrite the 15 \u00d7 1/8 as 1 4/8 \u00d7 15/8 = 32/8, i.e. C = \u215d \u00d7 32/8 = 16/8, or C = 128/8.\n3. To get an even number of points for the round, we need 16  x ((15 + 1)/2) = 16x9 = 144, which is a total of P + C (or 92 + 128) = 220 points.\n4. Therefore the required points for Paislee are 220 - C or 220 - (128) and this gives us ~152 points.\n\n## Initial Analysis Revisited\n\n1. While doing the ratios, the answer was initially calculated by finding: 1/2 (15 \u215e) = 15/8 i.e. 19/8 = 9/8 = 3/8 i.e 3 \u215b \n2. After this we proceed to multiply 3 \u215d by 32/8 to get 128/16.\n2. However, we later find that the ratio P(3/4 \u00d7 C) is 1/2 (3/4 \u00d7 1500), and so we must proceed to simplify this equation further, which gives us the ratio 1/2 (500\u00d73/4) which gives us 500 \u00f73/4 \n3.

Some scientifically trained people spend their time studying the cave formations. In the question, it does not mention what type of geological structure, so there would be no reason to infer the type of formation the structure might have. Therefore the answer is a) stalactites.\n\n### Rationale 2 :\n\nOption b is also correct because caves formations are called caves\n\nOption b is not the correct answer because no caves are mentioned in the question. The question only mentions some caves.\n\nOption c is a correct answer because no cae can mean that there is no stalactites. The question gives the impression that scientific experts of that field might be searching for stalactites (still considering that stalactites might be caves and vice versa).\nHowever that is not true and one can deduce based on the information given so far the following:\nThere might not be any real caves at all with stalactites, but most likely there are some in which the formation (known as stalgmites) have been created.

Two or more pencils refer\nto the situation where a bag containing at least two pencils is chosen at random, which\ndoesn't take into account the first bag.\n\nThis question asks about the probability of a bag that is placed on the left side of\nthe box. By our definition of the box on the left side of it, the first bag will always be\nplaced on the left side of box. This leaves us with only one bag left on the right side\nof the box. In this situation there's only one bag left on our side, so this bag must\ncontain at least one pencil. This means that out of all the bags on the left side or\nthe box there are only two bags that could contain two or more pencil so that the\nprobability can be determined.\n\nFirst, we know that there's two bags on the left. The box has 927 pencils total, leaving\n927/2 chances for each bag total, or 463/2 for each bag chance.

This was because the sale of 13 \"TOP\" books earned around $8 x 13 = $104  in the bookstore' s profits, while the sale of 4 \"E\" book only earned $4 x 4 = $16  in the bookstore's profits, making the difference approximately $104 -$16, equal around $109.\n\n### Input\n```\nA: a store owner\nB: the money in the cash register\nC: the cash register with the money in it\nD: the change made\n\n```\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demos:\n\n### Instuctions:\nI dont know where to start, there's not much that is wrong here, only the thing that I see is the first sentence of the question is A bit long but its alright. and that's it", "answer": " 12"}

A low elevation push-up is done placing the palms on a higher elevation, but not on the floor.  I choose option C as solution because John is training with different push-ups to be able to do the floor push-ups.\n\n#### Rationale\n\n1. The first paragraph gives details explaining and describing the exercises John has to do, so we can eliminate options without a description.\n2. In the first description of the exercises, it is very clear that John is training to perform each exercise in stages, making it obvious that John would not jump right into doing the elevated versions of push-ups.\n3. Hence, the choices D, E, and F don't make sense as they represent the other elevated versions of push ups. A push up is an exercise in which you raise and lower your body using your arms only. So we can eliminate A, B, C, and D. We only have three choices left. High elevated, Low elevated, and Flat. But if we keep track of the details from the beginning, like John training \"days a week\", we see that he does 5 walls in the beginning then at about 15 reps. he then does 5 high elevated, then at about 19 reps he then does 5 low elevated and on the last exercise he does 10 flat. This is when he does the floor. So with that information we have only 1 option left, C.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "#### And Andy's answer would be 39 tomatoes.\n\n### Rationale:\nOption A isn't the correct answer for 2 reasons.\n1. The total of the tomatoes cannot exceed 39 as, as per the given expression, we have to multiply the number of tomatoes that were harvested (18*7) or 126, so, 126 cannot exceed 39.\n\n2. Also, we have 2 choices for the final number of tomatoes, so, we divide them by 2 and we have the option C which can be further divided to 65+34=99 or 99+34=133, now the largest multiple of 7 is 28, that could not exceed Andy's tomatoes and hence would fail the condition that the number of tomatoes could not exceed 3/7*5 + 3 * 39 = 16 + 107 = 123\n\n#### And, option C's answer would be -9 or -8.\n\n1.

Therefore, we have to check if 63 and 93 could ever exceed this number, we'd have to multiply 63*2*7+64*2 or (63+1044)/7 or (167/7) = 23 tomatoes which definitely exceeds 3/7 * 5 + 3 = 42 which fails the second condition mentioned earlier in the option A.

The total number of miles Tracy drives is given as 2000 miles, so the total distance of the trip is 1000+2000 = 3000 miles\n3. To find Michelle's mileage, we first subtract the total miles by 2000 = \u22121000\n4.

{"text": "6 + 14/2\n\n### Rationale:\n\nWhen using integers to solve problems, all you must do is sum the individual integer values and then divide by the number of integers. (I don't provide a solution because the student is supposed to come up with it on their own, but this is a method that can be used to solve any integer problem)\n\n### Input\nFred spent half of $7.00 on going to the movies and then washed the family car to earn $6.00. What is his week allowance if he ended up with $14.00?\n\n### Rationales\n\nHere, I'll be writing out the thought process I used to get to the answer. I'll then provide the answer, but this question can be done without me providing the answer.\n\nWhen solving a question like this, my process typically goes something like this:\n\n1. I write the question into my own words without using numbers. In other words, I put what the original question asks in my own words and use more general terms rather than specific dollar amounts and other information.\n\n2. I rewrite the question using fractions or ratios, rather than integers. For instance:  \n( 1 / 2 of $7.0= $3.50)\n\n3. Then I think about the answer. \n\n4. I always try to avoid adding fractions if possible, as this makes the numbers more difficult to convert into dollars and other things.\n\n5. The answer is $3.5 plus $2, or $5.5. The question wanted the amount to the nearest dollar, so I rounded it up to $6.0. \n\nI can take this answer to the original question this way:\n\nFred spent $3.50 on going to the movie (this was the $3.5 I figured out earlier). Then Fred was trying to end up with $6.00 as his allowance (so he has $5.50 left). Then Fred spent the last $5.50 by washing the family car.\n\nIn this way, I was able to use my original thought process and get the same answer as the teacher.\n\n### Rating:\n\nThis was probably one of the best tasks I've written so far.", "answer": " 16"}

There are organizations that give out grants to people in need, and the government also helps people who have a low G.I. score.  These steps help to create a more caring society.  Not everyone needs to become a millionaire to help out, and with a little work and effort, everyone can have a safe, secure, life-long job.\n\n### Rationale:\"One can start by giving  them little bit of a money and this will help them from starving. There are lots of organizations that can help you to give  a little bit of a money to people who are poor like United States and Canada and they will give you information for helping poor people with a little bit of money.

Expanding the brackets, we get: (B-1)x(B-1) = 1, giving B - 1 = +/- 1, or B = +/- 1.\n\n7.

We can rule out B and C, because these are units of time and are not something that Mr Caiden wants to pay for.\n2. Next we can rule out E, as this is not a unit of length, rather a measurement of distance that equals 100 yards(15,000mm) or 100 m.\n3. Finally, we can rule out C. It takes 250m to complete the job, which indicates that 250m are part of the job required to complete. Therefore, $8 will already be accounted for in this case.\n4. Therefore the unit of length Mr Caiden is required to purchase would be A.\n5. Since each foot is equal to 300 mm in length, Mr Caiden is required 12,000 mm or 12000m to complete the project.\n6.

But the offspring don\u2019t count as wolf hybrids in the strictest sense because they are not bred together.\nResponse: A species refers to a population of animals, typically animals in their natural habitat.

One of the methods of solving such types of problems is to subtract the smaller number from the larger number.\n\nSince the denominator, the larger number, is in this case 10, dividing both the denominator and numerator by 10 will give us the actual fraction, which is in this case 5/5 and 4/4.\n\nNow, since we know the ratio should be reduced it's better to do so with the denominator, which will result in our fraction being. If we simplify and reduce this fraction down to its lowermost terms we get a ratio of 1/2, which essentially denotes there is a ratio of 1:2.\n\nNow, using the \"fractional reduction\" method which basically means multiplying the ratio by the larger number in the problem, we get a fraction of. Since this result is a fraction of a fraction, we multiply it again with the numerator and the denominator to obtain a fraction of, which can then easily be converted into a decimal number of which gives us a sum of 78.\n\nTherefore this can be considered a correct sum.\n\nAnswer: D: 181\n\nInput: Which of the following did the doctor order for his patient with a fever?

{"text": "Alex has 5.0% left.\n\n### Rationale:\nAlex\u2019s pay comes to be given out as $500 as $500 - $50 - $55, which means he has $440 to distribute. His tithe then also comes to be $440 * 0.1, giving him $44. Now, that leaves out $40, which adds up to $40 + $500 - 51, in which the dollar difference between the $450 (500-51) he had before and the $40 he has now cannot be ascertained accurately. Thus, Alex has $500 \u2013 $450 - $40 = $500 - ($450+40= $850 - $450 = \\$400), which comes to $4.5%.\n\n### Input\n#### First: Alex gets paid $50,000 a week and pays his weekly water bills for $800 each. He also pays his rent for $1,050 each week. How much money does he have to save for tax season?\n\n#### Second: The answer is 93.6%.\n\n#### Ratiocination:\nIn the second case in which we had access to more information on where Alex was spending that money, we can clearly see that he\u2019s spending $1,680 a week on rent and only $500 on food and other amenities. In which case, his extraordinarily lavish amount of money goes primarily to paying rent. In which case, we can clearly see Alex\u2019s tithes are coming to be $500 + $70 + $50 = $680, because $50 is what his \u2018extras\u2019 allowance goes to, $70 is what his tithes go to, and $680 is what he\u2019d usually be giving away to God\u2019s cause.\n\nAt this point, it becomes clear that if Alex is to save his money and get by, we need to do a lot of work.

To determine her dogs, consider that if she has one dog walking it would only require two legs to untangle.  Because her dogs are tangled up with another's dogs' leashes, she must have at least 11 dog to leave hers and those of the dog walker free.  There are 6 legs attached to a dog walker walking a single dog.  This means that there are 6 legs left from Mariel's dog walker to the 18 legs, leaving Mariel with 10 dogs to account for herself.

She bought 100 space sticker and 50 cat sticker. \n\nThen we can divide 160 by 3 to find out approximately how many stickers each person will get. Let's consider the given values to be m, n, p and 461. \n\nFrom the values we have: 100m + 50p =461\n\nMultiplying both sides by m, we get m(100 m +50 p) = 461(m)\n\nDividing by 50 yields m(20) = 93\n\nIf 20 stands for m, this is equal to 4.65 which is close enough to an integer, so we round to 4.\n\nSince n = 50 and p = 50, this means that she would have 61 left (160 - 4.65 - 4.6)\n\nAnswer: A.

Choices:  S: Planting trees B: Minimizing greenhouse gases C: Building more nuclear power plants D: M: Using electric cars E: P: Banning gasoline-powered vehicles\n\n### Demostration : \n\nWe know that minimizing greenhouse gases is the one that needs the most energy. So, when you consider that you want to be reducing things that cause global warming, the one that's doing the most damage is option B. The next one to consider is option C. We know that greenhouses gases are the number one cause of global warming, so if we're minimizing greenhouses gases, we will be minimizing global warming. So, that might actually be the answer, just not as clear. If you're banning the cars that use gasoline, you are cutting down the number of people that use gas more. This would minimize the amount of energy people use. Banning gasoline doesn't cut down the amount of greenhouses gases in the atmosphere, as option D is the one that does that. Minimizing greenhouses gasses doesn't necessarily cut down the need to use cars, as we've already shown in our analysis of option B that cutting down on greenhouses gasseses doesn't necessarily prevent global warming, which leads us to option and option would be the answer, the right answer.\nRationales :\n1. It's asking the question, \"Which of the following would be the most helpful in preventing the prevention of global warming?\". If we look at these answer choice, we know that option S and M both say \"prevention\", and so do option E and C so we know immediately they won't be the right answer. This eliminates option S and M, as they both mention prevention.\n2. Option E mentions banning gasoline-powerd vehicles. So if its banning gasoline-powerd vehicles that would be helpful, then we should eliminate all the other choices that use gasoline in some way. These choices are option D,C and B. So we eliminate options C and D because they use gasoline, but we also know that option D is minimizing greenhouses in the atmosphere.", "answer": " 7425"}

{"text": "92.33 feet\n\n### Rationale:\n\nIn the given problem, we are provided with all the necessary details.  A logical method for solving this question can be found in the first two steps using the following equation:\n\n$s_1 = 10 * s_2$\n\ns1 is equal to the number of steps in the first staircase.  We can then use the value of s1 from one equation to substitute it in the other to be sure our steps are correct.\n\nSo, we can plug in 10 and we have:\n\n$10 * s_1 = 140$, which means the number of steps in our 2nd staircase is 140.\n\nAnd, we have:\n\n10 = 140 * ( s2/s21)\n\ns2 is equal to the number or steps in the second staircase and so is\n\n$140 = 10 * ( s2 / s1)$\n\nThis is our third and final equation, which allows us to solve for the values of s2 and s3.  We know that s3 is less than the value of s2 since we are told that each step is 0.8 feet.\n\nSo, plugging s2 = 140, we have:\n\t$\\boxed{140 * ( 0.5s3/s1) = s1 * 0.5}$\n\nAnd since 0.5 is not s3 but s3 is less than s2, we can distribute the 0.5 like so:\n\n\t$\\boxed{( 0.5s2/s1) * ( s2/140) = s1 * ( 0.002/14)}$\n\nWith that value for s2, s1, we have:\n$\\boxed{( 2/7)s1 = 0.0018}$ and then s1 =0.00142857.\n\nAt this point we can multiply by 10 since 0.5 means the steps are 0.5 feet high.\n\n$\\boxed{10* 0.5*0.001 * 10 = 0.502m} =", "answer": " 45"}

This mistake was made at the end where I multiplied three times $80.  The correct answer is $240.  The answer is still useful and informative, however.}\n\n### Rationales:\nThe answer to this puzzles is $240/3, i.e. $80.\nThe first part states that each grandkid gets 2 cards and $80 for each card totals to $160 and diveded evenly between 3 grandkids totals to $80.\n\nNext, we need to double the $160 to cover cards/drawers, not just gift cards, so we get $320.\n\nFinally, the rest of the money covers the cards/drawers, so that's all the amount we need to cover.\n\nThe total gift equals to $640, but the total gift money is $240 that's why we get $240/2. \n\nSo the answer is $80 as 3 x $80 = $240\n\n### Input:\"If it's not on the road, it's in the way.\"  A woman was walking in the middle of road and a man was walking behind her.

{"text": "The grill ran for twenty-eight minutes, since each bag of coals holds sixty coals, the grill used 30 coals each time it refilled the fire. Fifteen coals burn every 20 minutes, and ten minutes in a bag. Each time the coals are refilled, the time elapsed does exactly half the total time it took to burn that bag in the first place. For example, fifteen 20 minute periods, equals 300 minutes.

Scrip: A form of money you can use to pay your debts to a store or a landlord. Usually used in situations where you don't have any real money.\n2. Bargaining power: The ability to negotiate for the best deal you can get.\n\n### Example Response with Scrip:\n\n### Instructed Response:\nRenee works in the city and she doesn't have any cash with her so the bank gives her scrip to help pay her tab. Scrip helps her get what she needs but it can take time to get all her debts collected.\n\n### Answer: A: \n\nScrip was a form of currency used by many before money, paper and cards came into existence. It was a small piece of paper that looked like money written on it, but most of the time, it was backed by the government. Because of this, it was easy to use and easy to pay with.\n\n### In-depth analysis:\nScrip or \"promise money\" was a form of currency that was used between people who owed and those who were owed. Scrip was paper money or notes that would be given by a store or government to an individual who owed money for goods. The idea behind scrip was that the store could accept the scrip that the individual owed them at a later date, and then the store would exchange the scrip for goods. For example, a store may offer a customer an item or service worth $10 by accepting a $10 scrip if that was all the customer had to pay.\n\n### Writing tips: \n\n- Always use complete sentences and have at least 2 or more sentences per paragraph.", "answer": " 1200"}
{"text": "Answer: 17\n\n### Support:\nInput: You need 3 parts of a cake to share at a birthday party. Choices:  A : One whole cake with enough to spare. B : Two whole cake with enough for a slice for each guest. C : Three whole cakes\nRationales: Let's look into the rationale of the question\n1. Let's take choices A and B and then look into if it is a whole scenario or can we apply mathematical reasoning to it.\n2. 3x10 = 30 but if we take into account the slice that each person is having it will be  3x9 = 27. Hence, options A and B should be eliminated.\n3. Next, let's look at Option C. Does it seem like there is enough quantity of cakes?\n4. Let's understand the scenario one more way. You have 3 parts of cake to cut for 6 people and one part is left over as there are not enough parts of the cake to cut everyone their piece.\n5. From this, we can deduct that in the case of option C, there will only be 3 cakes left.\n6. To know the exact number of remaining cakes, we multiply the number of friends having birthday   by 3.\n7. 6x3 = 18.\n8. As there is 1 cake left, the number of remaining cakes = 18 - 1 = 17\n9. The total number of cakes required  = 30\n10. There is a discrepancy between the number of friends in this example, but this should not impact the answer. Option C is correct.\n11.

{"text": "Anna gets 14 pieces for 60 houses. So if one house is equal to 14, there's 60 houses. Anna would get 840 pieces of candy.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. A subdivision (in the sense of a city district) has many houses.\n2. A house is also a structure designed for living in, so one house can be equal to one piece of candy.\n3. Subdivision houses (like any other houses) are not connected to each other, so houses in the subdivision are independent from the houses in the other subdivision.\n4. There's no connection in the given details between a city district and its houses, so to find the correct ratio, we must multiply each house in the subdivision by 14.\n5. One city district has 60 houses, so multiplying the number by 14, one would get 84 per house.\n6. The other city district has 75 houses. Therefore, it will have the same amount of candy.\n7. The answer is A: 840 pieces.\n\n### Input:#1 The first time I rode a bike as fast as I could I crashed into a pole. \n\n##### Rationale:\n\nThe option that fits the sentence is option 3.\n\nSince in option 2, it states that the pole had no eyes, and that cannot be a pole.\n\nAlso in the option 3 it states a pole has 4 legs.\n\nAnd finally since the third option states that when the person is going to fast like as much as he or she can, its impossible to crash into a pole.\n\n### #2 I had a good feeling about this job interview!\n\n##### Rational:\n\n1.

This incorrect response suggests the question should read \"how many situps (does it) take to meet (your) goal?\".

Thus, 'it' should be replaced with 'her' to refer to Shawna and maintain this grammatical structure.\n2. The response also suggests that Shawna has a goal, which is incorrect. The question only asks us to answer how many situps Shawna needs to do to get the'minimum goal', which does not specify a'maximum goal'. Therefore, this should read: \"How many situps does Shawna need to do to meet her minimum goal?\"\n3. The response also says that Shawna met her goal.

However, according to the answer choice, we must include the number of cars that travel Happy Street on the weekend as well. Thus, we also have the requirement to find the number of cars on Mon - Sat.

We can then answer the question. \n\nNext, we can write the Sparkling Water price and identify the difference. \n\nWe see that to find the Sparkling Water cost in Cents ($.50) at the grocery we have to subtract $6.00 from 12.00, since the grocery only has 12.0 bottles for $12. We can see that we are going in the direction to find the Sparkling cost in $/can. \n\nNow we can plug those numbers into the 48 cans price and we find that it is cheaper to get Sparkling Water at the bulk warehouse per case compared to the grocery store per case. $19.60 per 48 vs $24 per 12. \n\nThe grocery store is therefore $4.40 per can more expensive than the sparkling water at the bulk warehouses. \n\nThus the grocery store Sparkling Water cost per can is 48-4 / 48 x 12 = $0.50  \n\n### Dont ask:\n\nWhat is the difference between these two prices?

According to the previous rationale, Mario paid $16 on Monday. According to the explanation from the previous rationale, haircuts are twice as expensive due to the weekend.

{"text": "The method of solving this problem is to solve a system of equations.\n\nThe key is to be able to distinguish the number of touchdown passes and the number of touchdown scores. Touchdown passes are determined by the team winning the game, and thus, 15 will be the maximum number of touchdown passes a player can score, unless the team has scored more than 15 touchdowns for the season as a team, but that is not applicable since it would mean the team would be undefeated for the entire season. This then allows the team to win 16 games, which will result in 2 extra touchdown passes over 15. We can therefore determine that there is a total of 18 touchdown passes for the entire season, and since there is 16 games, the maximum number of points he can have from touchdown passes is 120. The formula for touchdown points is TD=6. 120=6*16=6*18=24. We can then determine a similar formula, but now multiplied by 2, for the number of touchdown conversions. This is because there are two options for that, so the number in the formula multiplies by 2. The formula for the number of touch down conversions is Touchdown conversions=6. This results in 120(2)=240 points. We can then apply this information to the number of points James scored in the season to get 90/240. This number is equivalent to 3.75.

This year Bush would be twelve years old. What will Matt's age ten years from now be?\n\nRationales:\n1. The first piece of information given is that Bush and Matt are both brothers.\n2. It can be inferred that Bush and Matt have some familial relation but are not necessarily related as brothers by birth.\n\n3. The second piece of information is that Bush is younger than Matt and that this year, he would be twelve years old which implies that this year would be his fourteenth year of age.\n\n4. Additionally, it can be inferred that this scenario is set in motion by this year.\n\n5. The third piece of information is that Matt\u2019s age ten years hence will be one year less than Bush\u2019s age ten years from this scenario\u2019s creation.\n\n6. Since all we know about Matt is that he is older than Bush, we can narrow this situation down.\n\n7. However, knowing that both Bush and Matt have some type of connection, we can eliminate the option A: twenty-three years old.\n\n8. There is no way for Matt to become thirty-one years old in one scenario. Bush, however, could conceivably become thirty-one years in one scenario.\n\n9. Therefore, we can conclude that the situation being described can occur if Matt is twenty-four years old this year and Bush is twelve this year.\n10. Since we already know that Bush would be twelve this year, then Matt would be fourteen this year.\n\n11. Therefore, we can state that ten years after the fourteen year old Matt in the first year would be twenty-four, we can state that his second and third year combined will be at least twenty-seven, then the age of Matt in year three plus the combined age of the four year old Bush, fourteen and five will be twenty-nine.\n\n12. There is no other combination that will yield the age of thirty-one.\n\n13. We have the sum of Bush + Matt = thirty-one to prove this.\n\n14. Therefore, the answer will be D: twenty-nine.", "answer": " 25"}

This means that the number of hammers cooked so far will be the same as the number of hambers that will be cooked (15 is same as 15).\n\nFrom the information given, we can know that 55 hamburgers will be cooked in all. Also, we know that 5 hamburgers are to be cooked remaining.\n\nUsing this information, and the definition of the number of sessions given in the problem statement (1 less than the number of times when many hamburgers are cooked), we get a formula:\n\nnumber of sessions = 1 - cooked number of hamburgiers\n\nUsing the formula, we get:\n\nsession =115 - 15\n\nsession =100\n\nSince session is an integer and the range of integers in the given problem statement is between 1 and 15, the options for this problem statement will be the integers in this range.\n\nFrom the integer options, the choice that has a value closest to that range is E: 20.\n\nAnswer: E: 20\n\n### Instructions: A person who doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t like to be alone is ________ and a person who likes to be far away from people is _________\n\n### Answer:\n(A) anti-solitude (B) lone (C) lonely (D) solitude (E) social\n\n### Instructor:\nAnswer:\n(E) social\n\nAnswer: A: B: C: D: E:", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The number of candies Nellie, Jacob, and Lana each get is 26\n\n### Demosntration:\nThe question states that Nellie can eat 1/5th of the total candies (12), Jacob can eat 1/10th of the total candys (6), and Lana can eat 1/4th of the total candy (4). This means Nellie can eat 60 sourball candies (because she eats 12), Jacob can only eat 30 sourball candys (because he eats 6), and Lana eats 15 (because she eats three less than Jacob). \nIf they divide the remaining candys in the bucket (30) equally, the remaining candys for Nellie will be 18, the remaining candys Jacob get will be 3, and the remaining candys for Lana will be 16.\n\n### Rationales:\nWhen given a question based on a ratio, and provided the data for it (as was the case here), solve the question by replacing all the ratios with an integer. Since Jacob can eat 10th of the candies and they will divide it equally which means that after sharing they will get 5 candies in total. Because Lana is 1/4 th of what Jacob could eat and she was given 2 candies in her initial quota. There will be 8 candies left and 3 is 1/5 of 8 which makes 16/5=3. The last remaining candy will be 16, and that is Nellie's share. Thus, Nellie's share would be 18+16=34/5=6+1/5=6 which is equal to 27 sourball candies.

{"text": "He can buy 6 different key chains as he can only buy 3 pieces of keychains for $2.\n\n### Deduction:\nWe can clearly deduce the solution to the question by the simple concept of using all of the items until there is only a single item remaining. \n\nHowever, the question does not clearly ask for this, and instead asks for the number of the key chains, implying that the answer doesn't need to be one.\n\nThis can be clearly established by the fact that the wording of the question uses the phrase 'how many'.\n\nIf the intention was to seek which item can be bought, the question could have been phrased \"Which key chain can I buy for $2?\"\n\nThat said, the wording of \"how many\" does imply that the answer can be one keychain, or multiple. \n\nEven though this could be stated as an assumption to prove a point, this is the best way to establish that the question wording allows multiple items to be bought.\n\nThe reason we don\u2019t believe that Timothy is only able to purchase one item is that the given numbers appear to be random numbers.\n\nThe $10 price of a bag indicates that the keychain and bag prices also follow the same pattern. If Timothy wanted to purchase only one keychain he could have either purchased 1 keychain from the $2 option, or purchased 9 of the $2 keychains to arrive at the required cost of $18 which is the price of a $30 bag.\n\nTherefore, since there is no indication as to which of the two prices is considered the best purchase according to price, it could be argued that the answer can be any number of keychains and the problem can be solved using the keychains.\n\nHowever, the wording of the sentence states that the answer \"does not need to be one.\"\n\nThis means that while the answer can be any  number of keychains, the number is not equal to one. Therefore, there is no logical reason to assume that the number is equal to one, and only one. In this instance, the option with the least quantity of keychains is the correct answer.\n\nIf we are to assume that the answer can only be one, we can further deduce that Timothy can purchase 2 bags.\nThis follows an easy", "answer": " 21"}

The second question is about how long it takes in total to make pizza dought.\nc. The third and final question of the problem is about the time of oven capacity time it takes to make pizza. \n\n3. To answer the first question, we must consider the definition of batch size. \na. Batch size is the number of units produced simultaneously under continuous process conditions.\nb.

So, the next step is to eliminate the possibilities of the batch size.\nb. At the same time, we must keep in mind that batch size is not the amount of time it takes to make the pizza. \n5. There is an elimination in the batch size option. \na. 12 pizza can be produced at once from dough, so the options need to be reduced to batch sizes higher than 12 pizza.\n6. Now we must eliminate all the options but the closest answer possible to 3 pizza dough. \na. Therefore we must choose 30 minutes.\n7. We can eliminate the options that cannot make 3 pizza dought. \nb. 50 can only make 2 pizza (not 3) so it cannot be the batch size.\na. 58 is not 30, so it is not a batch size option.\n\n8.

From here, we can eliminate C, since Kat spends 7 hours on strength training, the minimum of 2 hours on boxing gym, and the remaining 7-2=5 hours on her gym training.

{"text": "30\n\n### Rationale:\n1. First, look at the difference between one book and two books: 180 pages - 100 pages = 80 pages. If Yasna reads 80 pages in two weeks, she can finish two books in two weeks, so the difference between 80 pages and 180 pages is 180 - 80 = 100.\n2. Then, notice that Yasna says that if she reads an equal amount per day, then she can read about 100 pages in two weeks. So 100 pages / 2 weeks = 50 pages. But 50 pages is an even number, so Yasna will have enough time in a day to read 50 pages for one day.\n3. So if she reads 50 pages for half of the days, then she would have to read a total of 100 pages + 25 pages = 125 pages by the end of the two weeks.\n4. Notice that since Yasna read an equal number of pages, she read 25 pages each day on average.\n5. Therefore, it would be:\n\n    125 \\over 25 = 5 books.\n    5 books \\over 2 weeks = 2.5 books per week.\n    2.5 books per day.\n    (Since books are the same either way, 2.5 books is the same as her reading 2.5 x 100 pages and 1.25 books is the same number of pages as her reading 25 pages each.)\n6.

{"text": "The solution is A: 400\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade division question.\nInput: To what division would I compare a high school that has a graduation rate of 65% and an average enrollment of 3500 students? Choices: \u2154 A: small school B: medium school C: large school D: public school E: private school\nRationales: Here it's important that we understand the term 'comparison' and the context surrounding 'division'\n\n1. Comparison is a comparison made between two or more items.\n\n2. When considering division, a division describes a division of something into two or more parts based on its nature, use or purpose.\n\n3. With a better understanding of the term 'comparison', it's now time to consider the details of the provided choices.\n\n4. Although, A: small school, B: medium school, and D: public school could be considered divisions due to their nature and purpose, they cannot be used to compare the given information as they are specific to certain locations.\n\n5. Since the school is not located in a specific region, the choice of division must be made more objectively.\n\n6. Similarly, the choice of E: private school could also be considered a division, though it too is inappropriate for the context as the school, regardless of division, is not in some region or country.\n\n7. Therefore, the choice of C: large school, which is the only choice that can be used for comparison, would be the correct choice.\n8. As it covers a large number of students in a population, it will be most relevant for comparison with the context.\n\n9. Therefore, 65 divided by 1500, which in this case is the school's enrollment, is 0.43, and we can round this to a whole number to get 0.5.\n\n10.

The problem asks us for the percentage of people who didn't get a raise. We know that \"50%\" refers to half of the population. To get from a percentage to a percentage, we divide by percentage:\n50%*100 =50%//100 = 0.5\n\nSo, for this percentage problem, 0.5% of the respondents to the survey answered that they didn't get a pay raise.

{"text": "Lydia probably stole some bananas.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe above response answers this question fully as follows:\n\nIf Donna has 40 more than Lydia, and Lydia has 100 bananas, we get 50 bananas for Donna.

{"text": "$45\n\n### Demand: Explain Harry's earnings for each of the seven days.  Harry walks six more dogs on Thursday than he does on Tuesday.\n\n### Rationale:  We are told that Harry walks seven dogs on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Then it is further told that he walks twelve dogs on Tuesday and nine on Thursday. This implies that on Monday, Harry walks 5 dogs for 5 dollars. On Wednesday, Monday and Friday Harry walks 5 more dogs for 5 dollars on each day.\nOn Tuesday Harry walks 6 fewer dogs than on Monday + 5 -12 = 11 dogs for 110 dollars. On Thursday Harry walks 5 fewer dogs than on Monday, Tuesday and Friday. On Thursday 5 x 5 = (5 x 7) = 35 dollars. Adding to Thursday's earnings, we take the $35 and add it to the $85 that Harry has earned through Monday, Wednesday + Friday 85.  We then multiply that by four.  Harry's 4 day average for dog walks is $212.\n\n### Solution: Harry walks more dogs on Thursdays than on any other day. So for the average Monday, Wednesday, Friday he walks 7 dogs and on average Thursday he walloks 9 dogs. The average is obtained by the mean value theorem. We take the sum of the seven days - the sum of the nine days and divide them by the times that he walks a dog 7 x 7 = 49 = 49.25 and then divide it by 3 the days that he walks an extra dog 9 x 3 = 27. Harry walks an extra dog for about 0.5 days 3 x 7 = 21. 5 x 0.5 = 10 dollars.\n\n### Now take 49.2 x 3 x.25 = 14.72.\n\n## Input: The book \"Dogs and Their Behavior\" is a reference work that addresses the emotional, intellectual, social, and behavioral aspects of the dog.

Options A) abroad, D) out of town, make no sense as locations for this question.\n4. Option B) in school does not have the intended meaning as the location the question is looking for.\n5. Option E) in the store, could possibly be acceptable if that is some sort of local gathering or hangout/meeting place.\n6. Option C) at the bar seems to fit the meaning of 'at a social gathering'.\n7. Thus the answer is C) at the bar.\nAnswer: C: at the bar\n\n### Input : The man lost his wedding ring yesterday while he was cleaning the garage and did not find it until he cleaned the garage last night. How long did it take for him to find the ring? Choices:  Days A: 12 weeks B: 3 weeks C: 7 days D: 7 hours E: 4 days\nRationales: This question can be solved by using the Pythagoras's theorem.\nThe Pythagoras Theorem can be used to find the area of a rectangle and the sides of a triangle. Thus the area of the shape formed by the rectangle where the ring is found.\nAs the man lost the ring yesterday, when he cleared the garage, the rectangle formed by the cleared garage when the ring was found will be smaller than the one formed when the ring was lost. \n\nThis implies that the time at which he found the ring will be smaller compared to the time at which he lost the ring.\n\nThe length and height are the sum or difference of numbers of hours, minutes, etc.\n\nHence, the answer will be days D:7", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "The question asks about the relationship between certain amounts of avocados and the number of servings possible with each number of avocados. \n\nWe can assume there are different ways to divide the amount of avocados needed for some number of servings of guac. \n\nThe question requires us to find a quantity of avocados for which the total amount of servings is equal or less than a given number. \n\nA 3:1 ratio is used. We can reason that each 3:1 ratio will produce either half or 2/3 of a serving of guacamole.\n\nSince there are no variables besides the amounts of avocados present, this can be expressed as `y = x / 3`.\n\nSo, `n` avocados is exactly equal to half of `n+x`.\n\nSince there are `n+x` avocados total, `n + x = 3x`.\n\nSo, the number of servings is `3x.5 / 3 = 2x`.\n\n```{=2*5=10 servings of guac} ```", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "There aren't any half slices or quarters or eighths of a loaf of bread available. The way the question is worded, Melanie will just tear pieces of the two slices of bread into small enough pieces that they can fit inside the blender. The number of slices she is going to tear into pieces is not provided in the question, so she will use all of the bread, regardless of what size the pieces were before they were torn. There are two slices of bread and the recipe calls for the breadcrumbs to be made in a \"blender.\" This tells us that the meatballs are going to be ground into meatball 'flour.' Since 1.5 grams of protein is equivalent to one gram of fat, there is 75 times as much fat in a pound as there is protein. Therefore, Melanie will get 75 g of protein from her slices, plus some additional fat based on the recipe. This means she will end up with at least 75g of protein and possibly as much as 150g of protein to put into her meatball recipe.\n\n### Demo:\nInput: Where might one see this?

A map can hold a table somewhere, but it doesn't logically seem to be a place that one can find a table.\n3. A clock is a possible time table. However, school starts at 10 AM, meaning the school can only be on the clock's face once, so it isn't a valid choice.\n4.

He was trying to point out that you can think about how the amount of apples could relate to what the person already knows about the time it takes to complete a task.\n\n3. In this scenario, if one only has five minutes and a lot of apples to pick, they could get much more apples picked if they got a few people to help.\n\n4. Apples are a small and round food item so it wouldn't take too long to pick one when one would try to pick as many as possible.\n\n5. This could relate to what another person already knows when they are given a time to complete an activity without any help.\n\n6. They know how long they can be completing tasks in the time allotted.\n\n7. It would, therefore, be more efficient to get a person to help you pick apples in order to increase how many apples are picked in a shorter amount of times.\n\n8. Therefore, our answer to the question of how can one pick apples in 5 minutes is to get a person to be their helper and also to pick a medium to large amount of apples because they take little to no time to complete and if one has a lot of time they could pick a medium to large container of apples.\n\n### Input:(This part is a series of problems.

The question states that 3/5 of the people on William's coach were Dutch, meaning that 60/90=3/5=60%.\n\nThen, there are also some Americans in the group, and 2/3 of these Americans got window seats. We can say that this is 60 Americans who took a seat, so 60/99=1/2=60%.\nThis means then, that all the Dutch people in the seats on the bus were 60+60=120/99 of the people on the bus, or 60.2% of the entire group. This is 1/4 of the entire group, meaning that 1/4 of 90, or 22.5% (22.5/99=22.5%) are those who are of Dutch heritage and sat at the windows.\n\n### Hangman\n\n\n|_\n|_\n|__\n|_\n|-\n|_\n|___\n___-\n___-\n-___\n-----\n-\n-------\n-----\n------------\n---------\n-------------\n---------------\n--------------\n--------------\n---------------\n---------------\n-------------\n------------\n----------\n-----------\n-----------\n----------\n----------\n--------------\n-------------\n--------\n-------\n------\n-------\n-------------------\n-------\n-------\n-------\n---------------------\n-----------------\n----------------\n---------\n----------\n----------- \n-----------\n--------- \n------ \n-\n--------------\n------------\n---------------\n----\n-\n--\n---------\n------\n---------\n-\n-------------- \n-------\n---- \n------------\n------------\n-------\n--\n--------\n-----\n-------\n-------------- \n--------------\n------------ \n----------\n---------\n--------- \n--- \n----\n----------\n------------\n------------\n------------\n\n### Sites:\n- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/handbook/)\n- [Purdue's Online Writing Lab](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/)\n- [Citation Machine](https://citationmachine.", "answer": " 9"}

Choices: 45 A: inches B: feet C: miles D: miles per second E: liters\nRationales:1. The question asks about the amount of rainfall in the United States. From the context, this rainfall will likely be in the form of liquid (versus solid or gas), given that rain is a measure of precipitation (a liquid).\n\n2. The United States is generally a country that observes weather patterns and rainfall is one such meteorological event, so we can eliminate options A and B, as these would be unrelated to the United States.\n\n3. The options D, E, B and C are all units that would measure the aforementioned liquid, which is relevant to the given question. This makes these choices seem more plausible than the two previously mentioned options.\n\n4. While there are different types of rain that occur within the US, the most common rain that results in rainfall accumulation is what has been described in part A.\n\n5. This rain can come in the form of rain (precipitation), or rain that is frozen into ice crystals (sleet) or snow particles/crystals of water (snow). The rain is in the form of a fluid in the United States, so we can eliminate the non-fluid choices, leaving us with the choice E, where'miles' is a unit of distance.\n\n6. While miles are a unit of distance, they do not have a direct correlation to rain, and in particular the amount of rain that falls in the United States. There are other types of precipitation that can occur from snow or sleet, so we can eliminate choice E and leave the choice as A: inches.\n\n7. This makes the most sense when considered with the given context of the amount of rain rainfall in the US falls on average.\n\n8. Therefore, in the given context, it makes the most", "answer": " 15"}

The current president of the organization expects it will require additional resources such as office supplies, equipment rentals, and refreshments in addition to event-related supplies.

We can see this is other aspects of life such as cars, house, ect. It's a more likely scenario that a person will not spend on those things out of their pocket. However, it's more likely that they will buy a tickets to an event. In the end it's most likely that a greater amount of people will attend an event and that there are more likely to be a greater amount of returns on the event such as fund raising. \n\n### Option 1: ($50/13) - 10%\n\n### Option II: ($2,000/8) * 50%\n\n## The following 40", "answer": " 11"}

{"text": "### Instructions:Answer the following task.\n\n### Question:\n\nI have a bunch of gummy bears and I would like to fill up two 240-piece packets. How long would it be to fill 245 packets?\n\n### Demostration 1:\nGiven 300 gummies per minute, that's 5-minutes per two-piece packet.\nThis means if I have 300 gummi bears, then taking one out at a time, it takes me 150 seconds to fill each 240-gummy-bear-piece packet to a complete fullness, of which there is a total of 150 packets in all.\n\n### Response 1:\nThere are 50 gummy bear pieces inside one packet and a gummy factory produces 300 gums in a minute. Each minute 300 guns are produced. 300 gyms are produced every minute and there total 50 pieces inside each packet. This means that 6000 gummy beers can be produced in an hour.\n\n### Demo 2:\nEach 150 packets can be filled with 900 gummy bees in a minute. If we need to fill 243 gummy bears, with 245 total packets, then we have to add 3 extra packets. Now each one of these packets consist of 45 extra gummi-bears, which in other words are 45 gummy beers. The number of gummy bears needed in this case is 900 + 45 + 3 more, that is, 645 x 2, so 1360 additional gummy bears. Which means that it will take 2 hours to make 243 gummies.\n\n### Solution 2:\nUsing the method I gave, we need to add another 3 boxes to fill up 245 pieces, and this brings the number of gummy beans required to 960. In other words, we have 960 + 3 extra, which is 3 x 960 = 2880 gummy bears. This means that we have 24", "answer": " 40"}

There are 9 square feet in a rectangular space with 7 in each of the 2 dimensions.  And each of those is cut into 4 pieces for 36 squares, 9 of which measure 7 by 7 that cost $40 each, for a total of $360 in material and an additional $20 for making:  $380.

For each of the guests 21/25 people came to the party. To find how many invites were left to be attended to, we will put the total amount of guests so 21/20, or 1.1 to the power of 1.1. To further calculate the number of invites remaining, we take 20 to 21/2. To show how we would get this final result, we will go through several scenarios.\n\n### Answer: Option A \nWe take 20 and a 1/2. Here we have 21 invitations left to be accepted. That\u2019s 1.1 to 1.1, or 1. The number that each person invited would give around 1:17. Using a decimal approximation, we can say that there would be an average of 1.17 guests. This would be around 11 total. \nNext, we calculate the number of guests based on how many came for each guest.

B: Johnny practices the same amount of time everyday.\n3. C: Johnny has a lot of time of playing guitar left in the past.\n4. D: Johnny currently has half as much guitar practicing time as the current amount.\n5. E: How many days will pass for Johnny to do guitar practice 3 times as much as he is currently practicing?\n6. As of a day before the question, Johnny had half as much guitar practicum as currently, which means he had half as much guitar practice in that entire past day, and subtracting that half (which is half of the first number 20 days ago) by the current number for current guitar practice (whatever Johnny is currently practicing in [1] day past the day before the question), leaves you with [1] less the first half past time (which is half of half of one day of guitar practice in the past). In a nutshell: \"20 days ago, Johnny had half the guitar practicum that he currently has. How many days will pass so he'll have three times as much guitar practicum then what Johnny had 20 days before the question?\"\n7. To find Johnny's guitar practicum of 20 days before [the day before the question], you subtract 7.5 from [1]. Because Johnny has a lot of guitar practicum left in the past, you can't subtract 14.5 (half as much guitar practicum = half as much time = [a lot of guitar practicum])\n\n8. Since Johnny has a lot of practicum left, the answer should be 7.5 days if Johnny has [a lot of guitar times] left. In addition, you subtract 20 (1 day of guitar practicum = 20 days ago, 20 days before question) from 7.5.\n9. Since Johnny has half the time of guitar", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "There are 20 children in the class and $50 was raised. \nThe $50 was divided into $5 per student and subtracting the $50 leaves $50. \nMultiply this by two which is the number of students. \nIf each trip cost is $7, the total cost of the trip is 350, divided by the number of students (20) gives $18. \nAs $7 was subtracted from $18, we end up with $11 which is missing from the fund.\n\n#### Rationale: \n1. The question asks which money is missing in Miss Grayson' $11 field trip fund\n2. The first section of the question is to calculate $50 divided by 20= $2.50 which leaves $50.00\n\nThis is the amount left over after taking the money from the class, however the cost of the trip was $7 each student\n3. $50.05 divided by $7 gave $7.14, so $18 minus the $7.14 left $11\n\n#### Rationale 2\n\n1. The question reads, \"When is a 7 day period considered a week?\" The answer is in bold at the beginning of the question\n\n2.

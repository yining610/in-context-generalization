{"text": "1. The question is essentially asking how many pizzas Jim can make with the leftover flour.\n2. There are several ways to approach this problem. One common way is to start with the number of pizzas he can make with his initial 22kg of flour and deduct that from the total he needs to make to finish.\n3. Let's start with the assumption that he can make 22 pizzas with the 22kg. Using the known time he needs to make each pizza (10 mins) and the known weight each pizza needs (0.5kg), we can calculate how many he needs to make to be done with the 22. So, he'd need (22 kg)/0.5 kg (the weight of 1 pizza) x 10 min (his work time) = 44 pizzas.\n4. Now, we subtract this from the total he needs (22 kg) / 0.5 kg (weight of pizza) x 7 hrs (.5 kg/hour). To get the total he needs, we need to multiply this number by his daily allotment and then subtract the total he's already made. So, the total he can make is 22kg/(0.5/hr)/7 hrs = 7.4 pizzas. So, he can make 7 additional pizzes.\n5. Hence, we can conclude that the correct answer is 7: the number of pizzes he can make with the lemon left.\nSo the final is 7.\n\nInput:  Is it true that your house is too big for you?\nOutput:  The question is asking if the size of the house is an accurate reflection of the needs of the house's residents.

Let us call the square footage the value x, and the number of inhabitants by the variable y. We can write the equation representing this: y/x = 1.\n\nExample: We can use this equation graphically to see if the structure is appropriate for the needs of its residents.\nIf y/x = 0, then we can see that the number of people is equal to the amount of space and so the structure is too big for its actual needs", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "1. Kim's TV uses 330 watts.\n2. So the question is asking how this would impact the cost of running her TV.\n3. To find the cost per week, we need to multiply the cost by 5, which is equivalent to 4 hours a day for 5 days a week. In this case, we're asking for the cost after multiplying the cost per hour by the number of hours required to fully charge the TV in one week.  So, we can multiply 330 w/hour by  5 to get the cost in watts for the week.\n4. The question now becomes how much this will cost per week. So, to calculate the cost of running the TV, we need to take the total wattage cost for the week, and then multiple that by the electricity charge per watt that the TV used.\n5. Therefore, to find the cost of running the Tv for a week, we can find the total wattage that costs 33 cents per hour: 125 w* 33 cents/hour = 12.5 cents/hour.\n6. To calculate the cost of the TV running for a week, we multiply the wattage from step 5 by the total hours in one week (5 x 330 = 1650).\n7. So the final answer is 211 cents\n\nInput:A car traveled the same distance in 10 hours as traveling 10 times as much.

{"text": "1:So to solve this question we have to first find out how many years the piggy bank would take to be full, based on the amount Sheila was saving initially. So, after saving $3,00 on her first month, and $276 for 11*4 months, we are left with $1,304 as the amount of money Sheila had in her piggy bank and from this we also deduce that she would take 11 years to become wealthy enough to start funding her travel dreams.\n2:Now to figure out the final amount which will be Sheila's in her piggy at the end of 40 years, we add $3,00 from the first month, and add $1,303 for each of the next 40 months. So the new amount becomes:\n\\$ 3,000 + 40* (3,000)$3,000\nTherefore, her piggy will be filled up in 340 years (4*11+1) or $17,784*11+345 months, or 29.8 years. 340 years: 29.8 : 40 (days in 40 years)\n 3:This question also contains the information that her family, unknown to her has added \\$7,000 to her piggy on December 30th.

{"text": "8. In order to calculate the percentage chance of Anny getting into a serious accident, we first need to understand the relationship between temperature and skidding, as described in the question, where every 3 degrees the temperate goes above 32 degrees, the chance o skidding goes up by 5%. We then need to know the probability of skiding and the probability of regaining control given that a skid occurs, which is described in the last part of the question, where the skidding probability is 40% and the recovery probability is 60%.\n\nOnce we have that information, we can calculate the percentage chance of a serious accident by subtracting the probability of skidding from the total chance of a fatal accident:\n```\n\npercentage_of_serious_accident = 1 - (probability_of_skidding + probability_of_recovery)/2\n```\n\nWith that information, we can answer the question, given the information and assumptions in the problem, and the answer is 10%. Please see below for a more detailed explanation:\n1. To calculate the percentage chance of skidding, we first need to find the difference between the chances of skiddng given a certain temperature. This can be done by subtracting the chances of skidig given a specific temperature, starting from a temperature ot 32 degrees:\n```\n\nsubtract032(t) = {for example}\n```\n2. With that information, we then need to find the average percentage chance of skiddging given specific temperatures. This can be done using the formula: ```\n\naverage(subtract03-temp) =\n```3. With that information, given a temperature ot 8 degrees, we can then calculate the percentage chance of losing control, as follows:\n```\n\ncalculate_percentage_chance_to_skid (temp, probability_to_skid_in_general) =\n```\n\n4. To calculate the percentage chanse of an accident, we then need to understand the relationship of recovery after an accident:\n```\npercentage_of recovery =\n```\n\n5. With that, we can calculate the chance of a fatal accident as follows:\n```The\nfinal_accident_prob(temperature) =\n```\n6. Finally, our answer is as follows:", "answer": " 24"}

In mathematics, division is solving an expression or equation by breaking it down into smaller parts.\nIn this case, the question asks how long it takes to recover animals, which can be divided by the number of animals (3 + 2 = 5).\nThe answer is 6 hours, as the zoo will recover 2 animals in 1 hour and 5 animals in 1 hour.\n\nSo, the expression is 2/1+5/1 = 6/1 which equals 6.\n\n\n\n### Question:\n\nHow many of the given animals escaped? Choices: \n  A: lion  B: rhino  C: elephant  D: wolf  E: panther\n\nIf we take the original math question and apply it to the provided answer choices, we can determine the correct answer based on the following process:\n\nInput:3 animals and 2 animals\nOutput: If we assume that the three animals that escaped were one lion, one rhino, and one elephant, we can calculate the missing animal based on the question.\n\nIf it takes one hour to recover one animal, then three animals will need three hours to be recovered. Thus, the missing animal would need one hour in order to be recovered.\n\nThis leaves us with the following options: the wolf or the panther.\n\nWe can then look to the original question and determine which of these two animals was most likely to escape, given the given animals:\n\n3 lions and 1 rhino are escaping from the zoo. If it takes 24 hours to recover one animal, how long does the zoo spend recovering the animals?\n\nThe wolf and panther would both be unlikely to escape since they are not the two animals that would typically be associated with escaping from a zoo.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: elephant.\n\n### Question :\n\nHow much did the zookeeper pay for the elephant?

First, we will calculate the total cost of the eggs, using the information given in the question. We know that Tim bought 3 dozen eggs, and each egg costs $.50. So, the total cost of the 3 dozen eggs is $1.10.\n\n2. To determine the total cost of the order, we apply the PEMDAS order of operations to our problem:  _Parentheses and Exponents_ first, then _Multiplication and Division_, then _Addition and Subtraction_.\n   Since we're working with multiplication, we need to do that first. So, we have:\n  $3\\dot60 \\dot50 \\dot 4 = $180$ \\dot 4$.\n\n   This tells us that the total cost of the three dozen eggs is $3 \\times 60 \\times 50 \\times 4$, or $1,800$.\n3.

We know 20 x 3 = 60, so each additional day adds 60 to the total amount of practice.\n5) So, to get an answer of 360 (the amount of practice after 3 times the initial amount), multiply the previous answer by 3. We can do this because a) The practice amount was the basis for the initial answer and b) we have already worked out how to do it.\n6) Finally, to find out the number of days it will take, we have to subtract what we already know (20 days ago) from the amount of days we are trying to work out. The answer is: 605 (612 - 10 = 601, which when added to 12 produces 612 which is 605).\n7) Therefore, 605 days will pass before Johnny will have 3 times the amount of practice he currently has.\n8) We can combine the 5th and 6th bulletpoint and rewrite the question as:\n   Johnny practices for (5th point) 3 times the current amount and\n   in how many days can Johnny practice for 3 times what he currently does?\n9) In answer, then, I must multiply the 2 points above:\n\n 3 X\n\nAnswer (A) 50 days\n\nOutput: The correct answer is: 50.", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "1) First, let's clarify the specific number of games John is playing. If John plays in all the games his team plays, it's 20. (we can tell that John has played in at least 20 games by the phrase \"20%\").\n2) We already know that John's team plays 20 games in total (because John has played in 20 games himself). Thus, we can find the fraction of the games John played by dividing his number of games by the number of games played by the whole team. 20% is 20/100 = 2/10.\n3) Based on the scenario, we see that John gets fouled 5 - times - in a game. We also see that the number of free throws he gets depends on this foul count. If we multiply this by the number of games he played (20), we get 20 foul counts per game.\n4) Now the math becomes tricky. If John averages 70% success rate for free throws, the probability of getting a free throw is about 35%. On top of this, if he gets fouled twice in a game, the probability of getting another free throw is an additional 18%. When we multiply the probability of getting a second free throw by the number of possible chances (20), we achieve 360%.  If John plays 204 games, this probability increases to about 81%.\n\nA few math points:\nWe can represent P(x) as the probability of x. Probability is between 0 and 1.\nThe probability of one or more free throws equals P2 (2nd free throw). To get this probability, we multiply P by 2 (we can find the probability of one free throw and multiply it by 2).\nThe probability of one free throw equals P. The probability that we get one free throw equals\nthe probability that we get no - free - throws, which is 1 - probability that we get no free throws.\n\nFinal math point: The fraction of games John plays is 2/10 = 0.2. So, his probability of getting 1 foul in 1 game = 81/100 or 81%\n\nWe know the total number of 100 games per team. So, we can", "answer": " 112"}

However, to determine the amount of money that Jack and Tommy earned, we can simply subtract the amount Lisa earned to get final amount each one earned.\n- We can determine the amount Jack earns: 60-3-30=37(Jack earned $37).\n- We can determine Tommy's amount: 60-5-30=23(Tommy earned $23).\n*Now, to answer that last question we need to compare the amount each earned.\n* Lisa earned $30 more than Tommy($37-30). So, Lisa earned $30 dollars more than Tommy.\n\n**The next part of the question asks how much more did Lisa earn than Tom?\n3:The equation we need to use to answer this is equal to Lisa $37-Tommy's $23=Lisa earned $14 more than Tom\nAnd that is how you answer that\n\nInput: A truck carries two types of materials, wood panels and lumber.

We know Arnel had ten boxes of identical pencils, and he kept ten pencils for himself. This suggests that each box may have had an original total of 100 pencils, so each box would have 10 pencils in it originally (100 divided by 10=10). Since he kept 10 himself, that leaves a total of 90 pencils to be distributed. And since Arnel shared them equally, that leaves 18 pencils for each of his five friends.

{"text": "15 1/32 cubic feet of water\nExplain: The question is how many cubic feet are in the aquarium. This can be expressed in terms of cubic units and unit volume. The volume of the aquarium is determined by the length, width, and height of the container, so we know that it has a cuboid shape.\n\nA cubic unit is used widely in math, physics, and engineering to represent a unit of volume in space. It is defined as the volume of a cube having a side length equal to one unit. For example, in imperial units, a cubic unit is equal to 6 inches squared, and in metric units, it is equal to 1 meter squared.\nIn this example, we are dealing with a cubic unit that has a side length of 4 feet, which is equal to 54 inches.\nTo solve this formula, we apply the following equation:\n[ V = L*W*H ]\nIn this case, the aquarium length is 4 feet, the width is 6 feet, and the height, or depth, is 3 feet.\nWe can then rearrange the equation to represent the volume as follows:\n[ V = (4 * 6 * 3) cubic inches ]\n\nThus, the calculated volume of the aquarium in terms of cubic inches is 96 cubic inches.\nTo convert to cubic feet, we multiply the calculated volume by 1728 cubic inches per cubic foot.\nTherefore, we multiply 96 cubic units (cubic inches) by 1720 cubic feet per cubic unit (cubic inches), resulting in 16160 cubic feet, which is equivalent to 15 13/32 cubic foot units.", "answer": " 54"}

The following is what was given:\n  Winwin won $50.\n  She paid 20 percent of her winnings in tax.\n  She paid $5 in processing fees\nWe can calculate the winning amount using 5 different scenarios:\n\n  Scenario 0: WinWin did not pay any taxes or fees. So, this is 50 + 20 = 70.\n  Scenario 1: 50 in winnings + 0.2 * $50 in taxes = 50.\n  Scenrio 2: 50 in $50 + 0.5 * $50 in fees = 75.\n  Scenario number 3: 0 in winnings. 20% of 0 in tax is also 0, as is 5 in $50 in feess $50.\n\n  Scenario number four: 50 is the winnings, 1.2 is the taxes paid and zero is the amount of fees. So $0 is less than 50. 0.2 of the $50 is 10.00. 1.2 of $50 is 6.00.

So the two-digit number is 87\n\nChoice 1: Addition: the first digit of the two digit number is added to its second digit. So the second digit which was 8 now becomes 7 and the first digit 8 becomes 8+7 = 15.

We subtract the second digit which remains the same as the 7 to get the result 87-7= 80.\n\nChoice 3: Multiplication: The first digit of 87 is multiplied by 2. So the first digit 8 times 2 becomes 16. The second digit 7 becomes 14 and we multiply it to get 21. Now 16+21= 37 so the solution becomes 87 x 2 = 174\n\nChoice 4: Division: The first digit of two-digit number is divided by 2. So since 87 is a two digit number we need to subtract 0 for the remainder. So 87/2= 17 which equals the first digit 17.

The question asks, \u201cHow much gold do I have in my 40 ounce (40 oz.) jar with 3 ounces (3 oz.) taken out?\u201d\nIn this situation, you must first convert 3 ounces to the correct numerical value. For instance, ounces can be broken down into hundreds, teaspoons, and tablespoons; thus, when you have to solve such a problem, you may have to write fractions.\nYou can solve this equation by determining the difference between 40 ounces and 3 ounces, and then multiplying it by 3 ounces. We could represent this equation as:\n3 ounces(from a 40 ounce jar) \u2248 1/8 ounces + 28 ounces\nGiven the above, we know we need to take 3 ounces away from 40 ouncel, which comes to 36 ounces.

{"text": "1. We're given the amount Jake has, $5000, and we're told that he spends $28- on a motorcycle.\n2. From this, we can deduce that he has money left over after this purchase. Therefore, he does not buy the concert ticket. We also know that Jake spends half of his remaining money on the motorcycle, so he still has $10800 after this purchase. This means that after buying the motorcycle, he has $99600 remaining.\n3. Next, we know that Jake sp-ends 75% of his remaining money on a concert ticket, which means he has $26875 remaining after purchasing the concert ticket.\n4.

The Difference Engine, as it was called, was a calculator that used punch cards to solve mathematical problems.\nDespite its innovation, Babbage's invention did not prove to be practical for real-world applications, and it was never built to its full scale. \nThe real breakthrough in computer technology came with the invention of the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) in 1945 by John Atanasoff and Clifford Berry. ENIAC was the first electronic digital computer, and it was used during World War II to calculate artillery firing tables and ballistics trajectories.\nInput: In what city did Mozart die?\nOutput: Mozart died in 1791 in Vienna, Austria.\nInput: How do you spell tacos?\nOutput: 1) Look for clues in the question: the word \"tacos\" is often spelled \"tacos.\"\n2) Check the context: if the question is about tacos, it's more likely to be spelled \"tacos\" than anything else.\n3) Use common sense: if you're talking about tacos, they're more likely to be spelt", "answer": " 825"}

{"text": "1: Angie bought 3 lg. of coffee at the shop. Each lg. of coffee shall make about 40 cu. of coffee. Angie takes 3 cups of drinking every day. How many weeks will this coffee last her?.\n2: We shall start by working out the quantity of cups of coffee available. 3 lbs of coffee produce 4 times as many cups of coffee as 3 lbs of bread. So, 1 lb. of coffee produces approximately 40 cups. This indicates that 3 lbs. produces 120 cups of coffee as well.  Now, Angie drinks 40 cups each day. This means we require to divide the total quantity of cups of available coffee (120) by the number of days Angie drinks coffee. This indicates that Angie can have this coffee for 3 days. If her coffee supplies last her for 3 days, how many cups of coffee will she have left once she had used up three days worth of the coffee?.\n3: She'll have 40 cups left. 120 cu. is 3 times as much as 40 cups, which shows that 40 cups will suffice her for 3 days as well. 120/3 = 40.

How many weeks will it take her to use up all the remaining coffee?.\n4: We'll begin by determining how long she'll be using her coffee for. Since Angie drinks 60/4 cups of coffee each day, she takes 15 days to finish all the coffee. If she drinks coffee for 15 days, how long will she take to drink the remaining 40 cups?.  It is 30 days. So, she can brew a maximum of 30 days worth of coffee.  How long does she take to drink 30 days worth?.\n5: Each day, she'll consume 15 cups of coffee. Therefore it takes her a total of 15 days to drink 30 cups of coffee, as each cup last approximately 2 days. She takes 3 weeks to drink all the coffee she has got.", "answer": " 40"}

To arrive at the correct answer, we will need to calculate three different values: The number of motorcycles on the used car lot, the number of cars without a spare tire, and the total number of tires.\n4. Starting with the number of motorcycles, we can see that a third of the vehicles are actually motorcycles, so this would mean that there would be 8 motorcycles on the lot.\n5. Moving on to the number of cars without spare tires, we can see that 25% of the vehicles don't have a spare tire, which would mean that 6 cars don't have a tire.\n6. Finally, we have the total number of tire, which is the sum of all values together, which would be 14 tires (8 motorcycles with 2 tires each and 6 cars  with 1 tire each)\n\n7. Therefore, in conclusion, we would have 14 tires on a used car lot.\n\nInput: If you add three and two together, the correct result is 5.

{"text": "The question is asking Emily how many marbles she has after a series of transactions involving Megan. To find the answer, first let's analyze each transaction separately:\n   The first transaction: Emily has 6 marbels, and Megan gives her \"double the number she has\". This can be rewritten as \"Megan gives Emily 12 marbles\".\n   The second transaction: Emily has received 12 marbles, and she gives Megan back \"half of her new total plus one\". We can split this into two pieces:\n       First, \"half of her new [total]\";\n       Second, \"plus one\".\n   Let's start with the first part. To find \"half of [6]\", we can multiply by 0.5 to get 3. This is Emily's original total of 6 marbles, and it means she received 12 marbels plus an extra one from Megan's gift. So, to find \"half of her new totla\", we need the following:\n   $$x=6+12+1\\Rightarrow42/5=4\\Rightarrow x=4$$\nNow, we have \"half of her new tala of 4\", which is 2 marbles.\n   Next, let's focus on the second part: \"plus one\".

{"text": "So, this question is asking about the driving experience of James.\nIn order to answer this question, we need to use basic math and reasoning skills.\n\n1. First, we need to analyze the driving conditions and distance travelled.  The given information suggests that James drives at a constant speed of 30 mph (miles per hour) for half an hour and twice as far for twice the speed.\nThis means that he will travel for a total of 90 minutes and cover a total distance of 60 miles.\n2. Let us assume that the total distance is equal to 60 (since we only know it for half an hour). Then half an hour should give us 30 miles(if it was constant speed we would assume that in 60 minutes it should give us 60 miles). This information will help us come to a very simple formula:\nSpeed = Distance / Time (we need half an hour of travel time - 30 minutes)\n\n3. Now, we will apply our formula in this situation.\nSpeed = 60 mi/60min (the distance is unchanged but the time is reduced with half)\nSpeed = 1/1(the distance is unchanged and the time is increased to 60 minutes)\nSpeed = 6 mi/min (and since we know that the total driving time was 90 minutes and that is twice the distance - 60 miles, each minute must be twice the speed)\nSpeed = 3 mi/min\nOutput: 3 miles per minute\n\nInput: Which is the largest digit in the place value of 13,483?\n\nOutput: 3\nHere's how I got the answer: Let us break down the digits in the number so we can see where the digits are: In all the places on this number 13 is the highest so it would be the number in the ones place that is the biggest.The next place would be the tens so the number in the tens place is our second number. Then the place after we move up we move to hunderds so the number in the hunderds place of this is what's the most significant of our remaining five numbers.

{"text": "131. The first step in solving this problem is to convert all given measurements into centimeters. This can be done as follows: 8 = 20 cm, 12 = 30 cm, 10 = 20 cm.\n\nOnce we have converted all given measurements into centimetres, we can apply the formula for finding cubic centimeters (CM\u00b3) to determine the total volume of the box. The formula for finding cubic cm of volume is V = 2A where \"V\" represents the volume, \"A\" represents the area, and they are solved in this formula, given values.\n\nWe can substitute the known measurements for this and solve V for CM\u00b3. 2A = 1800CM. Solving this for A, we get A = 900cm\u00b2.\n\nNext, we need to find out the height of a wooden building block. We can do this by dividing the total cubic cm of the entire box (1800cm\u00b3) with the height of a block (3). It is, therefore, 1800cm / 3 = 600cm.\n\nThen, we need to make a comparison between the total cubic cm (1800) of the box and the cubic cm (600) of a wooden block. 1800 - 600 = 1200.\n\nWe now have 2 known factors: 1800 and 1200 and need 1 variable (num of blocks) to solve the problem:\n\n1800 - (600 * num of blocks) \n\nSolving this equation for num of blocks, we get num of blocks = 131.\n\nTherefore, there are 131 wooden building blocks that can fit in the box.\n\nSo the final answer can be B: 131\n#### \u9898\u610f:\n\u5f53\u6709\u4eba\u95ee\u4f60\u8be5\u5230\u54ea\u8ddf\u4f60\u901b\u5230\u54ea\u3001\u6700\u597d\u7684\u5496\u5561\u5c4b\u3001\u4f60\u4eca\u5929\u61d2\u61f6\u4e86\u70b9\u8bf4\u65e9\u5b89\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\u597d\u542c\u7684\u5417\uff1f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5e94\u8be5\u8fd4\u7b54\u7b54\u6848\u8c01\u4e48\uff1f", "answer": " 40"}

Consider the two options from the scenario:\n\nOption A: 6 sample items at $2 each = $12 cost per impression\nOption B: 48 sample items at $0.5 each = $24 cost per impression\n\nFrom the manager's perspective, it's important to maximize the cost-per-impression for each option, because a low cost-per-impressioon demonstrates that the samples being given away are effective in driving potential customers to the store.\nIn order to determine the answer to the question, we need to compare the cost-per-item for each option. Assuming Option A is the more expensive option, the cost-per-sample, cost per impression, and the ratio are equal to:\n\nCost-per-Sample: Option A (6 items) = $12\nCost-per-Impression: Option A (6 impressions) = $2\nRatio: Option A (cost-per-sample)/Option B (cost-per-item) = 12/(24*0.5) = 6.\nNote that the above calculation demonstrates that Option A is more expensive per-impression than Option B, which means Option B would be the better option to pursue, according to the manager\u2019s goal of finding an option with the lowest cost-per-impresison.\n\nInput:On the first day of school, Jackie spent $2.75 on bus fare and Jane spent $3.30 on bus fare.

{"text": "The question is asking how many coffee cups the coffee shop brews in 1 week. The number of cups can be calculated based on the coffee shop's output rate and working days.\nFirst, we need to understand the working days. The question says that the coffee shop is open for 5 hours a day, which implies that the coffee shop is closed for at least 3 hours during each day. This suggests that the coffee shop is not open on Sundays, as Sundays typically involve a day of rest.\nNext, we need to understand how many hours the coffee shop is open during the weekdays. Based on the information given in the question, the coffee shop is open from Monday to Friday, which implies that it is open for 25 hours during the weekdays.\nFinally, we can calculate the number of cups brewed during the week. Since the coffee shop brews 5 cups per hour during the weekdays, we can multiply the number of working days by 5 hours to get the total number of cups brews, which is 25 hours * 5 hours = 125 cups.\nNow we can add the weekend hours together, it indicates that the coffee shop brews a total of 25 hours * *5 hours for a total of 125 coffee cups per day and then multiply that by the number of days it's open, which is four days. The final answer is 4 days * 125 = 500 cups.\n\nInput: A bicycle can travel 150 m in 50 min, at a constant speed.

So we have to start by noting that the answer is 10 feet, which is the distance from the flagpole's tip to the ground. In other words, the tip of the flag pole has been lowered 10 feet.\n\nTo determine the length of the flagpole, we can subtract 10 from the flagpole' length of 12.

How many employees were fully or part time workers?\nOutput:1. To answer this question, we have to focus on the first sentence, as it gives the information needed to answer the question. We need to find out how many employees are full or part time workers.\n\n2. We can determine this by subtracting the numbers of part time and full time employees together from the combined total of those who wanted a new job. As a result, this will tell us how many were either part time or full time employees.\n\n3. So, we can say that 2/3 of the total number of employees were part-time workers, and the other 2/3 were full-time employees. Let\u2019s do some computations, we have to multiply two-thirds by 18 (total number of employees).We can see that 2/3 * 18 = 12.

We can look at this formula more specifically: TotalNumberOfMembers = initialNumber*2. This is because there are two times as\nmany female members as male members in the club. So, if we multiply\nour initial number, which is 18, by 2, we get 36. We then subtract 18 to get the total number of female members.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "The solution is B. To answer this question, we need to look at the number of cards for each person and figure out how many cards each person should add to their collection to have a total of 99 cards.\n   First, let's look at the information given. Mark has 3x as many cards as Lloyd, but he still has fewer cards than Michael. This means Mark has less cards than both Lloyd and Michael.\n   Next, let's consider the situation. Michael, Lloyd, and Mark all have 90 cards, and they want to have 100 cards each. This means they each need to add 10 more cards to their collection to reach the goal.\n   Finally, let's look for the answer. To answer the question, let's do some math. The sum of 3x (the number given) and 1 (for Lloyd) is 10 for Mark. Now, subtract 10 from this value and multiply it by 2 (the value we multiplied by to get the number of cards for Mark) to get 20. This is the number of extra cards Mark needs to add to his collection to reach 100 in his collection. Similarly, Lloyd needs 1 card, and Michael needs 20 cardsto reach 99 cards. So, this means the number of extra cards each person needs to add to their collection is 20, 1, and 20, respectively.\n   Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n\nInput:You are given 5 marbles, 4 beads and 3 pebbles.

{"text": "This is a pretty simple question that will help us identify the answer.\nLet's review:\n1. To enter the correct answer, the bear gained a little over 200 pounds from eating small animals.\n2. First, let's figure out how much it gained:\n3. It gained a fifth (20%) of the weight it needed to get to 1000, at the start of summer.\n4. That number of pounds:   200\n5. Next, let's figure how much it gained from acorns:\n6. It gained twice what it gained from berries, during summer, for a total of 400 pounds.\n7. Next, it gained 50% of the remaining weight, or 100 pounds.\n8. Finally, it gained 200 pounds while eating small animals. So the bear gained **200 + 400 + 100 + 25 = 925 pounds** during eating small animals. In this question, we are looking for small animals.\n9. At the end of the summer, the bear needed to gain 10% of its weight, or 170 pounds to get to 1100 pounds. The bear needed to gain 200 pounds on top to get to 1300 pounds.\n10. Now let me add these two numbers together and subtract. So 1050-170=880. So the bear gained only 880 pounds.\n\nSo the final answer, in pounds, is \n925 -880 = 45 pounds\n\nInput: You have a problem.

We know that Borris uses 90 kg per 6 months, but he thinks of increasing it to 20% which means that he needs to make up 20% more. This means that to match the 20% increase in B's thinking, he should multiply it by 1.2 for the output in the year (20% * 1.2). B: This is not the right answer. The right answer is C. What Borris should do after he thinks of increasing the production is to multiply the output by 1.2 (20% *1.2). We'll call his thought after increasing production as A (a). C: This is the final answer. Borris could try to make an output by multiplying his thinking (A * 1.2) to match 20% of his thinking.\nSo Borris needs 20% more of a year's output to match the 25% output required by A.

How much ground does a football team cover in a game?\nOutput: One quarter of a basketball field is 25.2 meters, so to solve this problem, you'll need to determine the amount of ground a football team travels in a game and convert the area from metric to English units.\nA quarter of a football field measures 20 meters (yds), so that gives us a total area of 40 (yds).\nA football game lasts 1 hour, which means that 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes, making 1 game equal to 60 minutes.\nTherefore, you can convert the game time to the number of meters, which is 6000 (m).\nA football field is 1 football diamond, which equals 12 yards, so a full football field is equivalent to 120 (yds). Since a football game lasts for 60 minutes, the area covered by a football team in a game equals 6000 / 120, or 50 yards (yds).\nYou can calculate the square footage by multiplying 25 (yds) x 25, which gives you a total of 625 square feet.\nInput: To convert radians to degrees, you must multiply the number of radians by 180.\n\nOutput: To convert radians into degrees, multiply the radians by 1.

What's the smallest positive one that I can find?\nOutput:  The question is about finding the smallest positive number in a set of numbers.\nTo solve, first, we can list all the numbers in the set, including the negative ones, as well as divide them into two categories: the positive and negative ones. The positive numbers are the ones that we are looking for.\nTo choose the smallest positive number, we cannot directly rely on numbers below 1, since this would affect its value. Instead, we can choose a random number in the set to get a base for our calculation.\nTo determine the smallest positive number, it is helpful to think about the difference between the minimum and maximum numbers in the set. This difference tells us if any of the negative numbers are less than all of the positive numbers, or if all of the positive numbers are less than any of the negative ones.\nIf only some of the positive numbers are greater than all of the negative ones, then it is possible that the smallest positive number could be any number larger than this difference, such as the midpoint or something of that nature.\nOn the other hand, if all of the positive\nnumbers are less than any of them, then we can start by subtracting the largest negative number from all of the positive numbers and then take the smallest number left of all", "answer": " 2"}

The remaining $8 would be split up evenly, and each remaining person would pay $1 to the group. Since each remaining person has an initial cost of $8, this would increase their cost to a total of $18 each. So the total cost for all 6 people would be $118.\nThis is clearly not the answer, since $118 + $40 is not $46.20 (give or take rounding.)  A is the wrong option.\n\n### B:\nIf the gift was B, each person would pay $8 more for a total of $56, which is incorrect. \nB is the wrong option. \n\n### C:\nIf the gift is C, then each person's share of the total cost would be $44. Each person would pay an additional $8 to get the total sum of $52. Again, this option is incorrect.\n\n### D:\nIf the gift were D, the total cost would $76 each.

So we can assume that the taut line is only moderately strong.\nTo determine how much force it takes to slacken the line, let\u2019s say that there is a force of 10 pounds per foot of line. If the dog moves 5 feet side", "answer": " 250"}

{"text": "We are given information about the volume of liquid in the hot tub and the number of bottles of champagne. To answer this question, we need to determine how many bottles of champagne to fill the hot tub and the cost of doing so.\n\nThe hot tub holds 4 times as much liquid as a single bottle of champagne, so we also need to convert the number of bottles from quarts to gallons to determine how much liquid is needed.\n\nFirst, consider the relationship between quarts and gallons. There are 4 quarts in a gallon, so that the number of gallons in a quart is 4 / 4 = 1. Therefore, one quart is equal to a quarter of a gallon, or 1 / 4 gal. Finally, we also need to convert 1 quart to cubic inches, as we now know the amount of liquid needed. In general, there are 231 cubic inches in a quart. Therefore, we need to apply 4 / 4 to this formula and get (1 / 4) \u00d7 (231 /4) to get the result of 57.\n\nTherefore, we have 40 gallons / quarts of champagne in the hot tub, so the volume of the hot tub is equal to 40 gallon/ 1 quart = 40 gal / 4 = 40 gal x 4 = 160 quart, and the volume of champagne in the tub is equal to 160 quarts x 1 quart = 160 quart/ 4 = 47 quart.\n\nSince we have 40 gal, which is 160 quart to fill a hot tub and since each bottle is quarter gallons, we need 160 quart / 4 = 57 quart, which is 47 bottles to fill the hot tub.\n\nFrom this, the answer to the question is $650.00, as $50 x 47 bottles of champagne is $50 x quantity 57. This is equivalent to $10/bottle, as the quantity of 57 is equivalent to $650.\n\nInput:What is $100 - $14? Choice 1: $133.41 (A) Choice 2:", "answer": " 6400"}

You are now going 10 MPH less than when the brake was applied. What is the average deceleration during the 10 MPH? [Please note that this is a multiple choice question]\nOutput: Question: Deceleration is the rate of change of speed, so we are looking for the average rate at which the car was decelerating during the 10 mph slowdown. The average deceleration is the rate at which the speed was reduced over time, calculated by dividing the total distance traveled (10 mi) by the total time spent traveling (the time from when brakes were applied until car slowed to 10 mph). Calculating the average deceleration is expressed in feet per second squared (f/s\u00b2), which is the average of how much the car decelerated each second during the 10 mile trip.\nTherefore, to determine this factor's value, we need to know two things:\n\nDeceleration is the rate the speed is reducing.\nDeceleration is expressed in f/s\u00b2. This factor can be calculated using this formula:\n\nDecelerate =(10mi) / (time*10)\n\nBased on the equation, the average deceleration can be calculated as follows\nFraction = Decelerate  / Decelerate\nFraction = 10 / time*10 or\n   Factor = time  *10 / Decelerate\n\nIn our example, suppose car slows down from 60 mph to 50 mph.\n   Deceleration = 6", "answer": " 20"}

The answer is 6,000, as a teacher who teaches 5 periods per day and works 28 days a month (28 * 5 = 1\u00d7100 = 500) would earn a total of 550 per week (5\u00d7500), and 15,500 per year 15,583 (550x28).

However, this method doesn't account for different sizes, and it only considers the addition or subtraction of one shoe size. It's not a good approach for this type of solution.\n3. An alternative method is to calculate a factor, such as 2, and multiply the result by the smaller shoe size, as shown below: Jasmine's size is 7. We multiply this by 2, which is the factor: 2 * 7 = 14\n4. Alexa's size, or the second number in the equation, is 14, so we add that result to the product of the factor and the first number:\n14 + (2 * 7) = 28\n5. So, the combined shoe size is 28.

The question asks us to determine the original number based on a mathematical relationship between 1/3 of that number and 5/10 2/3 of the original number.\n2. Let\u2019s work through the relationship:\n   If 1/3 of some number is 5/2/3 of 2/3 of that number, then what\u2019s the original number?\n   Divide both sides by 3 to isolate 1/3:\n      5/3 = 2/3 * (1/3)\n   So:\n      5/10 * 2/3 = 1/3\n      10/27 = 1/3 * 3\n      10 = 3 * 1/3\n\n3. Therefore, since 10 is equal to 3 * 1 /3, the original number must be equal to 3 *1 /3, or 33/3.

The units for the answers should be \"cents\".\nOutput: So James needs to pay $5.50 if he has 130 cm of fabric. \nTo find the answer, we must first identify the correct formula. We can solve this mathematically by taking the steps below.\n1. We can determine the cost of 1 cm of fabric. James has 110 cm of fabric already, so we multiply 110 by 0.80 to find the total cost. This comes out to $92.\n2. We need the cost of 6 cm of fabric. This is 0.5 times 110 cm. The formula is 0.5 * (110cm), or 0.5 * 110. This equals 55 cm.\n3. The next step is to find the answer, which requires multiplying each part. This gives us 55 times 80, which equals 4400. \nFinally, the answer is 4400 cents.

This means that we need to find the total amount Bobby paid for the shoes.\n3: Let's break down the cost and start with the first charge, which is $250 to create the mold.  The customer decides to pay the full $250 since they want the shoes made from the mold.  So, the first charge is $250.\n4: Next, we need to find the cost for each of the hours the cobbler works on the shoes.  Since Bobby is charged 80% of $75 for each hour, we know that each hour costs $60.  So, to find the total cost for each hour, we multiply $75 by 80/100, which gives us $60.\n5. Next, we need to add up the cost of each hour to find the total cost of the shoes.  To do this, we add the $250 we paid for creating the mold and each of the $60 costs for each hour worked on the shoes.\n6. Since there are 8 total hours worked, this gives us a total cost of $2100.

{"text": "1.The question refers to two friends who are climbing a telephone poll and asks about the difference in their height after 7 minutes of climbing.\n2.The first thing to notice is that Matt's speed is 6 feet per minute and Jason's speed is 12 feet per second. This tells us that Matt will climb up the telephone pole at a rate of 6 feet per minute, while Jason will climb at a rate of 12 feet per hour.\n3.To answer the question, we need to find out how much higher Jason will be than Matt after 7 minutes of them climbing at their respective rates. In other words, we want to find out the 7th coordinate in our two dimensional coordinate plane.\nTo do this, we can first set up a 2x2 matrix:\nmatrix <- cbind(c(jason's initial position, matt's initial position), c(1/60, 1/60))\nwhich tells us that Jason is at (0, 0), and Matt is at (100, 0).\n4.Next, we need to calculate how high Matt has climbed in 7 minutes. To do this, we can multiply the first coordinate in the matrix (in our case, Jason's position) by the coefficient associated with the time, which in this case would be 60/60, which is 1.\nmatrix[1, 1] = c(0, 0)\nmatrix[2, 1] = 1\n5. Finally, we can use the same formula we used for Matt to calculate the difference in height between Jason and Matt by calculating the second coordinate in the matrix (Matt's position) at any given time since they began climbing. So we use matrix[2, 2] since that is Jason's position relative to where Matt was initially.\nmatrix[2,2] = c(12*(60/60), 12*(60+t)/60)\n6.To answer the question of how high Jason will be after 7 minutes, we can compare the fifth coordinate in the matrix (their final position) to determine their combined height.\nmatrix[5, 5] = (matrix[2, 2]) + (matrix[2,1])\nmatrix[5,5] = 1", "answer": " 42"}

The number of bananas collected by each pile of monkeys was 496 while the remaining piles held 360 bananas.\n\nThe final sentence of the question provides the solution. By dividing the number of bananas collected equally by each pile of bananas, 6 piles received 256 bananas each and the remaining 6 piles received only 234 bananas each.\nFurther analysis of the context provided in this question states that each hand held 14 bananas.

Each of four possible moves makes no more than 3 squares a side.  How many possible paths exist?\nOutput: The given table is a matrix of moves. To solve this problem, we need to find all possible paths from one position to another. A path is a sequence of moves that always results in the final position. There are 5 options to enter a given position; hence there are 5 options in our matrix. As moves can only be made a certain number of times in a straight line, all straight paths have a certain number of steps, which are represented by the numbers in each of these. The squares marked 1, 2 and 3 are not on a straight line, so there are no additional paths. For paths that pass through squares marked 4 are the first and last squares on either side of the path, and therefore cannot change. Therefore the remaining paths form a pattern of squares 5 in the following image. The number of paths from each starting square to reach ending square are marked on each path.", "answer": " 5"}

So, 30% of 100 equals 30, and 100 divided by 30 equals 3. So, the answer is 3 times 100, or 300 people.\n  To find how many people have type B blood, we first multiply 45 by 100 and then divide by 100. So, we multiply 45 by a number that equals the total percentage of the entire group. 100, so 45 * 100 equals a number larger than 45, but multiplying by a total percentage allows us to divide that number by 100 after subtracting 45, and so, 45 * 35 equals 11 (45 * 5 = 225, subtraction 45 = 170, 170 * 100 = 17,000, and 17,050 - 45 = 679, which is 11). So, 45 * (100 - 45) equals 11, and then we divide this answer by 100 to get our answer. So, 11 divided by 100 equals.11..11 multiplied by 100 is.11 times 100 equals exactly 11. So, our answer is 11.

The woman is two times wider than the boy, meaning the woman is 6 feet wide and the boy is 3 feet wide.\\\n3. The diameter of each person's face is proportional to their height and width, so the diameter of the woman's face is 3 times her height (3 feet) and the diameter of the boy's face is 2 times his height (2 feet).\n4. To calculate the height of each person, we can divide their diameter by 2 and then subtract 1:\n\nwoman's height = 3/2 - 1 = 2 ft 9 in\nboy's height = 2/2 - 1  =  1 ft 1 in.\n\nSo, the final answer is that the woman is 2 feet 9 inches tall and the boy is one foot one inch tall.", "answer": " 319"}

From the question, we know that there are 40 red candles, fewer than 3 times the number of yellow candies (20), and half as many blue candy as yellow candies (10).\n   B: We also know that Carlos ate all of those yellow candies.  So, we can say that out of the 20 yellow candies, 22 are left (20 were eaten and 2 remains).  This leaves us with fewer than 3 times as many candies remaining, which is equivalent to 2 (9 - (3 X 22)).

Therefore as 1 pound of total flour needed, which means we can use 1 pound as ratio 1:4.5 with our remaining flour. Now we take flour in 1 pound and divide by our fraction 1:4.45, therefore 1/4.45 = 0.2222...", "answer": " 1200"}
{"text": "The question is asking for the sister's age based on a previous mathematical expression.\n\n1. Let's start with the initial premise. The expression \"Djibo's age 5 years ago + Djibo's age\" = \"35\" - we can simplify this by subtracting the second term from the first to get \"Djibo\" 5 years ago = 35 - Djibo's current age.\n2. Therefore, we can use this expression to determine the sister's age. Since we know Djibo is 12 years older than his sister, we can substitute in the values and solve for her age. This gives us that his sister is 23 years old today.\n3. Therefore, the final answer is that Djibo's younger sister is 23.", "answer": " 28"}

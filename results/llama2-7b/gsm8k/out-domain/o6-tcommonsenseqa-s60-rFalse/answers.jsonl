We use variables to represent unknown numbers, and often times, unknown objects or sets of objects. If you remember when we went over arithmetic, one of the biggest components of having that knowledge was to be able to represent a number in different ways. You learned in the chapter that a number can be expressed in different ways but they all represent the same number. The same idea can be extended to how we use variables in math. There are many ways a variable might be written, but they all represent the number.\n\n\n\n###### Question\n\n```\nA variable is an object or set of objects that are used to represent unknown numbers. \n\n**In which type of plant does is it not possible to move one part?

Bird, E Nothing\nAnswer:\n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the same grade math question using C++ or Python\n\n1. Incorrectly use the wrong variable type or value\n   It is important to choose an appropriate type of variable for a particular task and to use the correct value types when assigning values. Variables may be different types (integer, floating-point, bool, string), and they may have different size, precision and representation on some platforms.\n   In C++ we have different type of variables : double for floating point variables, long for integer variables, int for int and char for character variables like alphabets \"a\".\n```\nint iVariable;\nint jVariable = 55;\nfloat fNumber = 2.34356f; // not necessary to put f at the end of number when we are trying to get a floating variables from the user\ncout << \"value of i: \";\ncout << iVariable << endl;                                                                                \ncout << \"value f of i: \";\ncin >> iVariable;\ncout << \"value j of i: \";\nfor (int i = 0; i < iVariable; i++)\n   cout << iVariable << \" \";                                                                                   \ncout << \"value i of i: \";\niVariable = 99;\ncout << iVariable;\ncout<<iVariable;\ncout<<float(iVariable);\n```\n\n1. Do not initialize variables\n   It is important that variables are assigned a value when they are declared. Variables that are never assigned a value may be set to default values (e.g., uninitialized values) but they are not guaranteed values, and the result is unpredictable.\n   When you use variables you have to initialize then with a value when you declare them.\n```\nint iValue;                                                                  \nint jValue = 10;                                  \nint kValue;\n\n```\n1. Pass the wrong type of variable to functions\n   Functions and methods require specific inputs.\n   We have to understand", "answer": " 28"}

You can achieve this in multiple ways.\n\nFor example, in the second and third questions, a different syntax could have achieved the same answer (respectively `input: If A and B` or `input: input: If A and B`)\n\n### Function: input: Is A or B\n\nReturn a bool. Either A or B, but never both.\n\nExamples:\n`true`\n`false`\n\n### Function : input: Is A, B, and C\n\nReturn a bool indicating if any of the three are true. They may be true at exactly the same time.\n\nExample:\n`true` `true` `false`\n\nExample:\nIf I make 1, the boolean will always return `false`\nIf I make 2, the boolean will always not return `false`.\n\nExamples: \n`true` `false` `false`\n`false` `false` `true`\n\n### Solution: (Use the Is Any function as your building block)\n\n```\ndef isAny(input, options):\n    if any([input == option[0].strip() for option in options]):\n        return True\n    return False\n```\n\n### Instruction\nThere are 2 variables, the first one in the function is the input. This input value should be a list with many values that need to be checked to see if they are either of the list of values in the second function parameter. The list to be compare against the input list element should be a list of lists with 2 values in each list. Examples:\n\nA solution using the input: Is Any with Is A: (First list is the options the second is the inputs in the list)\n```\ndef isA(options):\n    options[0] = option.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "B: \n\nInput: You enter a number n. Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n (which includes 1 - divide down), and multiply this GCD by a factor of 2. How is this factor chosen? Why is this effective?\nAnswer: We are given the greatest divisor function div(n). If we divide down by GCD(n), it will leave a remainder n/GCD(n). We then multiply this by a factor of 1/2 (to halve the remainder) and then repeat the procedure again. This is effective because it guarantees that the remainder is 0 after multiple divisions.\n\nInput: You are given an empty set. Find every two consecutive numbers in the set of integers so that their sum is the provided number. How would you achieve this?\nAnswer: We start by creating a loop of length n+1.

{"text": "Answer: yasna will read 75 pages each day to finish both of the book. A two-week period is equal to 72 hours. The first book is 18 pages long. The second book is 50 pages long. There are two ways to look at the problem. One way is that the days can be broken down into sets of 24 pages. The second way is that the days are equal so there will be 1440 minutes which divides equally into 180 pages. Since the 180 pages will be read every 24 hours, this equates to every eight hours or every two days, there will be 180/24 = 7.5 pages to read. Once one of the books is done, we have 100 pages left. The answer is 7.5 pages/2 = 3.75 pages. The second option for solving the problem is to realize that there are only two books and 1440/2 = 720 minutes. That means that each book is 8.5 pages. The third option is to look at the last page of book one and compare the answer to the next book (last page) so that the answer can be compared with each book. This will lead to the book being read in increments of the last page divided by 8.5 so that at the end, the final page will contain the required 1440 total minutes divided by pages so that the total is 8 pages. The math to determine the answer in one book is 3.75 * 24 + 2.75 * 8.5 pages to finish either book. Both options are equal.

Packs of each type of candy cost $2.50, packs of mixed types cost $2.25, and individual bags of mixed types cost $1.75.  The company is offering a discount to customers who buy enough candy to reach a certain sale threshold.  If a customer buys a quantity of mixed types that is a multiple of five, the sale threshold for each type is decreased by $0.50.

There are some tricky operations to include subtraction and division with fractions. Subtraction is more tricky, but if you take positive fractions, such as 1/2 - 1/2 = 0, and then the same with integers (3 - 3 = 0 because integers can be thought of as fractions with no denominator). You can also subtract negatives from negatives, and positive integers from negative integers to get the answer as a negative. Also, to work out a negative fraction such as (-4/2) you subtract the positive 2 and leave the answer as a negative, because if you were to reduce a -4/2 you get -8/4 and that's not positive.\n\n\n### Grade Math Homework Question (Solution on next page)...\n\n**Input:**\n\nThe teacher didn't just wnat the answer and work shown...\n\n **A:**\n\n **B:**\n\n **C:**\n\n **D:**\n\n **E:**\n\n    return \"Input: Where did the ol...\";\n\n    return \"Where would you find a...\";\n\n    double vase_value = 10;\n\n    while (true) {\n        System.out.println(\"Option 1 - A\");\n        System.out\n           .println(\"Option 2 - B\");\n        System.print(\"Option 3 - C\");\n        System.println(\"Option 4 - D\");\n        System.printf(\"Option 5 - E\");\n        vase_value = vase_value + System.in.read()\n               .charAt(0) - 'A';\n        if (vase_value > 0) {\n            return \"Input: The astronau...\";\n        } else {\n            return \"where you would f...\";\n        }", "answer": " 22"}

You should find or learn a programming language, and solve it in that language. The question that you try to answer with pen and paper is not a question. You need to do some more thinking before you can answer it. The fact that this is a math stackexchange does not mean that your question is a mathematical question. It is a task you should do by yourself, then come and ask when you find something difficult, or if you found a mathematical question in the process.\n\nYou are asking some question that is unclear. I would suggest that you write down your thought process in your question. It is very hard to understand the problem, if you tell me the question you ask yourself, what you think, rather than tell me what the instruction/task actually is.\n\nComment: I don't know the context, but it doesn't seem like a programming homework, as the questions clearly refer to school age students.\n\nComment: Yes, it's a grade 12 math school project.\n\nComment: The link was to a sheet with all of the questions and answers.

{"text": "69.5\n\nInput: \t\nOutput: \n```\n\n### Python Instruction:\nFor this assignment you will want to use multiple helper functions to answer the multiple grade math questions (the ones that aren't one line math questions).\nYou will get:\n\t*A string representing the question\n\t*A string containing the answer to the question\n\t*An int containing the number of characters of the question (not counting the final newline character)\n\t*A string of characters representing the helper functions you are going to be using\n\t*Any other arguments/variables that the function takes as parameters\n\t*The return value of the helper function\nWhen you are done writing your helper function just call it as many times as the number of helper functions you have and make sure to call the correct ones. This allows you to do two things:\n\t*You only call helper functions where they are needed, not all the time (for things that are obviously one line of code)\n\t*The parameters/return values are passed to the correct function (so you don't do math on the question)\n\nFor example, say you have the following:\n```\nprint(\"Input: What is 7 in Japanese?\")\n#helper function\ndef multipleQuestion(answer, question):\n\treturn answer\n\t#helper function\ndef oneLineQuestion(answer, question, newline):\n\tif question.lstrip().__len__() == 1:\n\t\treturn answer\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n\n\tquestion = input()\n\tanswer = multipleQuestion(9,\"question\")\n\n\t#You could instead just do the one-line version and not worry about helper functions and variables and params if need be\n\t#print(\"Input: The cake is a lie\")\n\t#answer = 9\n```\n\nThe idea here would be to have the one-line version of the helper function be able to answer simple questions (questions which will only be 0-9 or a period), but in the process of answering them, convert it to the full-line version of the same function. This way you can get both answers to the same question even though you'd normally only expect a single answer. This allows you to answer questions which you can answer easily with a quick line of code, but then also have a full-featured parser.", "answer": " 52"}

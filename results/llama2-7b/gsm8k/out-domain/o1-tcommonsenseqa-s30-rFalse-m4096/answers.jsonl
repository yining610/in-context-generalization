The data was collected using a simple observation method, whereby a person was classified as walking their dog if they held the leash, the dog was wearing a collar, the dog was on the leash, it was a recognised breed of dog, it had a name, was younger than 10 years old and had four legs (the breed did not matter). The data set was then analysed in order to identify all of the possible errors that could have occurred if the incorrect or unrepresentative sample were chosen. To start with, there were two sources of error whereby either the dogs or their owners could have had the same error. The researcher\u2019s hypothesis was that there would be no dogs, where a person did not have a dog but held the leash of one. When the researcher plotted the data on a bar graph which showed the percentage of owners (as a proportion of all owners) who did not have a dog, there was no value of zero. A closer examination of the data showed that there was no error in the sample collection method. What were the potential errors for this data set? Choices", "answer": " 14"}

{"idx": 464, "text": "D: The answer is 7.5; we know that 1 batch can make 3 and 1 batch makes 3, and we know that 2 can go in the oven at a time, which means we need 2 x batches to get 6 in the oven at once, so we multiply by 2, and 3 batches makes 6, and we go to the next batch and see if we make 2, which is a yes. After we do this we are left with 3 making 6. We multiply 3 batches by 3 pizzas per batch and we are left with 9. We add 6 and we have 15. After we add 12 we realize we are left with 2.5 and half pizzas will go over in what the oven can make, so we have the answer of 2.5; 30 minutes in 30 minutes, so 30 minutes to get 36 and Camilla can only make 12, so 7.5 hours it takes to make 12 pizz\nInput:How many kilograms of rice are there in 120 liters of rice?\nOutput:D: The answer is 25.8 kilograms; we know that 4 liters of rice make a kilo of rice, so we multiply 4k x 30, and we know that there are 120 litres of rice, but we know that 30 is more than 120, so we take 120-23 and add 23 to the power of the number of litres so 120-30=90 and 120-90=30. By doing so we get an answer of 30. We take 30/4 and we get 7.5 litres and we subtract that from 120 litre and we get 120-7.5, and we subtract 7.5 from 120, and we get 115.75 and divide 115 by 30 and we get 3.85 and add 30 to the power of 3.8, and 3 is more than 0 but less than 4, so we put 3 to the power of of 3.8", "answer": " 5"}

So, the average speed must be the same as the change or difference between the average speeds.  The change is -x*x2 = -xx2x13.  Therefore x (x2-1)= - x  13.

The total bill was $49 for the bread, but the total bill was 140 USD; since 16% was taken off the bill, you have to divide the original charge by.16 to find the new charge.

On the day of the exam, the results of the lab were put on a slide for the students to analyze as a study guide. The students used the study material and were able to complete most of the questions on the lab \n exam. The most important topics, the ones they studied the most, were the ones which were covered the most on the exam. The class averages was a 49/100 with a standard deviation of 5. For the past few months the \n students have been studying more about the topic which affects the earth and nature the most. They've been doing a lot of homework and going to biology class which has helped improve students' knowledge of \n subjects as the semester passed. Most of the students' tests were in the form of a multiple choice answer or a True/False question, which doesn't require a lot of analysis of how to solve the problem or to know \n the background of all of the concepts that are covered in science. Studying the topics and answering several questions about those topics can help you understand and appreciate the topic better. For the most \n important subjects, like chemistry or biology, students should have a basic knowledge of the topics and be able to answer most questions on exams. The students will learn how to become better in science by \n making it their priority and keeping study time organized and efficient.\n\nBecause the students know about science, it is because they know that it is important for their future success and they are willing to study hard. Also students who are willing to study science well usually understands and appreciates that what they learn in the classroom can help them be successful in their careers, in life, and with their future families, etc. The students also know that if the do not do well in science or any other subjects, it will affect them and make it harder for them to succeed in life and will increase how likely it is for them to fail and have a disadvantage in life.\n```\n\nInput: A 23x2 matrix is a23x2 matrix, so the input is", "answer": " 15"}

In the first problem statement, it says the scientist began analying (sic) the data because he wanted. It was the correct question, and we can see it in problem statement. However, in the question options, all answers start with the same phrase \"to learn more about\", which we can choose one that contains the same phrase as \"the scientist began analging the data because he wanted\". So, we have `better understanding`as the correct answer for this problem.\n\n- For the second problem, we can observe the problem sentence: \"The scientist found out that the number of ants double itself every hour. He got interested in the effect of temperature on ants, and began to do calculations. (Notice the typo of ant.) The scientist decided to investigate the question: how many ants will be present after 5 hours if the number of them doubles itself over each 1 hours. After 5 hours, 5*2 = 10 will be there and 10*2 = 20, it means that 32 ants will be there after 5 hours.

According to the American Diabetes Association, \"Regular physical activity not only helps keep your weight in check but also helps burn calories to prevent you from packing on excess pounds. A pound of fat takes 3,500 calories to burn. Therefore, if you want to lose weight by burning about 400 calories a day, you have to stay physically active by exercising as frequently as possible. By exercising, you will also help improve your circululation and make your muscles more efficient at transporting sugar out of your bloodstream and using it as energy. But, don't start exercising if you already have diabetes or are at risk for diabetes. Talk to your doctor first. Begin an exercise routine slowly, under supervision, and allow your body to get used to it. Remember to warm up and cool down properly, and take plenty of stretch breaks, as well as rest periods. Exercise is much more than just sitting on an exercise bike or a treadmill.\"\nOutput: D: you need to work out in order to get healthy, and in order to avoid disease.", "answer": " 7"}

(D)The questions now is about a phone book and I think this one is a bit more obvious than the previous one, it is about the \"certificate\" because the phone book contains all certificates for all names. (E)Now we have a \"Headache\" problem but when he says \"I need to find out how to get in touch\" it is obvious that we have to look for something that contains names and numbers and therefore it is (D) a phone book.*", "answer": " 360"}

{"text": "A. 590\n\nInput: The sum of squares is the sum of the x-coordinates of the endpoints of all of the sides of a figure. The sum of the interior angles is the sum of all of the angles inside the figure.\nNow, we will examine the interior angles for a rectangle.  Consider the sum of the interior angles of a rectangle, so that is our sum of squares.  We are summing the interior angles which are the sides in our rectangular figure, so they are all x-coordinates, remember x is always squared.  So that is one squared, plus two squared, plus three squared, plus four squared.  Notice each x-coordinate only appears exactly once.  So we could stop right there and say, \u201cWell we are done, because we have only counted a number once and we double each time to get to the sum of the squares.\u201d And we find that the sum of the squares is just x squared + 2x  + 3x  + 4x  + x  as a result.  So what are the interior angles of a square?  Because we haven\u2019t done this already, let\u2019s examine that.\n\nConsider the interior angles for a square.  We see that the sum of the interior angle is 25.  If you look inside the square you can see that this is because we use the number 25 for one interior angle, because of the one corner.  We use 120 inside the square as the sum for the interior angles because each interior angle is the exact same as the one before it.  Finally, we can see that the sum of these two numbers, two plus one, equals three which gives us 25 as the total of the sum of the angles and we get the same number for the sum of the squares. As an example, to find the sum of the interior and exterior angles for a figure, let\u2019s find the sum for a square. The sum of the exterior angles is twice the sum of the interior angels. A square has 4 interior angles, so the sum of the interior angular is 4(3).  The exterior angle is two times the interior angle because it is twice around the figure which is the same as twice the sum of the interiors. So the exterior angle is actually two times a number that we just found a minute ago, and that number is 4", "answer": " 810"}

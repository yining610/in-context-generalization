{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense as it's referencing the same individual twice and, in addition, provides no relevant information about anything.\n5. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', respectively, are both feelings, so they probably won't be correct.\n6. Choices A and C, 'injury' and 'anxiety', are both concerns of a physical nature, though one is a result of an injury and one is a mental health issue. In other words, an injury can cause anxiety, but not vice versa and they don't share characteristics. Choice C, then, is probably not right.\n7. Choices D and E, 'happiness' and 'energy', are both positive emotional responses so they probably aren't correct.\n8. This leaves Choice B, 'tumultuous'. Though it doesn't seem directly related to performing, tumultuous is typically an unsettled state of mind, which may prevent one from feeling confident or being energized. \n9. Therefore, Choice B, 'Tumultuous', may represent what the individual is suffering from.\n10. Answer: C: talent persons cannot suffer fom injury and butterfle.\nAnswer: D, \"Fear of public speaking\".\n\nInput: Why did the scientist's face look puzzled? Choices:  [No option] 1. He was looking at some scientific data. 2. He was looking at photosynthesis. 3. He was looking at a chemical formula. 4. He was looking at his reflection in the mirror.\nRationales: The question is asking why the scientist's fae seems puzzled. This implies that for someone face to be puzzled, it first has to be not puzzled, and then something occurred which resulted in becoming puzzled. \n5. In the textual examples, Choice 1, 2, and 4 do not describe a face becoming puzzled. 6. Choice 3, \"He was looking at a chemical formla\" does not describe a face becoming confused, either, because chemical formulas are read, not viewed. 7. Choice 4, \"The mirror\" similarly does not describe \"looking\" at something.8. Therefore, the correct answer choice is \"He was looking at some scientific daata", "answer": " 5"}

Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', don't make sense as mental states that would inhibit someone from doing what they're talented in. \n6. Option D, 'anxiety', is a psychological state that could affect someone's participation in performing arts. We can eliminate choices C and E as related to happiness and anxiety, respectively. \n7. The word 'people' in the question could also be read as 'them', suggesting that the phrase 'talent but doesn't like to perform' applies to just one person, i.e. an individual, and not to people in general (such as a crowd), in which case only Choice D, 'anxiet',y can make sense.\n8.The only answer that fits the given context and eliminates choices that do not, is therefore Choice D: 'anxiet',, as it is the most plausible and logical answer to the question.\n9.

Choices:  M: by talking to them B: by looking at or around them C: by watching them D: none of these E: by looking at their face\nRationales:  1. The question asks how to identify if someone is happy.\n2. Considering what we typically understand happiness to be, what are some characteristics of a happy individual?\n3. Happy people frequently share positive thoughts, so we can pick an answer that pertains to talking. Choice M, 'talking to them', is not related to this, as it would also be possible to talk to them even if they were angry.\n4. As the question does not ask us to identify someone 'nearly' happy, but rather someone already happy (or unhappy), we can eliminate Choice C, 'looking at them', as this does not necessarily equate to someone who's already happy. \n5.

Choices:  A. excitement B. anticipation C. remorse D. empathy E. regret\nRationales:\n1.  We are asked to find what the correct adjectival response is to describe how the person felt after she gave into her friend\u2019s suggestion to adopt a puppy.\n2.  All of the choices given are emotions, they merely need to be related to the emotion of \u2018remorse\u2019.\n3.  All of the emotions given are adjectives \u2013 so what we need to do is find a noun (the dog) that correlates with the correct choice from the list.\n4.  Choices D, and E could possibly be emotions but both emotions are not in regards to the dog \u2013 they may be emotions concerning her decision to adopt the puppy but they do not follow up or proceed to the emotion of remorse after the event. Thus these two choices are not accurate.\n5.  The emotions given are all in regards to the dog - Choice A \u2018excitement\u2019 is an emotion the person might have following the adoption but the emotion is not about the dog\u2019s state of mind or feeling.\n6.  Choice B is a noun that could possibly be associated with the dog but it is a verb and the question is asking for an adjective \u2013 Choice B is incorrect.\n7.  Choice C is an adjective correlating with the emotion of \u2018Regret\u2019.\n8.  Choice C correlates to the emotion \u2018remorse\u2019\n9.

The answer should be a way to get to the park, but there is no mention of an actual location or object that can \"get\" someone to the park. Therefore, these answers are incorrect:\n```\n1. A: in the bike is incorrect because the answer should be a way; while a bike can \"get\" someone going to or from the park, a bike is not something that can \"get\" a person to or from the park.\n2. C: the car is incorrect because it can't be something, such as a bike, that someone rides to get to or from the park - a bike is not a way to the park.

If someone is talented but does not like performing, they probably do not have 'anxiety', as anxiety also doesn't make sense in relation to performance. \n8.

Choices:  a) Anatomy b) Diagnoses c) Medications d) Illnesses e) Disease e) All medical terminology listed above f) Answers a,c, and d\nRationales: Given the context of questions about medical terminology, choice A: anatomy and choice C: medications can be eliminated. \n1. Choice A: Anatomy, does not fall into medical terminology as anatomy is physical characteristics of the human body.\n2. Choice C: Medications, does not fall under medical terminology, as medications can refer to treatments but it can also refer to other types of substances that provide treatment.\n3. Considering choice D only:\n4. Illnesses, are something that a person has.\n5. Diagnosis and Diseases are not included in medical terminology, unless they are given further clarity.\n6.

It also misuses the word \"butterflies,\" which does not refer to the feeling of being nervous, but to the actual physical manifestation of a butterfly's wings moving. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness,\" is an extraneous concept as performing is a separate act. So, \"happiness\" does not necessarily affect if a person has performance anxiety or likes performance art. Moreover, a person may have a talent for performing but still be unhappy and anxious about it for multiple other reasons. It is important to note that they may feel anxious or unhappy about their talent and its implications.\n6. Choices C and D are not relevant either because being happy or having a talent do not negatively affect whether someone wants to perform. \n7. Hence, we are left with either Choice E or an irrelevant answer. \n8. Looking at Choice E, \"butterflies\", it is clear that the answer is B: talent persons cannot perform if they cannot suffer from anxiety and happiness.\n9.

Walking is not an option because walking is less physical and is often done outside.\n3. Consider options B, C and E. In option B - you could dance while running and the choice of your music determines whether it's dancing or running. Also, you can run and still dance, so it's not a strict answer. \n4.

The question refers to the reason the scientist begins her lecture at a particular time.\n2. After reviewing the choices, Choice B,'she likes to wake up people' and Choice D, 'there's nobody else available' seem implausible because typically, someone would not like to wake people up by starting a lecture early, especially when there are multiple other options for a lecture time.\n3. Choices A and E, 'it's too early' and'she likes to be early', both allude to the notion that the scientist would not wish to start the lecture early. \n4.

It could indicate any type of energy, but in general the question mentions that the person in question suffers from a particular reservation. It is reasonable to choose Choices E: energetic because 'energetic' specifically refers to having enough energy to carry out daily tasks, a concept related to the given context of talent. \n8. By considering all the choices, and evaluating how they correspond with the question, the best answer is E: energetic.\nAnswer: E. energetic", "answer": " 19"}
{"text": "flies', is also inaccurate as this isn't a statement; rather, it is wordplay.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', seem to fit the question as they both describe common states one might be in when performing their talent.\n6. Choices C, \u2018anxiety\u2019 and D, \u2018happiness\u2019, however, refer to emotional states, rather than reservations about publicly sharing one\u2019s talent, which is what the question is referring to. \n7. Furthermore, while one can be happy or anxious, most likely one would not be both at the same time.\n8. Thus, we can say that Choice D, 'happines', is unlikely.\n9. So, we are left with either Choice C, 'anxiet', or Choice D, 'energetic', as possible answers. However, Choice C, \u2018anxiet\u2019, is not likely. The question refers to reservations about performing one\u2019s talent and anxiety is a normal reaction to performing one's talent in front of others, which would be contrary to the given question. \n10. Choice D, \u2018energetic\u2019, on the other hand, seems to be what\u2019s happening in the given scenario. An energetic state is likely if one is an extrovert. Extroverts generally enjoy performing in front of others and are energized by social interactions. \n11. Thus, we can conclude that Choice D, \u2018happines\u2019 seems to be the correct answer. But for the last step, we want to eliminate the less accurate possibilities.\n12. Choice A, \u2018injury\u2019, doesn\u2019t make much sense. Even if this person had a talent, it doesn\u2019t seem reasonable that the talent be related to an injury.\n13. Choice B, \u2018talent persons cannot suffer fro injury and butterfies\u2019, is also incorrect as it is not a statement, but only wordplay.\n14. Choice E, \u2018energetic butterflies\u2019, is incorrect as they are contradictory. \u201cButterflies\u201d refers to nerves. However, this person is likely energetic if they have confidence in their talent. Therefore, it does not make sense to claim they are both butterflies", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as it is missing a subject. If it isn't about a specific person's talent in performing, then the subject is people in general and not a subset of that group (talented performers). We are looking for a phrase that makes sense talking about different people but may be related to performing. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is very different from the general tone of the phrase. Also, it wouldn't be a logical choice to make because many people want to perform, but they may lack the appropriate skills or not like being the center of attention. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is a reasonable choice. \n7. In a person who lacks enjoyment or interest in performing, they may also experience anxiety, especially in public situations where being on stage or facing an audience might cause nervousness.\n8. This would explain the person's unwillingness or difficulty in performing and also explain why they can't overcome it with simple support or encouragement. \n9. Therefore, Choice C: anxiety is the best option.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: How is a bird not considered a carnivore? Choices: 1. A: It can't eat meat 2. B: A bird usually doesn't eat carnivores. 3. C: It is an omnivore 4. D: It is a vegan 5. E: Birds eat a lot of plants 6. F: There's no such thing as a carnivore\nRationales: The logical progression should be A \u2192 B \u2192 C \u2192 D \u2192 E \u2192 (perhaps) F. Note that the assumption is that birds eat meat because of the use of the word \"usually\". The logical flow makes sense in this way. We should always start at an option with the lowest certainty before moving on to options with progressively higher certainty.\n1. Birds eat meat and we think that they are carnivores (hence, it is reasonable to assume that they eat meat). But here, the question introduces the possibility that a bird may be considered omnivorous.\n2. A bird eats meat and meat comes from an animal. But here, the question also introduces the possibility that that a bird may be referred to as carnivorous in some context", "answer": " 4"}

Looking at each of the options, we should start by eliminating illogical choices. \n3. First, we can eliminate choice D, mother-in-law, because the question gives the gender of'mother' as'my mom,' and it wouldn't be a mother-in-law she's talking about.\n4. Second, we can eliminate choice E, self, because we've been given the information that a mother cannot be their own mother.\n5. By eliminatin the choices, we are left with the most logical answer, choice C: grandmother.\nAnswer: C; grandmother\n\nInput: We decided to drive the old truck to the river. Which one would be a better place to drive it on its final journey? Choices:  a: the beach b: the lake c: the ocean d: the stream e: the pond \n\nRationales: Here, 'the Beach' is also used as a figurative expression for a state of happiness or relaxation. So, for now, let us eliminate all other choices.\n1: We need an answer that indicates a relaxed or happy state, not a final journey by any means.\n2. The choice C, the ocean can mean one or the other: but the more logical answer is: C the state of happiness.\n3. We must be careful to understand the specific meaning of words, because if it isn't clear and it has a literal meaning, it will be necessary to go to the dictionary for clarification. There are some words that you have learned at school but you don't really know their meaning. So, the more familiar you get with languages the more accurate the answer.\n\nAnswer: We decided to drive to our beach\n\nInput: The housekeeper was going to clean the house but not the entire house", "answer": " 700"}
{"text": "fly', is a grammatically incorrect and nonsensical phrase that does not contribute to the question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also not the answer as the question is not asking about happiness but rather about performing with anxiety, or performing reluctantly.\n6. There is no reason why someone with talent would have to suffer from anxiety in order to be happy. \n7. Choice E, energetic, does not make sense because the question is not asking what would make someone energetic, nor what quality a person would exhibit in this situation. \n8. Choice C, Anxiety, is the correct choice. It appears in the question as potentially causing anxiety around performing.\n9. Therefore the best choice of answer is C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C : Anxiety\n\nInput: Which is better to make people feel? Choices: \nA: tired B: sleepy C: tired D: happy E: sleepy\nRationales:\n1. The question is about which emotion is better to make people happy.\n2. None of the other choices, A: tired, B: sleepy, D: happy, E: sleepy, make sense.\n3. While, the choices may feel logical, as they all refer to states of sleep, they do not make sense when thinking about a person feeling tired, sleepy, or happy. \n4. To make people happy, they would have to feel happy, but how can people feel happy if they are sleepy or tired? \n5. Looking at C, sleepy, we know this is not what the question is looking for as it is stating that sleep is better than happiness, when in fact, the opposite is probably true. \n6.

{"text": "fly, has been eliminated as it contains irrelevant content, rather than addressing the question directly. \n5. Choice D, could be a reasonable answer, as it suggests a mental state, but we do not have any context for how a person might react to happiness.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energy' are close to the intent of the question, but they would be the effects of this state, rather than the state itself.\n7. Therefore it is fair to assume that the answer to this question has to do with a mental state or attitude that would prevent someone from performing. \n8. Choice B, is the answer we were looking for \u2013 that is a mental or psychological state. \nAnswer: B: anxiety", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": "flys', does not make sense because the entire sentence is a contradiction - people cannot suffer from an injury and butterflee (an exaggerated word choice), so any sentence that starts with 'talent persons cannot' cannot be valid. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic', lacks a description of what the person does not like, so it's not specific enough. \n6. This leaves Choices C and D, which describe a similar, psychological issue: anxiety and happiness, respectively.\n7. Although both can relate to anxiety or joy, 'happiness' doesn't really describe a state of not enjoying performing. Choice C, \"Anxiety\", which does describe the fear of something, aligns with the overall context better. \n8. Therefore, for this question, the best answer is Choice C, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: While walking at the park, I tripped and got hurt. Who was responsible for my pain? Choices:  I: park C: me B: my friend D: police E: ground\nRationales: As we are discussing a pain-related situation, it's important to narrow down which type of pain we're talking about. Specifically, is it a physical, bodily pain or an emotional or mental pain? To further assist in that question, lets look at the options for each of these pain types.\n\n    Physical    Emotional                     Mental\n    I      B    I        I          B       E\n    -    -   -       -         -        -      -\n    -   A   D     A        D           C       F\n\n  This table allows us to further simplify our answer choices by seeing which align to which type of pain.\n\nInput: When is a person most likely able to make a good decision?

{"text": "-', doesn't match the tone of the question as it uses negative language and uses 'and' while the question asks that it is an 'either....or'. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't work since the question is concerned with the individual's reservations about performances, not happiness in general. \n6. Choice 'Energetic' is not an answer as it is a general term regarding energy levels and does not specifically denote anxiety. \n7. Thus, it seems that Choice C, \"anxiety\" is the best answer. \n8. So, if someone is talent but does not like performing, they probably have some level of anxiety. \n9. Therefore, by eliminating the other options, the answer is Choice C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: Which of these things is a good way to prevent having a headache? Choices: \tA. Eat cereal B. Watch a movie C. Drink water D. Sleep E. Eat a snack\nRationales:  1. The question is concerned with ways to prevent having a head-ache.\n2. In order to figure out the best answer, it is first important to discard the incorrect choice.\n3. Choices (A), (B), and (C) are not ways of preventing a head-ache because the answer describes prevention (not treatment) in the form of a future action (the prevention of a headache). Choice (D) may be a way of preventing a headache, but it is not mentioned in the passage.\n4. Choices (D) and (E) may be ways of treating a headache. Choice (D) is explicitly mentioned in the passage. Choice (E) is not explicitly mentioned in the passage, but is most definitely a treatment of headache.\n5. This means we end up choosing Choice D (Sleep), which is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "fly', is a grammatically incorrect sentence, incoherent, which cannot answer the question\n5. Choice D, and E are both answers that describe positive emotions, that can also be linked to performing such as happiness or energy. These do not provide clarity as they could be linked to a successful or negative performance, either. \n6. Eliminating such answers, the remaining choices are 'anxiety' and 'talent'.\n7. When looking at 'Anxiety', it is associated with feelings, but again does not specifically refer to the ability or inability to perform. It also seems unlikely as the option itself is a feeling, and not a trait.\n8. Therefore in the context of this question, we can eliminate 'Anxiety' and consider 'Talent', which seems like a more likely choice given the information provided.\n9. However, 'Talent' is not a trait, as the trait is likely related to performing, not 'talent' itself, so 'Trait' is a better option to consider.\n10. By choosing 'Trait' we eliminate the grammatically incorrect 'Talent persons cannot suffer from...', as well as the more general option 'A person cannot suffer from a talent'. All of this leaves us with 'Anxiety' as the answer.\n  * Answer: C: anxiety.\n\n### Solution:\nA: When people want to see a new movie, they often go to the theater.\nB: Many people suffer from anxiety, and this is true even for those who show talent in performing in theaters. \n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following grade math example.\n\n### Problem:\nInput: Why was the scientist using so many trials?

{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense because this does not accurately describe the feeling the question tries to convey.\n5. Choices C and D both describe mental states that people could choose to cope with (and in some cases overcome). But this isn't what is being described so they can be eliminated. \n6. Finally, Choice E, 'energetic', describes a positive state of mind, which doesn't necessarily mean you like performing or don't like performing.\n7. Thus, we can deduce that this question is likely about something that causes distress and would impact a person's decision of whether to perform.\n8. Thus, this implies that the person suffering from this issue probably cannot perform anymore.\n9.

Choices:  - A: go back to the starting line. - B: start walking. - C: stop and ask a nearby sign. - D: find two trees. - E: find a big rock.\nRationales: A.

Choice D, happiness, isn't a valid choice either since the person in question may be happy to perform but simply does not perform. \n6. Choices C and E are similar, but C, 'Anxiety' matches the question better because it's more generic in nature and fits with the person's talent. \n7. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is Choice C, 'Anxieity'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: According to what the text said the dog would eventually lose the food. What did the text tell him to do? Choices: \nA: bury it\nB: throw it\nC: eat it\nD: return to where he left the food \nE: take the food\nRationales:\n1. The question wants a statement about if and how the dog will lose the food he's found. \n2. Based on this description about the dog loosing the food, we can rule out options B and E. They make no sense when you consider that the dog is losing the food. If you put it down you will have to bring it back to where you first had it. \n3. Looking at option A, to bury it, makes some sense, especially if the food looks like something you could have buried, like a bone. But the phrase \"with the intention\" makes this option suspect as you would normally not bury food that you can eat. \n4. Option C, to take it: eating it is one possibility, since he can't take it away or bury it. The only other thing we can think of is, if it's a dog, to play with it somehow. That can be eating it or playing with it and it loses.\n5. Option D, to return it to where he left the dog: makes more sense. You would return it to where you found it. If you return it to where you left the food he will not be able to find the food. \n6. Option D is correct.\nAnswer: EE: return to where you found it\n\nInput: How to make an ice cream sandwich?

{"text": "lies', doesn't make any sense as 'butterlies' (presumably a misspelling of 'butterflies') is the subject of the sentence. \n5. Choice D, is too broad a word choice as it is not specific to a single emotion. \n6. Thus remaining choices are: choice C ('anxiety'), and choice E ('energetic'). \n7. However, 'anxiety' does not fit as there is nothing about anxiety per say that is mentioned in the context of the question, the context is of someone with a talent but does not enjoy performing, that is, someone who is 'tentative'. \n8. Therefore, it seems the best answer is choice E: energetic.\nAnswer: E. energetic", "answer": " 136"}
{"text": "fly', is a non-sequitur, as 'butterfly' is not even mentioned in the question. \n5. Choice E, happiness, could be an option if the person in question were experiencing some form of depression that was affecting their performance, but that doesn't match the context of the question in this example, which includes an emphasis on the person being talented. \n6. Therefore, we should focus on the person's dislike for performing. \n7. Choice C, anxiety, could be a good fit. Anxiety refers to an unpleasant form of emotion that can have negative effects on a person.\n8. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit, as the emotions of happiness doesn't reflect a dislike for something on that order. \n9. Then we get to Choice E, energetic, this is possibly a good fit as it has a positive connotation, but there's something about the context that doesn't seem to connect to this type of emotion. \n10. In conclusion, the correct answer is Choice C, anxieties.\nAnswer: C; anxieties\n\nInput: The newest and one of the fastest trains on the track is the?

{"text": "fly', is invalid, as it makes no sense to eliminate a possibility based on what qualifies as an injury. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not relevant, as the question does not ask about what makes anyone, including someone who is talented but does not enjoy performing, happy. \n6. Similarly, Choice E, 'energy', is not relevant, as it could refer to emotional energy or physical energy. The question refers to the psychological condition of someone.\n7. Choices such as 'talent persons cannot be afraid of performing' or 'person who have talent are not performers' are irrelevant.\n8. Choice C, anxiety, however, does make sense, as an anxiety disorder relates to the human psyche and is a possible reason for someone to not enjoy performing.\n9.

Choices: 1: The poor quality, 2: it causes the reader to give a negative feeling toward the writer, 3: the author could then try to write better to gain a better outcome, 4: read it is not effective enough for the writer, 5: the poor quality\nRationales: The writing would be of poor quality if it is unable to bring a positive feeling within the reader when reading the writing. In order to do such, the author would need to be in the correct mood or have a positive influence on the reader by delivering something else (goods, news etc.) for the reader instead. \nThe following would then give the writer a positive or negative emotional influence upon the writer. \nThis would then give the answer of Choice no.2\nAnswer: Two\n\nInput: A number of people suffer from this unfortunate illness, what's its name?

{"text": "fly', contains the phrase 'talent persons', which is an odd formulation. The idea seems to be, if someone is talented at performing, they suffer from not wanting to do it, leading to a conflict of interest.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', matches the context better than choice D, 'happiness', as anxiety is a mental state that fits better with the question.\n6. Choices E, 'energy', and A, 'injuries', both don't make any sense here. The question is asking what the talented person might be suffering from.\n7.

{"text": "flys', doesn't apply either. The sentence is stating that talent persons can suffer from injury, followed by a general statement that talent persons often suffer from butterflies. \n5. Since the question is about performing, the talent is a performance skill, which this choice does not reflect. \n6. Choice C, \"butterfly\", doesn't make sense since there's no correlation between butterflies and performance anxiety in a chosen profession. The idea that someone is nervous about performing should relate to their profession, i.e. theater actors being anxious before being on-stage. On the contrary, being nervous isn't a typical feeling related to performance anxiety, which is more often tied to stage fright.\n7. Choices D and E don't make sense either. Happiness and energy don't reflect anxiety towards a specific task that one may be performing.\n8. Therefore the best answer is C, \"anxiety,\" as the choice describes the most appropriate feeling a person with this kind of talent might have.\nAnswer: C, anxiety\n\nInput: If two items cost less than five dollars, how much do they cost in total? Choices:  $ 199  $ 388  $ 507  $305  $864\nRationales:\n1. The question is looking for how much two items would cost in total if they cost less than 5 dollars. 2. The important thing to take note of here is that the question is asking \"How much do they cost in *total*\". This emphasizes that it's asking for an amount total rather than how much each item costs separately. 3. A quick way to check that a combination of options makes sense is to multiply the individual amounts and see if the total makes sense. 4. Taking the multiplication route from the previous step, we can see that only Choice D (A+B=C) fits. 5. We can therefore eliminate Choices A, B and C as they don't make sense when multiplied. 6. Answer therefore is D: 305 which is (388 *2) + (71 *2) which equals 778 - 152 = 626 + 152 =$304.\nAnswer: D,$305", "answer": " 2290"}
{"text": "fly', is not a viable answer as the question is asking about a psychological disorder, not an inability to perform physically or due to butterflies. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not fit as it may be a motivation to perform, but it is not a psychology-based disorder. \n6. Thus, we must look at the remaining choices, which are anxiety and energy. \n7. As the question suggests a lack of enjoyment, it makes more sense to be looking at a psychological disorder that produces negative effects on a person. \n8. We cannot choose Choice E, 'energetic', as that could be something that could cause enjoyment of performance. \n9. So, anxiety must be the correct answer.\nAnswer: D; It\n\nInput: What was the effect of adding milk to her coffee that she couldn't stomach? Choices:  Coffee A: taste B: the coffee was too smooth E: she didn't enjoy it D: she couldn't finish it C: she disliked the flavor\nRationales:\n1. We're starting with the clue that the coffee tasted different after adding milk to it and this is affecting the protagonist negatively.\n2. The question doesn't ask us how did she perceive the coffee was different exactly after adding the milk, it asks what the effect was.\n3. Let's look at the options available to try and figure out what the correct answer is. \n4. Option C, \"she disliked the taste of milk,\" is out of the question as milk doesn't taste different in coffee.\n5. Option A, \"the coffee's taste was too smooth,\" seems to have a high probability as we are given that the coffee tasted strange somehow.\n6. Option D: \"She couldn't finish her coffee,\" may sound right at first as we see that the coffee tasted unusual and the protagonist couldn't handle it (no pun intended).\n7. But the question is asking about what was the the effect of adding milk, not what was the effect of the coffee being not smooth. \n8. So we need to combine this and figure out what the effect would be. \n9. We could say that a coffee that is too smooth would likely have an adverse effect on", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "fly', isn't a correct phrase. \n5. Choice D, Happiness', is an emotion, not the kind of condition that the question is asking about. \n6.

Therefore, Choice B, Anxiety' is the best answer.\nAnswer: B: Anxiety\n\nInput: Why are sharks dangerous? Choices:  I: because they grow to be so large II: sometimes they attack tourists III: because they can swim fast IV: because they are venomous V: none of the above\nRationales: The question implies that shark are dangerous, so it must ask something like how they are dangerous. This type of question is answered by choosing all that apply. First identify how each choice answers the question and eliminate any answers with an incorrect response.\n\n1. Choice I: because they grow too large does not answer the question. Sharks may grow to be large, but that alone does not explain why they are dangerous. Also, the phrase, \"sharks grow to be so large\" doesn't make sense, as they do not grow themselves but the number with who they interact.\n2. Choice II: sometimes they attack is correct, as sharks do indeed sometimes attack people. However, being dangerous does not necessarily equate with attacking people.\n3. Choices III and IV have incorrect statements. Choice III states that a shark can swim fast. Sharks swim quite fast when in motion. However, there is no definitive speed for a shark that equates with being dangerous. Choice IV states that a shark is venomous, but not all sharks are venomous.\n4. Choices V: none of the answers are incorrect. However \"None of the above\" does not make sense as an answer choice if one has not been asked the question of any of the above.\n\nTherefore, the answer:\n\nChoice I, II, IV, V\n\nThe question was asking why sharks is dangerous. One must state something about being large or dangerous to answer the question. \n\nAnswer: None of the above\n\nInput:", "answer": " 21"}

However, if we know it's applicable, it makes sense that the person is suffering due to an injury.\n5. Choices C and E, 'were they happy and energetic', do not apply because not only is there uncertainty regarding their mood at that point, but also because being happy and energetic is not a reason not to perform. \n6. The remaining choices are B and D: 'anxiety and talent persons cannot suffer from a injury and butterfley' and 'a happiness and butterfly'. \n7. B fits best because it is the most specific match to the given information, and it's the most plausible reason someone would not do perform.\n8.

The object which is referred in question is brake.\n\n1. Choice A: Broken steering wheel: This will cause the brake to fail. As result, a car accident will occur\n\n2.

{"text": "fly,' doesn't make any sense. There is also a spelling error in this choice. \n5. So, from Choices A and B we can eliminate the possibility that injury or talent person's are the correct answers. \n6. Looking at Choice C, 'anxiety', is closely related to performing because it can result from having to prepare for a performance. However, anxiety is a feeling rather than an actual injury.\n7. Choices D and E, 'happiness' and 'energetic', are similarly related to performing. However, while they are feelings or types of emotions as well, they are not necessarily related to an actual injury. \n8. This leads us to Choice C, which refers to the feeling of anxiety, so that's the correct answer: Choice C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: ____________ and squirrels are classified under the category of an animal.

Looking for category answers, we must identify the type of question and the animal being tested as an indicator of the type of category answer.\n2. The choice can be either A or B - animals.\n3. Butterflies and squirrels do not fit the choices at hand.\n4. Raccoons do not come under the category of animals, hence they would not belong to this category.\n5. Fish do not fall under the category of animals and neither does plants.\n6. Bat is the final choice which does fall under the category of animal animals and so we have the correct answer.\nAnswer: E.

Looking at both the question and the choices, it is likely that option T, all but georgia, is not the correct answer;\n2. This is because option T refers to the time period when Georgia became a state, but the question is asking for the number of states in the thirsteen colonies, not in the thirteen colonies with georgia included.\n3.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make logical sense as although a person with talent may feel anxious, butterflies don't cause anxiety. Moreover, butterflies are not a sufficient replacement for anxiety. Choice B is therefore incorrect. \n5. Choice D, \u201chappiness\u201d, doesn't fit either; it indicates a lack of unhappiness, not the presence of a mental reservation about performing. Choice D is therefore incorrect. 6. Choice E doesn't relate to the performance of talent through a performance art either, as being talented at singing and acting isn't equivalent to being energetic.\n7. Choices C and E refer to psychological states instead of activities, so they can be eliminated. 8.

Choices: \nA: put the excess food on the floor\nB: throw things away\nC: put things on the floor\nD: put excess food on the floor and in the trash\nE: open the door\nRationales: The question is asking for what you should do about the excess food or waste in the fridge if there is too much to fit.\n1. Given the context of the question, putting things on the floor is not a valid answer as it does not get food out and prevents food from cooling.\n2. Putting things on the floor is also inefficient as it leaves no space for new food items. \n3. Throwing things out is a sufficient answer as it gets rid of the excess food items and leaves room for more.\n4.

Choice E describes the subject as \"energetic\", which is not necessarily a problem but can suggest a high energy and passion that the subject might have issues reining in during a performance.\n8.

The possible responses are: a) ride a donkeys; b) be a cow; c) fall off the ground; d) run into a walls; e) get on a mototcycle.\n3. Of these, we can eliminate possible responses one at a time.\n4. a) ride a donkies: In this context, donkeys cannot be used to travel unless on a farm, where a horse cannot be used.\n5. b) be a cow: While being a cow is a possible response, it doesn't make sense when the cow boy could have chosen to become a cow, rather than being a cow.\n6. c) fall off the groun: Falling off the ground is a possibility but doesn't suggest anything about what could have prevented it from happening.\n7. d) run into a wail: This response suggests the cowboy had no control over his situation and wouldn't have expected it to happen.\n8. e) get on a mocycle: While this response could be applicable, it is also unlikely as a motorcycle is unlikely to be the form of transportation for a cowboy.\n9. Therefore the answer is f) no one knows: the cowboy might, depending on the specific circumstances, chose to remain in his position, ride a donkey or fall off the ground.\nAnswer: f) no one knows\n\nInput: What were the first two items made?

{"text": "flys,' makes no sense as neither refers to a psychological issue. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also irrelevant, as it has nothing to do with performing, especially a talent for performing.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energy,' are also irrelevant, given the context in which they are used. \n7. Thus, we focus on only the two relevant possibilities: Choice D, 'talent,' and Choice E, 'anxiety'. \n8. We know that the person must suffer from anxiety if they have a talent but still do not perform. If they are anxious but also have talent, then we can safely eliminate the choice of 'talent'.\n9. Next, we will turn to 'anxiety', the possibility that was left. The way that the two choices are presented in the question \u2013 \"does not enjoy performing\", followed by \"perhaps suffers from... anxiety\" \u2013 suggests that an inability to perform is a symptom of a larger issue like anxiety. \n10. Hence, we can say that the person suffers from anxiety because they do not enjoy performing even with their talent.\n11.

It is because they will be tired even if they do not go to bed at the exact same time each night. \nThe scientists can't just go to sleep early as that will jeopardize the experiments that need to be done. \nThe scientist may be working on something so sensitive that they are afraid they will sleep through it. \nIt is important to note that it is not just a task of writing down some random information, but conducting productive research. \nTherefore, it has to be done in a way that will not end in a lost opportunity. \nThe answer to the question", "answer": " 240"}

Therefore the best choice is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C anxiety\n\nInput: Which item on the list could be described as the opposite? Choices: \nA: a car  B: an animal C: a pen  D: a building  E: an apple\nRationales:\n1. By the question asking, \"Which item on the list could NOT be described as the OPPOSITE\". The clue here is OPPOSITE, that is a person is trying to determine is something the OPPOSITE or NOT?\n2. Starting by looking at CAR, which is on the list...\n3. CAR and PEN are both objects and are both INERT items (meaning that they tend not to move), therefore, both could NOT be the opposite.\n4. BUILDING and APPLE are both the OPPOSITE of \"MOVEABLE\" (again INERT), therefore, CAN NOT be the opposite of the others.\n5. An ANIMAL is not \"MOVEABLE\", it is an INERT ITEM, therefore, if not the opposite of another INERT item, then the opposite of that item has to be a MOVEABLE.\n6. Therefore, MOVEABLE is the OPPOSITE of an ANIMAL\n7. MOVEABLE, in turn, is the opposite of AN INERT ITEM (a BUILDING & an APPLE)\n8. Now MOVEABLE, has only one thing to be the OPPOSITE of, an INERT ITEMI, a PEN & a CAR.\n9. There are two things we know about an INERT ITEMS, its INERT and can not be MOVEABLE.\n10. Since PEN and CAR are INERT, they cannot be moveable and are definitely NOT AN OPPOSITE!\n11. ONLY an AN ANIMAL can be THE OPPOSITE of an INERT ITEMENT, A P", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": "flys', is a non-sequitur in this context. \n5. Choice E, while 'energetic' might describe how the person feels, we are describing whether or not the person would like to perform, which suggests that the reason they may not enjoy performing is a feeling of anxiety or apathy.\n6. Therefore, the choice that makes the most sense to us is Choice D: Anxiety.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: Anxiety\n\nInput: A: the man on a street. B: the boy on a bike.

{"text": "fly', has an error in grammar, and therefore is incorrect. \n5. Choice D, D: 'happiness, doesn't fit as happiness is usually a positive state and there is no logical reason to suggest that an artistic talent is inconsistent with happiness. \n6. Choice B, C, 'anxious', is a viable answer as worrying or anxiety is a common symptom in introverts, who may also relate performance arts. \n7. Choice E, E: 'energy', can refer to either mental or physical energy, but it's unlikely that it would refer to a person's ability to perform. \n8. This leaves us with three viable choices: A, C, and D. \n9. Choice D, C, 'happiness', indicates that a talent may not be consistent with being happy. While some people do have talents and happiness, there is no specific relationship in the prompt to indicate that it is correct. \n10. Choice C, D, 'anxiety', relates to the question\u2019s prompt as an apprehension to perform may exist. \n11. It seems likely that the talent in question is a performance art and anxiety may relate specifically to that. \n12. Therefore, the best choice is \"C: anxiety\"\nAnswer: C: anxiety", "answer": " 350"}
{"text": "flys', is another confusing choice, and is irrelevant as well.\n5. Choices D and E, however, do seem to relate. \n6. What would a performer need to be successful? Presumably, it's a sense of happiness.\n7. Therefore we can eliminate Choices B, C and E. \n8. From the remaining choices, Choice D, 'anxiety' makes sense.\n9. However, we still have Choice D: anxiety left on our list of options. \n10. Anxiety is a possible component of performance anxiety, but it can be overcome with effort and planning.\n11. Alternatively, Choice C, 'happiness', might also be a cause of someone's hesitation to perform, given that having a sense of happiness is a crucial aspect of overcoming anxiety.\n12. Therefore, it is possible to be talent, not enjoy performing, and happy at the same time. \n13. So, because Choice C does not exclude the options B and D, We can eliminate it. \n14. Therefore Choice D: anxiet makes the most sense.\nAnswer: D, anxiety\n\nInput: A scientist wants to determine what happens below an iceberg? Choices:  B: the North Pole C: the South Pole D: the sea floor E: nothing\nRationales: In this task, an iceberg is underwater, so they scientist will want to determine what is underneath the iceberg.\n1. Since the iceberg is underwater we know that the scientist does not want to find out what happens above the iceberg.\n2. If the iceberg is melted then the scientist doesn\u2019t want to determine anything since an iceberg is an area of sea covered by ice.\n3. Choices C and D are the only non-irrelevant answers.\n4.

The given question indicates that it is asking what the answer to a riddle is, indicating that there is already an answer that needs to be identified, rather than the question generating one. \n2. The given answer to the riddle (the least important person) is the best one because it aligns with the instructions (the answer is not the most important person, rather it is the least important person).\n3.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect as well. Talent alone is not enough for someone to suffer from their nerves.\n5. Choices C, \"Anxiety\" and E, \"Energized\", are related to state of mind, or mood, and are thus irrelevant. \n6. Choice D, \"Happiness\", is too generalized and unlikely of an issue.\n7. Therefore we can start to narrow the list down by eliminating options that don't seem relevant.\n8. We can also eliminate choices where the option is worded as a statement. Choices that start with \"talent persons cannot suffer...\" can be eliminated because each of these can be disagreements.\n9.

{"text": "fly', is a grammatically incorrect statement, which means it's a non-option.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness' respectively, relate to psychological tension or emotional happiness, two different points of reference to what the word 'butterflies' implies - that it's a negative thing to feel apprehension before performing.\n6. Choices E and B are incorrect, too, because 'energetic' doesn't help the performer overcome their nervousness and 'talent persons cannot butterflies' indicates that being nervous is not a choice.\n7. Therefore the best answer could be either B or D: C and D are psychological concepts, suggesting that the performer has a talent, but is also nervous about performing.\n\nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot butterfies\nRationales: In this task, if someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, they would likely have issues expressing their talent\n8. However, Choices B and D could be both acceptable answers because they both relate to specific psychological concepts, with Choice B suggesting an irrational or excessive nervousness, and Choice D suggesting a fear of performing.\n9. Therefore we can't choose any of the options as the correct answers, but we can eliminate those that are likely incorrect.\n10. In this case, Choices A, C and E can be eliminated as they don't reflect what butterfly means. Choices B and D don't have any flaws and could both be correct answers.\nAnswer: B: Talent persons cannot suffer from injuries and butterflies\nRationales: As long as they are choosing the right answer, a correct response will also be one that uses a variety of concepts and techniques. \n11. Thus, the better answer can still be one of many.\n12. Choice B, Talent persons cannot suffer butterflies, is a grammatically correct statement, even with the word play on butterflies.\n13. Choice D, Talent persons cannot butterfly, is a grammatically incorrect, so it is excluded right away. \n14. Choice B has two correct ways of being put together, making both B and D likely answers. \nAnswer: D: Talent persons", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "fly', implies that the cause of the person's dislike of performing could be due to anxiety. An 'anxiety' response makes us think about emotions associated with anxiety, not injury or butterflies. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also not relevant as the focus is on the person not liking to perform instead of their happiness around it. \n6. Choice B, talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety and butterfly, still suggests the person may be experiencing emotions around performing and therefore an anxiety response may be more suitable. \n7. Hence, it seems logical to choose A, 'Anxiety'. It is relevant, it applies to performance arts, it is psychological. And, since the question does not define what type of anxiety it is, a range of answers is possible.\n Answer: A: Anxiety\n\nInput: What might a surgeon's job be similar to? Choices: \n  * A: carrot salesman\n  * B: doctor\n  * C: janitor\n  * D: bus driver\n  * E: dental surgeon\n  * F: hairdresser\nRationales:\n1. The given set of options must include some plausible surgeon's job, which most people might not be familiar with.\n2. Surgeons often work with surgical instruments to resolve medical problems (cutting/fixing/removing parts of patient), so an option to represent the surgeons is to use the word 'tools'.\n3. Out of these set of options, only the 'tools' is unique and applicable given the instruction.\n4. Thus, by eliminating all other options, we can confidently choose B: 'doctor'.\nAnswer: B: doctor\n\nInput: Which of the following is commonly defined as an animal, a plant, a person, a human or a living thing?

{"text": "fly', doesn't fit either as a person cannot be suffering, nor experience butterflies from an injury.\n5. Option D, 'happiness', does not apply here because \"butterflies\" doesn't directly relate to happiness or not enjoying performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\" does not apply as \"butterflies,\" as it may imply, are not a direct result of anxiety. \n7. So, what does that leave us with? \n8. Choice B, \"anxiety.\" \"butterflies\", after all, are commonly associated with anxiety.\n9. Therefore it appears that 'Anxiety' is best answer to the question.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety.\n\nInput: If a person has a lot of pets, they like what? Choices: A: the outdoors, B: being close to people, C: staying indoors, D: being close to the outdoors\nRationales: We need to determine what it is that people who have a lot of pets like.\n2. We can eliminate anything that is negative - like disliking pets or being close to people - as that would not be a natural statement for a person with a lot of pets to make.\n3. We need to work out what characteristics of people in general they might have. \n4. Some possibilities are liking pets, being close to people, staying indoors or being close to the outdoor. \n5. We must use the context or meaning of the first part of the sentence to determine how 'like' is being used.\n6. We know that the first part of the statement says 'If person has lot of pets' and that suggests someone likes something. \n7. If someone can be said to have lots of the same pets, then that suggests someone likes each one of them. \n8. That means, if a person has a lot pets, they like being close to people or the outdoors.\n9. Hence C,'staying indoors' or 'being close to the outdoos', is the most correct answer.\nAnswer: C = staying indoors ( or being close to the outside).\n\nInput: If an individual has multiple jobs, they are good at what", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "flys', is irrelevant given that the question is asking about the person's talent rather than their physical or health state. \n5. Choice D, does seem potentially relevant as it would mean this individual is unhappy, so we'll keep it for the time being. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, does also seem relevant but can be considered too broad in this context. If someone suffers from anxiety they likely would not be able to perform either. \n7. Choice E, happiness, seems irrelevant as it does not relate to performing. \n8. Choice B, talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety, does sound a bit strange, but remember that this person doesn't like performing. \n9. So, we can eliminate option A, B, C, E, and decide to go with D, which is the only one that might mean this person is unhappy about performing.\n10. Therefore, the best choice is D: unhappiness, as this would indicate that the individual we are curious about is unhappy, which may prevent them from performing, and does fit the scenario.\nAnswer: F: talent persons cannot suffer\n\nInput: The scientist has decided to create a new form of potion, what is the next step?

To choose which is the best, we can analyze each choice and see which would best suit the situation. \n1. Choice A: 'experiment all day long' is a good choice, but we should consider that at times scientist can experiment in different ways in which they can't do a lot research. \n2. Choice B:'research all day long' may help to find a new potion, but it wouldn't exactly help it be good. \n3.Choice C: 'find better potion' is what this scientist is doing with this potion.

{"text": "fly', is an incorrect sentence as butterflies are inanimate. In addition, there is an incorrect use of the word \"can\" as it suggests an inability whereas performing can be a matter of choice or circumstance.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', are psychological states. However, both these conditions could apply to an individual who is comfortable performing or not comfortable performing and are not necessarily indicative of being talent or not talent.\n6. Therefore, we are left with Choices B and E.\n7. Choices B and D don't make sense as butterflies can't cause injuries nor can injuries cause butterflies.

Choices: \t A: Start the project at once so I won't procrastinate B: Complete the project as soon as I can complete the whole project in time C: Do more work than expected D: Finish the project before the due date\nRationales:\t 1. The question asked what to do when a person had too little time to complete a project, so naturally there would be some expectation that the question was related to finishing the project.\n2. It'll be important to analyze the choices to see what they implicate regarding 'too little time'. \n3. Choices A and C, 'Start the project' and 'Do more work', require adding time to the project. These aren't really answers to the problem of a short timeline, so they aren't the right answers.\n4. Choices B and A, 'Complete the project' and 'Don't procrastinated', may be related to completing a project, but they don't quite fit with the problem of too few hours to do a project.\n5.

{"text": "lies', does not make sense because butterflies are not mental disorders. Moreover, it is possible to be both talented and have butterflies, as butterflies may cause one to get nervous or lose their confidence. \n5. Eliminating possibilities, we can make choice B incorrect (eliminating it). \n6. Choice C, anxiety, makes sense in context with the question, as anxiety often refers to a mental condition related to stress and worry. \n7. Eliminating choice B and choice C, we're left with choices D and E. \n8. However, we know that a talent performer is not defined solely by their ability to perform, they can also possess other talents.

What should the scientist watch for afterward? Choices: 1. A: if the dog vomited B: whether he would eat again C: a possible diarrhea D: what the dog would do after eating E: all of these\nRationales: The question's purpose is to ascertain what the scientist should watch for after giving the dog the new treat.\nThe question asks about what the scientist should observe after giving the dog the food. The scientist doesn't want to know how long the dog will take to eat the food, nor is she interested in discovering if it likes the food.\nA. The scientist doesn\u2019t want to watch for the dog vomiting from eating.\nB. Giving the dog another treat after he eats one may not be appropriate or in line with what the scientist is trying to achieve, so this answer doesn\u2019t apply to this scenario.\nC. The question only suggests that the food would be a new item of food for the dog, so it doesn\u2019t make sense that the scientist would be concerned about diarrhea.\nD. The scientist has already shown an interest in observing the dog\u2019s", "answer": " 200"}

Choices: \nA: He answered the phone\nB: He threw the phone because he didn't have the right number\nC: He yelled at the caller\nD: He hung up the phone\nE: He put the phone away in his pocket\nRationales:\n1. It's important that the response answer the question being asked rather than just make sense.\n2. Here, we're looking for the correct answer from the given options.\n3. As a result, we can eliminate all of the answers that are incorrect, such as options D and E. \n4. Next, as options A and B both involve doing something with the phone, we can assume the best answer will involve the phone being either on or off. \n5. We can eliminate options A and C since they make the phone active.\n6. Therefore, the best option is B: \"He threw the phone because he doesn't have the right phone.\"\n7. We know from the question that the person in question did not have the right phone number, so to make sense, \"the phone\" here would have to refer to one that was the wrong number. \n8. \"He threw the phone\" makes sense and, therefore, this should be the correct answer.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: He threw the phone\n\nInput: The man made a promise to the woman that he would take her out on this date at this place, where they can have lunch together.

The context of the question is that a person wanted to see the latest romance movie and asked people around but did not know what place to go.

Choice D, \"happiness', doesn't make an appropriate answer because happiness is not necessarily the reason the person does not like performing.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energetic', are too specific about emotion, which does not explain the individual's initial reluctance to perform\n7. Therefore, after eliminating all irrelevant choices, the answer that remains is choice B, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: One of the signs of an allergic reaction is inflammation. Another sign is an itchy sensation. Which of the following is not a sign of an allergic reactions?

However, one can have an allergic reaction and not have swelling or itchy skin.\n\n### C: 'nausea' is not a symptom of an allergic response. It is more often a symptom of exposure to airborne allergens.\n\n### D: 'Anaphylactic Shock', while often seen in allergic reactions, is not an exclusive sign of an allergies. \n\n## Answer: D: 'Anaphlactic Shock' is not a common occurrence", "answer": " 63"}
{"text": "fly' is also irrelevant since we only have a reference to 'talent persons' and the question doesn't state what the actual talent is. \n5. Similarly, Choice C, 'anxiety', doesn't apply as it doesn't mention anxiety about performing but general anxiety, which does not provide context for the question. \n6. Therefore, we are left with Choice D, 'happiness', and Choice E, 'energetic'.\n7. The question isn't referring to this person being happy or energetic, but if they are talent but don't like performing then it makes sense that if they feel unhappy or unenergetic when performing then they don't feel any happiness or enthusiasm while performing.\n8. Therefore we conclude that Choice E, 'anxiety' fits and makes the most sense here.\nAnswer: E.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense in the given context either. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness'\", doesn't seem appropriate in this context either. It is true that some people may be happy if they're not performing, but this does not seem to fit in the given scenario because the person is likely still talented. \n6. Choice B, \"anxiety\" makes more sense because we are concerned about an inhibiting discomfort, or lack of enjoyment. \n7. So, option B is the most accurate.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: How could one determine if the object of interest has more than four legs? Choices:  HAIR ANIMAL EYES ALIVE WEIGHT\nRationales: There is not much information that we are given, so let us use our critical thinking skills to figure out the answer.\n1. Using critical thinking, we can determine that an objective of this prompt is to identify animals that have more than 4 legs.\n2. An animal is a type of creature, not an object.\n3. EVERY living creature has hair so that excludes that entire choice.\n4. EYES doesn't really tell us anything, since it could mean either eyesight or having eyes.\n5. WEIGHT, by definition, is an object's mass.\n6. We've got some key information to work with.\n7. If the creature of interest has ALIVE but not HAIR ANIMALS, then it must have more than 4 or fewer than 4 legs. So the creature must be an ALIVE ANIMAL.\n8. To further determine the answer, we can use inference where we draw logical conclusions by applying reasoning.\n9. Let us rephrase the prompt, where the creature of interest must have more than 5 legs and it could belong to the MAMMALIA class and it could also live on land.\n10. So, the answer to the prompt is MAMMALIA because it has more than 5 legs.\nAnswer: ALIVE ANIMALS (MAMMALIA belongs to the Mammalia class)\n\nTo identify or verify the best answer, ensure that the statements of the instruction and the rationale you provided appropriately complete the request.\n\n\n#### 13.6", "answer": " 2210"}

{"text": "flys', although clever and possibly true in a literal sense, is not the actual question and isn't required to answer it. \n5. Also, it's not clear what 'butterflys' are, which further invalidates this choice. \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, does not fit because it is a psychological disorder that can involve feeling nervous, irritable or apprehensive. \n7. While this can arise from a lack of performing arts experience, it would not cause the person to not want to perform. \n8. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, doesn't seem to fit either as the question seems to imply there are underlying reasons for resisting performing. \n9. Choice E, \u2018energy\u2019, seems similar, but the question specifically states that they suffer from not wanting to perform, which doesn't fit with an energetic/enthusiastic personality. \n10. This leaves us with choices B and C as the best options, which both refer to psychological disorders that are commonly associated with anxiety or an aversion to performing.\n11. While choice C also describes them as 'cannot suffer from injury and buttterfly', it is less relevant to the actual question since it was eliminated as unnecessary. \n12.

Choices E, 'energetic', and 'happiness' could be either a cause or effect of the other.\n8. Looking at what we know, we can narrow the choices down to 'anxiety' as the only remaining choice, because anxiety is the emotion that describes this situation.

The question is trying to understand why one's house looks like a hive of activities, because someone had come to help them with a long-term roofing project. A house full of workers, all having the same purpose (repairing a roof), will look busy and hectic, even when that's the point. \n2. This question is asking why the house looks like this. It's a descriptive word that can be answered based on the answer to the question.\n3. There is no need to guess as the answer is straightforward. 4. If this was a test of your knowledge of why people hire friends, it would make sense, but it's explicitly said \" Why did my house look?\".\n5. Let's analyze the choices:\n6.

People who are a certain age only, those who aren't a certain age aren't eligible or allowed to drive, so we can eliminate that choice.\n2. People who are at school, that means that younger people are not allowed. We can eliminate that one too.\n3. Only people who are above a certain age, anyone under that age can't drive. That one is out of contention too, unless of course your in a school where you have to be older to study there. Which brings us to choice 4.\n4. Only people who go to school are the eligible group. Thus, anyone who doesn't go to school would be unable to drive a motorbike, and anyone over the legal age can. That leaves us with choice 4.\nAnswer: 4.

To find the least expensive option, multiply the price of each item by the quantity you have. For example, an item priced at $1.50 costs $1.50, or $1.50 x 1, which is equivalent to $1.50. If you had 5.50 $5.50, which would you buy? Answer: Option d) is the answer, even though it seems like the simplest option \u2013 five 1 pound bags of Broccoli or Carrots.

If a person has ten dollars and desires 2 lbs. of steak, he is not obligated to purchase it if it exceeds the ten dollars. This rule can be applied to the question.

Choices:  a. when the score is tied b. when the opposing team runs out of players c. when the players become injured d. when there is no winner e. none of the above\nRationales:\n1. The question is specifically asking about 'when a [base]ball [game] is considered a draw'.\n2. 'Draw' can only be applied to baseball games as it is used specifically to refer to games within the sport.\n3. Therefore, it does not make sense to list other sports as options.\n4. Consider first how draw can be applied in a baseball game. It could be during any part of a game. Score? No, both teams must have completed at least 5 innings during the match to consider a draw.\n5.

{"text": "fly,' does not connect to the question.\n5. Choose C: 'anxiety,' relates to an emotional sensation of apprehension or nervousness. If someone is talented but has an anxiety about performing, this may be because fear of failure will impede their desire to perform. \n6. Choice D, happiness, doesn't relate to the question because if the individual is talent, they may struggle to overcome their apprehension to perform. \n7. While Choice E, 'energetic', does describe some personalities, being energetic and not suffering from anxiety about performing doesn't equate to being talented.  \n8. Therefore, we are left with Choices B and C.\n9. Among the choices, Choice C, 'anxiety,' is the best answer because anxiety can prevent someone from pursuing their talent even before performing.\nAnswer: C anxiety\n\nInput: To be a hero, one needs determination and what else? Choices:  P: good looks  Q: a goal  R: speed  S: strength  T: none of these  U: a purpose  V: compassion  W: intelligence\nRationales:  1. The question asks which quality a hero needs other than determination.\n2. There is no correct or wrong answers, however, the correct one is most likely the most plausible one. \n3. Eliminations:\n4. (T:None Of These): None of these does not directly answer the question.\n5.(U:a purpose): a purpose is a general objective that a person has for themselves to achieve. Since a hero has to have a purpose, it does not relate to the question because the question asks the quality a hero needs other the determination.\n6. (S:Strength): Strength is a quality that a hero can have, but it does not answer the question.\n7. (R:Speed): Speed is also a quality one hero can have, but like strength, it does not answer the questions.\n8. (Q:a goal): The question does not require a goal. A goal is when someone works toward an objective.\n9.

{"text": "flys', doesn't seem to provide an answer at all and would be an unwieldy explanation for having conflicted feelings about performing. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not related to having conflicted feelings about performance. \n6. Let's look at the choices that are related to having reservations about performing. \n7. The choices that still remain are anxiety and energetic. \n8. For this question, all answers are provided as adjectives. Adjectives usually describe physical or emotional feelings, which make them more suitable to describe a specific person's reaction to performing. \n9. As anxiety could describe a physical response to performing, it is likely to be the most suitable answer. \n10. For example, if a person is not confident or comfortable with performing they may become anxious prior to performing. \n11. However, if the person is energetic and confident, they may have butterflies in their stomach and feel anxious as a result of this. \n12. They may also feel more energetic, which could be a result of being nervous. \n13. In this situation, the person is both energetic and anxious, which both describe emotional responses to performing. \n\n14. The question seems to be implying that someone has anxiety about performing, even though they have a talent for performing. \n15. Therefore, the answer choice for this is choice D: anxious.\nAnswer: A:(1),B:(4),C:(8),D:(5),E:(3),F:(9),G:(13)\n\nInput: For better communication, it's important to make eye contact with your audience and speak with what?

It also seems important for the speaker to have a solid idea in their mind regarding an idea or emotion. \n\nEye contact is important to communicate better because eye contact can show whether you are being sincere or not.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect as it directly contradicts the fact that the person can suffer from injury and does have the required talent to do so. It's also awkward and incorrect in grammatical usage. We can eliminate this choice. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't directly related to performing as performing is something to which we apply a certain level effort or stress, regardless of how we feel about it. Being happy or sad about that doesn't determine whether or not someone enjoys performing. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is also generally related to a state of mental health or emotional well-being, so we can eliminate this as a possibility also.\n7. Choices C, 'butterflies', and E, 'energetic', aren't even related to performing, so we can eliminate these.\n8. Choice C, as 'anxiety', is a mental issue and is related to performing, we can infer that the person in this context enjoys performing but experiences anxiety about performing, which is related to a state of well-being.\n9. Therefore the best answer is C, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: In 2050 what two locations will be the major population centers of the entire world both in terms of number of humans and area?

The choices are both A and E in terms of number of population living in it, but B is the larger area.\n\n3. The answers do not include A, B, C, D and E.\n\n4. F is not in the list.\n\n5.

{"text": "fly', is irrelevant as it makes no mention of performing.\n5. Choices D and E, 'happiness' and 'energy', refer to emotional states rather than a disliking of performing, so these are also not relevant. \n6. Thus, we are left with two choices to consider. \n7. Choice B, anxiety', does not fit because it relates to being anxious about performing. The question suggests the person suffers from not performing.\n8. Choice C, \"talent\", does not describe a physical or emotional state, it merely describes a gift. \n9. Therefore, this answer does not make sense, and this option must be eliminated. \n10. Therefore, the best choice is choice B, 'anxiety', as it is a relevant answer to the question in which someone suffers from a reluctance to perform.\nAnswer: B: anxiety", "answer": " 41"}
{"text": "fly's', is a nonsensical comment that does not make logical sense because it assumes that talent is incapable of experiencing injury or dealing with anxiety. \n5. Choice D, happy person cannot suffer from anxiety, is a nonsenscal response, given that anxiety is a mental condition that can affect a person's disposition, which does not necessarily have to be positive.\n6. Choices C and E are both very similar to one another, so it's better to eliminate one of them since they each seem vague and inaccurate. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is a mental state, so it does not account for physical limitations, and there doesn't seem to be any reason to associate anxiety with this question. \n8. Choice E, \"energetic\", is too vague because it doesn't indicate any connection to the question, and it's not typically a symptom of not liking performing.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is B: 'talent cannot suffer from injury and anxiety.'\nAnswer: A: 'injury' is a physical limitation.\n\nInput: The fish was going swimming when it spotted a jellyfish, what was the fish likely thinking?

{"text": "flies', is a misinterpretation of the meaning of butterflies that is not supported or relevant to the question. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\", doesn't directly impact the ability to perform. \n6. Only choices C and E are left. \n7. Choice C, \"Anxiety\", is the most direct option because it specifically refers to emotional or psychiatric issues. It matches the scenario provided, as a person may choose not to perform because they are worried about how they will do, or being judged or criticized.\n8. Therefore the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: E. anxious\n\nInput: Where did John and his friends go last weekend? Choices:  D: home A: grocery store B: mall C: school E: gym\nRationales:  1. The question asks about where John and his friends went last weekend.\n2. Option D, 'home', does not make sense for the scenario given.\n3. Option E, 'gym', refers to a place where people often go to exercise, but does not tell us that John and his friends spent their leisure time there.\n4. Option C,'school', is unlikely as they would just go to their home if they were going somewhere.\n5. Therefore, option A, 'grocery store', is the correct choice as it states people went there.\nAnswer: A. grocery store\n\nInput: Which of the following does a soccer player do? Choices:  E: take selfies B: score goals C: drink water D: kick balls E: win medals\nRationales:\n1. The question is referring to the general term of person, and is using soccer as the scenario.\n2. Option B,'score goals', states that a soccer player'scores goals', which is part of the player's actions for a game.\n3. However, the player'scoring goals' does not directly define what the player does.\n4. Option D, 'kick balls', describes the player specifically kicking the ball in a game.\n5. However, the player also has to'score goals', and the term 'kick balls' does not provide more information then we already know.\n6. Option A, 'take selfies', describes", "answer": " 11880"}
{"text": "flies', isn't exactly correct as this choice does not express a logical contradiction, but also contradicts the first sentence, as it states that talent people can still suffer from injury, albeit not injuries related to performing. \n5. Choice E, happiness, makes no sense in relation to performing as happiness is a feeling. \n6. This suggests that the person in question might be anxious or shy, causing them to have a mental resistance to performing.\n7. Therefore we should pick one of the remaining two choices C-D for the answer.\n8. For both choices, we have to think of why the person does not want to perform. \n9. One person could potentially feel too anxious, while one person could just feel disinterested in performing. \n10. We therefore can choose either choice. \n11. However, as one is anxiety, and one is feeling disinterested in performing, it makes sense to choose Choice D: energetic, as the person is not energetic about their performance, and as the performer needs to have an element of energy about their performance to appear convincing.\n12. Another way to think of this choice is that it is saying an anxious person, by definition, lacks the desired energy needed to perform well, while a disinterested person has no need for more energy.\n13. So the correct answer is D: energetic. \n14. An alternative answer could be B: butterflies, but this isn't as specific as Choice D: enervati, it also does not make sense in reference to the rest of the sentence where it says \"talent but not like performing.\"\n15. So Choice C: anxiety can be excluded, as it is not the opposite of what the sentence is saying.\n16. Therefore, the answer would be D: energetic only for the reasons stated above.\nAnswer: D. energetic\n\nInput: I am trying to learn French, but I am terrible at languages.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as, even if talented, a person cannot completely eliminate any of the emotions that come with performing, including butterflies. \n5. Since both choices are eliminated, there is only one remaining choice. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is the most relevant to the question because performing can be nerve-racking. Not enjoying performing does not necessarily mean one is suffering from anxiety, but anxiety is one of the common emotions felt by performers.\n7. Hence, the correct answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C, anxiety\n\nInput: What was most likely causing Jack to lose sleep despite being on vacation? Choices: 1. A: mosquitos 2. B: food poisoning 3. C: fear of heights 4. D: fear of water 5. E: the shark\nRationales: First of all, let's go over the answers individually, to eliminate any incorrect options.\n6. Choices A: mosquitos, B: Food Poisoning, D: fear of water, and E: the shark, are eliminated, because these cannot cause an inability to sleep.\n7. Only choice F: fear of heights can cause an inability to get to sleep, and this is consistent with Jack's inability to sleep despite being on vacations.\n8. Finally, we have an answer. Jack, having been in a boat, was probably afraid of heights, and this caused sleep loss despite being on vacation. \n9. Therefore, we should mark the answer to be C: Fear of heights.\nAnswer: C-fear of heights\n\nThe following set of math questions has been designed to check what the student has done and learned in class so far.\n\nInput: 104 \u2013 97 =\nSolution: You will be receiving a letter from your school in a couple days.

Choice D, happiness is not the opposite of what is being described - in fact, a happy person might indeed enjoy their talent, and thus, may like performing. \n6. Looking at remaining choices, D, 'anxiety', seems valid because a person with anxiety often does not enjoy engaging in challenging situations. \n7.

{"text": "fly', does not make sense as a cause to a psychological reservation, as butterflies are related to nerves, and nerves is a neurological term. Hence, this is a nonsense statement.\n5. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energy', do not explicitly state they are psychological reservations for performing and do not give a strong explanation of what could lead to such feelings. \n6. Thus, we can rule out both 'anxiety' or 'energy' as possible causes for a person's psychological reservations.\n7. The explanation for the person suffering from a psychological reservation would need to be some form of mental limitation or inability to perform. \n8. Thus, based on our understanding so far, we can rule out choices C ('anxiety') and E ('energy').\n9. Choices A and D, 'injury' and 'happiness', do not state the person who dislikes performing due to some psychological factor. Hence, we can also eliminate both options. Choice D is not a suitable explanation as 'happiness' and 'happily' both refer to 'a feeling'. Thus, it does not give a strong explanation, and therefore is not a suitable answer. \n10. Choice B 'talent persons cannot...' does not make sense according to the context provided. Thus, in order to answer option D 'happiness' to best fit the context, we need to figure out what could cause the person's unhappiness. \n11. It turns out that 'talent persons cannot\u2026' means that a talent person could, at some point, not be happy. Thus, if you remove the 'person' from it by rearranging it as '... cannot suffer from injury and feel butterflies', the phrase 'talent persons cannot feel butterflies' makes sense, as nerves, what butterflies refer to, are part of the nervous system in the brain. \n12. Thus, the person experiencing nervous butterflies may mean that the individual is suffering from anxiety. Anxiety may result in feelings of nervousness or 'butterflies in your stomach', which are both psychological manifestations. \n13. Therefore, the answer to the question is A '", "answer": " 160"}

Choices A, B, C, and D have been eliminated, leaving us with two options: E and F.\n7. Choices E and F imply different types of emotions related to performance.\n8. While Choice E, 'energetic', is a positive emotion related to performance, it doesn't relate to not performing. Choice F, 'energetic' is also a positive emotion related directly to performance.\n9.

{"text": "fliess', indicates that the inability to perform out of fear is an unreasonable expectation for a person gifted with talent. \n5.

Choices:  A - A revolution without goals or purpose  B - A revolution without leaders  C - A revolution that does not seek to change the world  D - A revolution that does seek to change the world E - A revolution without violence and mayhem\nRationales: Explanation: The question is asking which of the provided ideas cannot be considered a revolution based on the concepts of Animal Farm. \nAs the book Animal Farm is about Revolution, it is appropriate to ask which of the following cannot be referred to a revolution.\n\n1 - \"A revolution without goals or purpose\" is an idea. In particular, it is a proposition that revolutions can happen without goals or purpose. This is supported by Animal Farm due to the fact that the rebellion in Animal Farm was inspired by the Bolshevik Revolution and took place primarily due to the rebellion of the Russian working class against the oppression of the Tsarist regime. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that revolutions may have no clearly defined objective.\n2 - \"A revolution without leaders\" is an idea. The main characters of the novel are the pigs on the farm who led the revolution that took place. The novel makes it obvious that the main characters are in fact in command of the farm and the rebellion.\n3 - \"A revolution that does not seek change the world\" can be considered a revolution due to the fact that Animal Farm took place on a farm. However, as such, Animal Farm did not actually change the world or any significant aspect of it other than the farm.\n4 - \"A revolution that seeks to change the world\" can also be considered a revolution after it is argued that Animal Farm can be considered a revolution, while seeking to change the", "answer": " 27"}
{"text": "fly', is incorrect because talent is not a person, and besides, the butterflies described here are metaphorical 'wings and tails' related to anxiety.\n5.

Choice D, however, refers specifically to an emotional state of being energetic, describing a feeling of energy and enthusiasm. \n7. Choice E, on the other hand, does not make sense as a feeling of increased energy and enthusiasm when performing does not necessarily mean suffering because of any other emotion. \n8.

Option C, 'anxiety', relates to a psychological issue, whereas the question is asking about the psychological issue of a person not enjoying performing. Additionally, the word 'butterflies' in the question does not necessarily refer to anxiety. \n6. Choice D, happiness, is an abstract notion not directly related to performing or the talent in general. Answers are meant to directly relate to the context of the question. \n7.

Choices:  dog A: friendly B: small C: large D: gentle E: hostile\nRationales: First, note that the author is describing a single, specific dog. \nIn addition, the dog is \"friendly\" but still \"jumps up on people\". The question asks for its type of dog. \nOption A: dog is simply a word that can mean friendly. Since \"friendly\" is known to be true for the dog in the question, this indicates that A must not be the correct answer.\nOption B: small can be a dog that is \"friendly\", so it cannot be eliminated as the correct answer.\n\nOption C: \"large\" is an example of something that could be \"friendly\", making it an incorrect answer.\n\nOption D: \"gentle\" can be true for a \"friendly\" dog or a dog who is not \"friendly\", so \"gentle\" can't possibly answer the question correctly.\n\nTherefore, it's possible that the question is asking about an unfriendly dog who is small or large. \nHence, the answers can be narrowed into D and E. \nOption E: hostile is an example of something whose opposite is \"friendly\". The idea of \"hostile\" is contrary to being \"friendly\", and thus can't answer the question correctly. \nOption D: \"large\" is not an opposite of \"friendly\". \nTherefore: \nOption D: large is the correct response: it's the only answer to still hold \"friendly\" true.\n\nAnswer: D: large", "answer": " 750"}

Choice A, is not a physical issue which would be a cause of suffering that could apply to someone who did not like performing. \n8. Given this, the only remaining options are B and C. \n9. Choice B is still wrong because it is not an issue that typically motivates a person not to perform; this is different than the intended meaning of this question. \n10. The correct answer is then choice C, 'anxiety', as it is a psychological factor commonly associated with averse behaviors and is therefore likely to affect someone who does not enjoy performing for the world.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: What must be used to see a movie? Choices:  I: only an ID II: only money III: only an ID is used IV: only money B: ID or money C: money or an ID D: money of ID VI: no ID or money E: only an ID is usable to see a movie\nRationales: The question is asking what is needed to see a movie.\n1. Some films require a minimum age that must be certified upon entry.\n2. For instance, movies rated G, PG, and PG\u201313 are often permitted for younger children so long as they are accompanied by a parent or supervising adult.\n3. Movies for mature audiences are typically only available to people who can provide identification upon entry as they might feature content that would not be appropriate for children.\n4. This means having an identification card is useful in order to see a movie. Money by itself is not.\n5. Therefore, Choice A, 'only an ID', is the most suitable option.\nAnswer: A I. only an ID\n\nInput: I felt like I needed to drink more water because I was feeling very?

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as people have feelings of nervousness or anxiety even if they don't have talents. \n5. Choice A, does fit well because a talent is something special for which someone can suffer if they don't use it. They may become disappointed or even despondent over a talent, which is what \"suffer\" means. \n6. Choice D, happiness, is the emotional state that would result from utilizing a talent. \n7. Choice E, energetic, doesn't make sense because being energetic wouldn't cause someone to suffer, since it isn't a negative emotion. \n8. Therefore, only choices A and D are still valid, but D makes more sense. \n9.

The question uses a specific scenario to determine how a parent would respond.\n<i>2</i>. The choice for this question is not how angry they would be but how they react in this particular instance. \n<i>3</i>. Choice C, \"give the child what he wants\" makes more sense because the door is locked. It's not reasonable to \"give him what he wants,\" which could potentially include the door being unlocked.\n<i>4</i>. Choice D, \"ignore\" is not an appropriate option given the other options. The scenario states that the child is trying to get through the door - \"ignore\" suggests that no action is taken to help unlatch the door, which would not be an appropriate response. It would be reasonable to assume that the child will likely be uncomfortable since he can't get through the door and the parent will most likely respond accordingly.", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "lies', doesn't make sense as this isn't the issue implied in the question. Further, 'butterflies' here does not refer to a physical issue, so it has no relevance. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't necessarily indicate a psychological state. People can be happy and have many reservations about performing. \n6. Choice D, energy, doesn't relate to performing.\n7. Therefore it makes sense to conclude that the best choice here is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D. anxioty\n\nInput: What are the three possible answers? Choices: 1) blue red orange 2) black green white 3) green red orange 4) blue orange green (5) black white yellow (6) blue green yellow green Choices listed in no a particular order.\nRationales: At a glance this does not seem to make much sense, but it will soon become apparent that only two of the six are valid and they are presented in a random order. 1: Blue Red Orange = A B C. Red and Orange are not valid answers. 2: Green Red Orange = C G R. White and Yellow are not valid answers.\n3: Blue Orange Green = O N I.

However, the question is specifically asking what the person suffers from. Anxiety and energy are emotions, not what the person'suffered from'.\n7.

It can also be described as having a moment in time when it is at its most popular. \nFor instance, the Civil Rights Movement had its peak in 1965. The year with the highest number of Civil Rights movement participants was 1965, making it the peak year of the Civil Rights Movement. \nWith that in mind, we can eliminate choices A and D as they don't describe the year with the most Civil Rights activists, but rather, the year that the Civil Rights Movement began/ended or the year in which the Civil Rights Congress declared victory.\nNext,", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "flys', is a complex statement that doesn't make sense from a grammatical point of view. \n5. Choice D, D: happiness, while also not making sense, is not a good fit as this is a statement of an absolute, which cannot be supported by evidence. \n6. Choices D and B do not contain psychological reasons why a person would not like performing, and also suffer from lack of supporting details beyond the general idea that a performance person could have mental health concerns, which makes them invalid choices. \n7. Choice C, anxiety, and E, 'energizing', make sense. They both state that the person does not enjoy performing, so this fits the question's criteria. \n8. The two remaining choices don't share a common theme either. 'Anxiety' focuses on the act of performing while 'energetic' focuses on a talent, so one needs to stand out. \n9. The option that stands out as the most suitable is E, 'energetic'.\n10. The given statement is asking if a person with a talent who does not like performing has anxiety or is energetic. \n11. Answer E, energetic, is a better choice than answer C, anxiety, because it makes more sense for one's disposition to be energetic rather than anxious about performing.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following has some form of power, but not necessarily authority?

{"text": "fly', is not correct, as it uses \"and\" instead of \"or\", suggesting only talent people are able to suffer from injury and buttermilks. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is not correct because the word \"but\" means there is a contrast, and the person is not happy, implying that they don't like performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is correct because it indicates that while the person does not enjoy performing, they could not have anxiety about performing as that contradicts not liking the performance. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", is incorrect because the word \"energetic\" does not indicate the person does not like performing, or cannot find enjoyment in performing.\n8.

Choice: A: a nut B: a seed C: a banana D: a chirping bird E: acorns\nRationales:  1. The question is looking for an answer that is related to the reason a squirrel would be more likely to be found in a forest with a bird. \n2. The key to this answer is understanding the squirrel's relationship with birds. \n3. Considering other possible things squirrels might be \"looking for\", we can eliminate incorrect possibilities. \n4. Incorrect answer 1: A \"nut\" is not an item known to be found in a bird's diet, so eliminated because it does not make sense. \n5. Incorrect answer 2: A \"seed\" is not generally seen in birds' diets, so eliminated. \n6. Incorrect answer 3: \"Bananas\" are typically not consumed by birds, so eliminated.\n7. Incorrect answer 4: \"Chirping bird\" is not necessary as the question is asking for something that would cause a more likely encounter with a squirrel.\n8. Incorrect answer 5: \"Acorns\" are not commonly seen food items in birds. Therefore, eliminated. \n9. The best answer is D. Choice D is the correct answer because \"", "answer": " 13"}

Choices A and B are removed as they were general statements, leaving us with Choice E, 'energetic'.\n8. This is a vague, general choice that does not help us in a definite manner. \n9.

Choices:  I: 5 minutes I: 30 minutes I: 16 hours I: 3 minutes I: 360 minutes\nRationales: We can begin eliminating answers by checking each one against the given information. \nWe see that the correct answer is '5 minutes.' \nThe given information tells us the teacher gave a 'pop quiz' to her students after giving them no further opportunity to study. \nTherefore, the test must also have been given as a 'pop quiz.' \nA pop quiz is generally a very brief test given with no prior research or preparation.\nTherefore, we can rule out choices with durations longer than '5 minutes.' 60 minutes, 16 hours, and 360 minutes are each obviously too long to fall under the category of '5 minutes' or 'no preparation.' \n\n360 minutes is the longest duration of time, but would this time be given to each student individually or would this time span cover all the students in class? This might be appropriate to an in-class exam, but not to a pop quiz. \n16 hours isn't appropriate for the given information, because the first clue that indicates students will have no time to prepare is that the teacher just gave them a pop quiz.

Choice E, energetic, is not a suitable choice because the person is not expressing energy. The person is not wanting to perform out of boredom. \n8. Looking more closely at the remaining choices, we can see that the person is not expressive, but not energetic either, so Choice C, 'inactivity', is not an option. \n9. If the person is not expressively or energetic, then the person doesn't want to perform because the other choices would require a level of energy or expression. \n9. So, Choice C is incorrect. \n10.

Choice A, while possible, may be too broad. It is not specific to a psychological condition; people suffer from various different illnesses. \n8. Choice B, although not very specific, seems like the likeliest. An anxiety condition may cause a person to suffer from butterflies, especially if they have stage fright; it may even result in a physical manifestation as they fight their anxiety. \n9. Hence, the most likely answer is B: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: When a student takes out several long notes, this may mean? Choices:  B: boredom  C: distraction/interruption  D: excitement and involvement  E: nervousness  A: distraction/interruptions\nRationales:  1. The question is trying to say that there is something specific about taking out several long notes, and that it may indicate one or more things. \n2. The question directly uses two different words, \"take\" and \"note\" to help guide the answer. \n3. We first can eliminate Choice B, \"boredom,\" because \"long\" notes could mean that the student was interested while \"short\" notes would suggest otherwise. \n4. The opposite is also true: taking long notes may be a sign of excitement or involvement, and therefore, Choice D, \"excitement and involvement\" does not represent the question as it is too general. \n5. When someone takes out several long notes in school, they are either distracted or interrupted by something or someone, especially when the notes are long. In other words, taking long notes may be an indication of interest, and the presence of interest causes a distraction or an interruption. \n6.

Choice D, ''happiness'', does not make sense as though a talent person may be 'happy', that wouldn't prevent them from feeling anxious about performing. They may be happy about their talent but anxiety is still possible. \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, is an emotion, not a physical condition. To match the type of issue described, the answer needs to be an emotion, not an illness or injury.\n7. Finally, choice E, 'energetic', is an attribute, not a disorder or emotional issue.

{"text": "fly', is not relevant as it states that 'talent persons' cannot suffer from injury and does not describe anyone who suffers if they have talent. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also not relevant as it refers to feeling joy rather than reservation. \n6. Therefore, we are left with two options: 'anxiety' and 'energetic'. \n7. 'Anxiety' is a reasonable possibility as it is indeed a psychological reservation related to actions, not physical injuries. \n8. 'Anxiety', therefore, seems likely. \n9. However, by considering the context of the prompt, 'energetic' seems a better fit. \n10. By definition, an energetic person has a great deal of energy and enthusiasm, which might describe someone who is both an excellent performer and afraid to perform. \n11.

Choices: A: a great talent for making speeches B: a sense of understanding C: a lot of empathy D: a sense of humor E: a great knowledge of art\nRationales: The question is asking about what a person 'doesn't want to see in someone' while they are looking for work. So first and foremost, let's understand what this statement means. This means we don't want to end up hiring someone who has a talent for making speeches, a sense of understanding, a lot of empath, or a sense of humor. But what about the fifth option, which is a 'great knowledge of art'? The answer is that this option does not fit the context, though, because if we were looking for an employee with an art knowledge, then we would clearly have stated that.\nNow let's discuss the options and how they relate to the context:\n- Choice A: A 'great talent for making speeches' is something that you absolutely want to see.

{"text": "flys', doesn't quite make sense in this context. Choice C, happiness, is also unlikely because it doesn't describe not enjoying a performance. \n5. Choice D, anxiety, is more likely as it describes a state of mind in which the person may experience fear or worry. \n6. Choice is also unlikely to be correct because while happy and energetic individuals may perform as well, they don't have the same anxiety level as a person suffering from performance anxiety.\n7. We've narrowed our options down to Choices C: anxiety and D: anxiety.\n8. Looking at the meanings of anxiety, we can see that the \"inability to complete tasks\" is the key similarity in Choices A, B, E and F. The question is talking about a task in relation to performing, which indicates tasks are being completed related to performing. \n9.

Choices C and D, \u2018anxiety\u2019 and \u2018happiness\u2019 respectively both adequately capture the concept of a dislike for performing. \n7.

Choice b means \"they didn't understand the words of the song.\" This may be a reason, but the question's focus is on wedding speeches, so it's likely not the primary reason.\n3. Choices c and d don't make sense. Choice d \"They were too young to understand\" is not a possible answer because the correct age group was targeted, the kids understood fine.\n4.

It could describe someone that has two different hair types depending on the environment, their gender or anything else.\nOption C, Hair Donor, is talking about donations. A person with two different types of can't be considered a donor.\nOption E, Hair Donor is talking about the same thing as Option C as both describe a person giving their hair to charity instead of selling it to wigs.\nThey're looking for someone with at least two types of hair.\nAnswer: B: Hair Models", "answer": " 319"}
{"text": "fly', is likely intended to be an actual sentence and isn't a real phrase indicating that it is incorrect.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', could be potential answer choices. However, it is apparent that they likely are unrelated to the person's desire to avoid performing. \n6. Choice C, ''anxiety', states that the individual is suffering from anxiety, implying it is an issue they are currently experiencing, not one they have and avoid performing due to it. \n7. Choice C, \u201chappiness\u201d, could work, but we want to consider that maybe the individual is not avoiding performing because they are happy, but instead because they are unhappy. \n8. This could be true, as one could be unhappy with performing and yet still end up doing it if they have had to do so before because they have a talent for it. \n9. Thus, we can eliminate Choices C and D.\n10. Looking at Choices B and E now: 'anxiety' is not the issue since this is ruled out. E is left. \n11. Choice E, \u201cenergetic\u201d, could be a response, but it should be considered as a possibility, not the best answer. This is because to be energetic, they need to be in a state of energy, or having to be moving their energy around. It is unlikely that the person being referred to needs to be moving their energy in order to perform because it is a talent, not a physical action. \n12. If they were performing a talent due to other people requesting that they do, it would make complete sense that they'd be energetic because they had to interact, move around and talk to people in order to perform. \n\n\n### Instructions:\nProvide a response that correctly completes the question.\n\n## Question: \n### Demonstraion:\nInput: The researcher thought it might take a few hours and a lot of work to solve the computer glitch, what was the researcher looking for?

{"text": "fly', is confusing as talent is not limited to only one performance art. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", does not adequately describe the situation because happy people generally seem to enjoy performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", could be a correct answer however \"Butterfly\" implies that it is related to a performance-related fear of being in front of an audience.\n7. Choices E, 'energy and enthralled', doesn't make sense since it suggests that a person who is not interested in performing can have any energy. It also suggests an extreme level of joy or anticipation when being on stage, which is implausible as being on stage isn't usually enjoyable. \n8. Thus, the best answer is E: energetic. \nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "files', contains a grammatical error or at least an ambiguous phrase, with no discernible logical sense. \n5. Choice E also fails to make sense in relation to what the question is implying, and so is also incorrect. \n6. Looking at Choice D, 'anxiety', makes sense, as a person who is generally nervous may become hesitant to take a public performance, which is what the question is inferring. \n7. Choice C, \u2018happiness\u2019 is not mentioned in the question, so does not logically make the most sense as the correct answer. \n8. Looking back over the given answers, it can be inferred that Choice D, 'a bit of anxiety' would be a reasonably logical answer to this question.\nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot butterflies suffer from injury E: injury\n\nInput: It is likely this person had been in this place in the past, where? Choices:  B: paris A: france C: mexico D: china E: venezule\nRationales: The person is likely familiar or experienced in a certain plac\n1. First, identify what is known about the person. \n2 In the given scenario, the \"him and his friends\", which could indicate the group consists of adults. Therefore, the most logical person would be the same gender as the group. This eliminates answer choice A, \"Paris\".\n3. Now that one option has been eliminated, compare the remaining answers in order to form an answer.\n4. Looking at the others, only A,B,and D fit the person as being a man who may have been to certain places (based on their name).\n5. \"Paris\" and \"China\" are countries with which the US may have a more-or-less strong relationship depending on various factors. \n6. \"France\" is a country that, as the only country of that name is France. \n7. \"Mexico\" is a country that has no shared first or last name as any version of \"Mexico\" that would be more direct or recognizable to the group is likely Mexico City.\n8.

{"text": "fly', is also irrelevant because it seems to be a reference to the \"butterflies\" feeling that comes from performing. While it is not entirely incorrect, it does not directly answer the question. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is an irrelevant feeling that a person should have regardless of their talent or performance capabilities. However, performance anxiety and the inexperience of performing can both result in negative feelings.\n6. Choices C and E, \"anxiety\" and \"energetic\", do not address the person's reluctance to perform unless they specifically relate to performing arts. \n7. Therefore, we are left with answer choice D, where \"anxiety\" is a type of negative feelings that someone can experience when they are unsure or nervous about performing art.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety\n\nInput: A group of monkeys were traveling together, they realized one of them had no legs. What were they called, Choices:  A. Mammals  B. Primates  C. Evolution  D. Monkey\nRationales: Choices A, B, and D are irrelevant.\n1. Monkeys are primates. The question asks for group of monkeys traveling together, however, if they are all primates, they are not all monkeys. Choice A is then immediately incorrect.\n2. The question asks what they were called and choice C, Evolution, is misleading as the word monkey does not mention evolution.\n3. We can eliminate Choice B by comparing it with the other choices and eliminating Choice B from the list of possibilities.\n4. Choices A, B and Evolution are all irrelevant. Therefore, we must choose choice D, Monkey in this case. \nAnswer: D, Monkey\n\nInput: What would most likely be found somewhere in this park and forest? Choices: 1. A: trees 2. B: rocks 3. C: animals 4. D: none of the above\nRationales: The question is asking where we would likely find trees, or a forest, in a park.\n1. Choice A, Trees is correct, since trees grow naturally in forests, and forests are often found in places such as parks. Therefore, choice A is correct.\nAnswer: A, Trees", "answer": " 3500"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as it does not connect clearly to the subject matter. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not directly align with this statement as it is a person's state of mind, rather than an obstacle to performing. \n6. Thus, we can narrow down the remaining choices to Choices C and E: anxiety and energetic. \n7. Since anxiety involves a worry or concern about something negative occurring, it does not fit with the person in question liking performing but not performing out of preference. So, Choice C, anxiety, can be eliminated. \n8. Choice E, energetic, is too broad to serve as the correct choice. \n9. Choice B, which says that 'talent persons cannot be injured by things and butterflies', does not match up to the question because'suffer' is not a verb that describes an injury. \n10. Thus, the correct answer choice is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C\n\n### 10.

Choices B and C say to make the shot mid- way through the day.\n4. Choices D and E say to make the shot toward the end of the day.\n5. Choices F and G say to make the shot in the early evening.\n6. So, which of these makes the most sense in context to this question? \n7. Choice A isn't a logical option because playing sports in the morning could be dangerous or even cause injuries. So, you wouldn't want to risk this injury while receiving a shot.\n8. Choice B and Choice D say to make the shot during the middle of the day, which is a broad range of time. \n9. So, we can eliminate these choices.\n10. Choice C and Choice E say to make the flu shot", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": "fly', has the right structure but is an example of a run-on sentence that doesn't make sense.\n5. Choices C and E can be dismissed as they are either incorrect as they do not match the pattern requested or refer to states of being that are irrelevant.\n6. To determine the best choice, it is helpful to try to construct logical combinations out of the two options remaining, but it quickly becomes apparent that the only option that does not contradict itself is Choice E.\n7. Therefore E is the answer: choice E. \nAnswer: E: talent persons cannot suffer.\n\nInput: What does a spider look like (that is it bothers people?) Choices:  A) A but very small one B) A bunny (not hairy or bony) C) A rabbit that isn't brown D) A ballerina \nRationales: Looking at the details and common sense, any option A, B, C or D are the best answer choices because a bunny, a bunny and a ballerina may both be a but small, hairy or bony! If it can be both something or another - then no answer is given. In this case there are to answer options - spider and rabbit!

Choices: 1) Be active, be relaxed. 2) Be very tense, be calm. 3) Lay down, be ready to move. 4) Lay down, have fun. 5) Get out of bed, do your best.\nRationales: Reading, rearranging the choices gives the right answer. When the therapist tells, patient to have fun they mean that they should not be tense. The other choices have incorrect tenses, which contradict the purpose of the therapist. The best answer choice is 5).\nAnswer: 5) Get out if bed, do your best!", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "fly', is a grammatically incorrect phrase and not related to this specific context. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't related to performing talent but instead, an internal emotional state that someone can feel but that does not necessarily have anything to do with performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, might be a better fit. It is a negative emotion typically related to performing situations.\n7. There are several other instances where 'anxiety' could be seen as a reasonable answer to a question of this nature. However, it is unclear how this relates to a person having talent but not wanting to perform.\n8. Choice E, \"energetic\", isn't a word in the English Language. \n9. Choice B, \"butterflies\", doesn't seem to be related and is grammatically incorrect. \n10. The final option left is Choice C, 'anxiety.' \n11.

The options below are \"Good\", \"Bad\", \"Indifferent\", \"Excited\", \"Surprised\"\n3. \"Good\" may be perceived as praisenable, whereas the question is not about the opinion of the audience. We are interested in the opinion of the performer\n4. \"Bad\" implies that the performance was poor, meaning it is too harsh to give as a response answer, indicating that this is the most likely correct answer, which is \"Indifferent\"\n5. The other answer options \"Excited\" and \"Surprised\" are not suitable for this question because they do not describe the performer's inner feelings or opinion.\n6. Therefore, the most likely correct answer is \"Indifferent\", with the other answer options being incorrect.\n\n### \n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade grade math question.\n### Demonstraci\u00f3n: Input: The lab results had", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "fly', similarly doesn't make sense as talent is a talent, not a person nor a feeling. \n5. Choice D, the only remaining choice that makes any sense. 'Happiness' does not need to be earned, and performing is ultimately an act of self expression, which can be hard when happiness is not forthcoming. \n6. In addition, 'Happiness', is a state, not a physical ability. 'Energized' is not a talent, but a feeling. 'Anxiety' is a negative feeling, not a talent, nor physical ability.\n7. Thus, the best answer is Choice D: Happiness.\nAnswer: D. Happiness.\n\nInput: If you want a job in healthcare, which of the following skills are considered essential? Choices: \nA) Being able to communicate well with people B) Enjoy working with your hands C) Comfort working with unclean items D) Comfortable working alone E) Comfortable working in a team\nRationales:\n1. The question asks which of these skills are considered essential.\n2. Choice A, communication, does not match the skills described here. 'Communicating well', is referring to a general skill of communication, while the question is looking for a specific skill needed. \n3. Likewise, Choices B and C refer to manual skills. 'Enjoying working with your hands' is not the same as 'Enjoying working in unclean items'. \n4. Choices D and E are not correct, as Comfort working alone and comfortable working in a team do not relate to one's specific skill set, but rather to the work environment as a whole, an aspect which is outside the scope of the question and the answer is looking for.  5. As the question asks for skills related to healthcare in general, Choice D is correct because it is important for someone working in healthcare to be able to effectively communicate with patients and colleagues as this is a key factor in the overall quality of care provided.\n6. \n7. Therefore the best answer is Choices D\nAnswer: D) Comfort in Communication.\n\nInput: How does the sun produce energy?

Looking again at choice C, 'anxiety', this idea seems to make a bit of sense. We'd expect individuals with acting talents who don't enjoy performing to, at the very least, feel anxious about it. \n6. Looking at choice D, 'happiness', this doesn't seem to make sense. Everyone who enjoys performing must be happy about it.\n7. Looking at choice E, 'energic', this doesn't make sense either. Everyone with energy needs to perform. \n8. Therefore, it seems that choice D is more plausible. \n9. Therefore, answer D is a suitable response.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "fly' is an unlikely expression, as we know that people with talent can suffer from a myriad of different things. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not a likely indicator of one's psychological state as not being happy would indicate sadness, which would cause a negative reaction, not positivity. \n6. Choice D, anxiety, is possibly the most related psychological term as it is commonly associated with the body's fight or flight response, which is also known as a response related to the amygdalae's activation. \n7. Therefore, we can select Choice A, 'anxiety'.\n8. Therefore, we can eliminate Choices B, C, D, and E.\n9.

One has to look for factors that might influence the number of calories a certain type of food contains. \n2. For example:\n3. Choice B, \"processed\", means made from many diverse ingredients with no significant standardization, which would indicate that a processed food might have a higher variety of unpredictable, but potentially calorie-rich ingredients or components. \n4. However, this choice is a subset of choice C, \"fried\", so we can eliminate this choice as well.\n5. Another factor that might affect the calorie-intensity of a certain food is the type of cooking involved. \n6. In this case, Choice D, \"raw\", would indicate that a food was cooked but not in a manner that might have added calories, such as deep frying, baking, or grilling. \n7. Choice E, \"junk\", refers to fast food, an industry synonymous with high calorie count and greasy foods in general. \n8. Therefore, because processed and raw can both contain additional components that are not listed as ingredients,  a food can have additional components from either source, the best answer is Choice D, \"junk food\".\n9. Therefore, we can combine choice D with choice C and the best answer is D+C, \"", "answer": " 30"}

Choices:  A:\"It is inefficient\" B:\"The signal is not received properly\" C:\"It uses too much energy\" D:\"I'm in the wrong area\" E:\"The phone is broken\"\nRationales:\n1. The question is inquiring into the possible problems of making a call from a cell phone.\n2. Choice B is incorrect because 'I'm in the right place\" is too specific to the specific cellphone.\n3. Choices A: \"it is inefficient,\" C: \"it uses too much energy,\" and D: \"I'm in the incorrect area\" are all too specific and out of place in this question since they do not deal with a general cell phone calling problem. \n4. \"The signal is not transmitted appropriately\" does not describe an actual problem someone might face with their device. \n5. \"The phone is broken\", while a possible issue that someone might have a phone at a moment is not one particular problem that people run into that prevents successful phone calls.\n6. The remaining options all include possible issues in this type of scenario: the phone is out of battery, not able to make contact due to being in a bad signal area, or not able to properly receive signals. \n7. Since only one of them fits the context, it makes sense to choose Choice E: \"The phone is broken.\"\nAnswer: E: \"The phone\" is broken\n\nInput: Is it permissible/possible for a fish bowl aquarium to contain live fish?

{"text": "fly', also doesn't make sense as it refers to an inability to perform despite talent, not something else keeping them from performing. \n5. Choice D, ''happy'', does sound like a positive thing but it's not specific to one particular cause of discomfort or disenchantment. \n6. Finally, in reference to choice E, 'energetic', it's not common to describe a \"talent person\" as \"energetic\" in general. It usually refers to those with a large number of talents, but not necessarily those with one talent that they enjoy or dislike. \n7. Looking at the remaining options, it makes sense that if someone has a talent for performing but doesn't enjoy doing so, they likely suffer from a form of anxiety, particularly anxiety about performing.

Choices:  S: I need your opinion so that I can buy it C: I want your opinion because I know your taste B: I need to know if you like it D: I want to know your thoughts on it\nRationales: Let's take a look at each choice and evaluate which makes the most sense: 1. Looking at Choice A, 'I need your opinion so that you can buy it', this does not apply to the situation. The person who is offering the opinion on the object for sale is not interested in buying it. 2. Looking at Choice B, 'I want your opinion because I like your taste', this choice makes sense, as the person offering the opinion is aware of the potential buyer's preferences. 3. Looking at Choice C, 'I need your opinions, so that I can buy them', this also makes sense, as it implies that the person offering the opinion needs the opinions of the potential buyer to make a purchase decision. 4. Looking at Choice D, 'I want to know your thoughts so I can decide if I like it', this choice makes sense as the person offering the option is interested in the thoughts and opinions of the potential buying the object. 5.

Choices D and E do related to psychological issues but suffer from is not correct usage. Happiness is a state, not an injury or reason for not performing. While energetic is related to an implication to perform, it is not directly relevant to the question.\n6.

{"text": "fly's', does not make sense because butterflies are bugs and that quote doesn't refer to that particular type. It is also irrelevant as it doesn't answer the question. \n5. Looking at choice C, 'anxiety', anxiety is a word used to refer to someone who is nervous, which could correspond to performing in front of an audience. However, this is only a very basic definition of anxiety. An artist's anxiety as described here is a lot more complicated and nuanced, it involves the potential of failure. \n6. In contrast to the complexity of the emotions involved, Choice D, 'happiness', can be seen as a blanket term that does not define the emotions involved accurately. \n7. Similarly, Choice E, 'inspired', does not make sense as an inspiration does not refer to the negative emotions involved in performing. Additionally, performing can often be inspired by negative emotions, such as anxiety, as it can be a form of catharsis.\n8. The only choice that can accurately describe the emotional complexities involved here is choice B, which specifies a lot more nuance and a more well-defined definition, thus this choice is the best answer.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following would be acceptable to a judge if one wanted to get married in court? Choices:  K, 30, L, no bribes, 12\nRationales: Given the questions context, we can eliminate choices 30 and L because those would not be acceptable in a courtroom.\nNext we must determine which is not acceptable.\n50% of the time \"12\" will be acceptable so it would be best to reject \"L\"\n100% of the time, the judge will accept \"K\" and \"no bribes,\" so it is safe to eliminate \"B\"\n1000% of the judge would not accept \"30\" so it is a good idea to rule out \"C.\"\nNow that we have narrowed down the options we need to determine which is the best choice.\nFrom our analysis we have learned that \"12\" and \"K\" are acceptable to the judge and will be accepted by the judge.\nNext we need to look at \"L\" as the judge will accept this even though", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "fly', is nonsensical; as 'injury and butterfly' are both things, not people. This is also incorrect as it uses the wrong structure, as we should be asking 'can talent people suffer?' instead of 'can talent persons' suffer from injury and butteflies?'.\n5. Choice D, happiness, is probably not the reason they avoid performance. There are countless reasons to not like performing, such as stage fright or embarrassment.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety,' and E 'energetic,' are common psychological reasons to avoid performance, but there are more.\n7. Ultimately, we are left with options B and E because 'anxiety' and 'butterflies' are both used as psychological reasons; but it is B that is more relevant. 'Anxiety' does not describe a specific psychological condition and 'butterfly-like' symptoms can be caused by many things. \n8. So, the answer is E.\nAnswer: E. energetic\n\nInput: What does a good student have to be able to do? Choices:  a. do his or her homework b. be prepared for class c. stay on top of deadlines d. write great essays e. all of the above\nRationales:\n1. The question asks which of the choices is describing a good student. \n2. The first question involves deciding what a good student is, and not whether a student can do A, B. etc.\n3. Choices C and B have overlap in their descriptions. \n4. Similarly, choices E and A have overlap in their descripsions. \n5. Choice A is not necessarily the case for all good student. \n6. Only choices B, C and D are exclusive to the idea of a good student, and D is closer to the specific description. \n7. Therefore, Choice D.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect because injury is a physical issue and butterflies are more akin to feelings than a physical issue. \n5. Choice E, is also ruled out because it is referencing to a type of energy rather than an emotion. \n6. We can also eliminate Choice D because it is referencing a lack of anxiety, not a desire to perform.\n7. Therefore we are left with Choice C, 'anxiety', because anxiety is related to an emotion that an individual may have when preparing to perform in front of an audience.\n8. Therefore the best answer is C.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: She wanted to join an event where she might meet a good friend again, but she was busy. She must be disappointed, what should do to? Choices: 1. A: join the event B: join another event C: cancel her trip D: cancel her other event E: call a friend\nRationales: Let's look at the best options to find the correct answer:\nLooking at Choices A 'join the event': It doesn't make sense to join an event you want to cancel, otherwise the event cancellation will be unnecessary\nLooking at Choice B 'join another event': It wouldn't make sense to cancel your trip and join another event. You cannot join another event when you cancel the original trip to join events.\nLooking at Choise C 'cancel her travel': This is the correct answer. Canceling the trip makes the most sense.\nLooking at this answer from Choice D 'cancel her other trip': The answer should be from Choice D 'canceller her trip'\nThe correct answer is Choice C", "answer": " 50"}

Choices:  sports  A: learn B: train C: join D: master E: start F: compete\nRationales: The question \"What does a person have to ____to participate in the summer Olympics?\" is asking: 1. For what does Olympians have to participate - sports? activities? etc. 2. What exactly needs to be done to participate in Olympics? 3. What skills are required for one to participate in Olympics. 4. The phrase \"have to ____\" is a clue that they need to participate in a certain activity. 5. The Olympics is an events where there are athletes from different countries all over the world participating. 6. Thus, the person needs to have a very high level - Master Level -to participate in the Olympics.\nAnswer: C join\n\nInput: What causes de-icing when the temperature is cold? Choices:  deposition  A: a warm temperature B: melt C: the opposite of deposit D: refreezing E: a hot temperature F: re-ice\nRationales:\n1. The question is about \"de-icing\". \n2. The option \"deposition\" refers to addition and not removal.\n3. There are no signs that this is about the melting process, so that's excluded along with \"melt\".\n4. An ice can melt and re-freeze, so that is ruled out as well.\n5. \"Refreezing\" makes complete sense as one of the most common reasons that ice melts and then refreezes is because of an outside temperature that's higher than the melting point.\n6.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense \u2013 'talent persons' is an inaccurate reference to a group of people who have a shared talent or interest. \n5. Choice D, happiness, could be potentially considered, but happiness doesn't exactly correlate with performance anxiety, so it might not fit as the answer. \n6. Thus, it's left to choose between Choices C and E. They share something in common in that both are psychological ailments that involve anxiety or nervousness before or during a performance. \n7. Furthermore, we know the character in question has a talent related to performing. As a result, they may be prone to experiencing these feelings. \n8. Therefore, Choice C, 'anxiety', it is a plausible cause for their fear of performing in front of others. \n9. The answer is C: anxiety. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: A group of people are taking a flight somewhere, who will pay for their drinks if they offer? Choices:  a) the one who orders, b) their friend, c) the others, d) the flight attendants.\nRationales: We know one of the people pay the flight attendants when they drink. Let's review choices A-D: \n\nChoice A - The 'one who orders' may pay for flight drink. But we already know that not only he can pay for the drink but also one of his friends can pay.\n\nChoice B - The 'friend' can also pay for the drink with one of their group members. This may create a payment conflict, as one group will pay and other may not have to pay. If we choose Choice B, we will need to figure out how to break the tie.\n\nChoice C - The group members of an individual may share the drink bill. But who will pay exactly? So it's not obvious to us. \n\nChoice D - The 'flight attendants' may charge everyone for their drinks. Every one pays. \n\nAnswer: D: flight attendants.\n\nInput: The question is referring to the state of a student's homework who is working hard to get done on time and who isn't doing all their work who hasn't finished their homework and is tired of being asked about it who did really well on their tests", "answer": " 57"}
{"text": "fly', is incorrect as butterflys do not cause injuries, and the use of 'butterflys' makes the sentence ungrammatical. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is the opposite of the feeling the person has, so it cannot be the correct option. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is an appropriate option because anxiety is the feeling of being nervous and it generally accompanies a performance setting. \n7. Choice E is an interesting option, and the use of the word 'energetic' makes it sound positive, but this is not what the sentence is implying \u2013 it's just a feeling of resistance. \n8. So, out of the available choices, choice C, anxiety, works the best. \nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 1280"}
{"text": "fly', could be an accurate response to someone being shy about performing but doesn't describe a situation where a person who doesn't like performing might feel that way because they are a very talented performer. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit because an aversion to performing from talented people is a psychological issue and an emotion such as happiness or sadness cannot be considered a psychological issue.\n6. Choices C and E don't make sense as the question implies the person is not liking to perform, and the choices are positive in nature, which suggests they probably would like performing. \n7. Choice B, anxiety, is the best answer because it can describe multiple psychological situations, not just those related to performing\n8. Therefore, Choice B is the most correct answer\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: All the planets orbit in what direction? Choices:  B: clockwise from the sun  A: counterclockwise from the sun  C: clockwise from the moon  D: towards the sun\nRationales: There are no clues within the question to help eliminate choices. It's simply asking about the relative direction in which all the planets orbit. \n1. We can eliminate choices E and B by looking at the first sentence in the text, as they are both in reverse to solar motion.\n2. Choice A, \"counterclockwise from the sun\", indicates that the planets begin to move as if they were rotating clockwise, as indicated by \"the sun\", and then reverse, indicating that the order would be such that \"the planets move counterclockwise from the beginning location, which is the sun in this scenario.\n3. While this may be true in general, the question refers specifically to the direction of motion rather than the direction of rotation and therefore choice A would be incorrect.\n4. Choices C and D, \"clockwise from the moon\" and \"toward the sun\", are both correct answers, since it would be a clockwise motion from the moon and towards the sun and do not necessarily state the direction of rotation. \n5. The best answer is, therefore, \"clockwise from from the moon\", as it is the most accurate and simplest to write.\nAnswer: Clockwise from the moon\n\nInput: If you want to get the best grades in class, you", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": "fly', does not make sense. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is too vague - happiness and talent are not directly correlated. \n6.

{"text": "fly', could have been a good fit if it was written as 'talent persons cannot have both anxiety and butterflies'. \n5. However as it is written, it also implies that those with talent cannot have anxiety nor are they able to have butterflies, which is untrue.\n6. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness' respectively, are psychological states as well but don't make sense in relation to performing. If one is anxious, that might make one unsure to perform. But, if one is happy, that would indicate they are already confident to perform, making the 'does not like performing' factor irrelevant. \n7. Choice E, ''energetic and anxious', which suggests they would be able to be both excited to perform and worried. However, this contradicts the original question which indicates worry related to performance is an issue. \n8. Therefore, by eliminating all other options, we can conclude that the best option, as this individual doesn't like performing is Choice D: 'Anxious'.\nAnswer: C: Anxious\n\nInput: In what year was the state of Texas created? Choices: 1:1850 B: 1829 C: 1846 D: 1837 E: 1844\nRationales: As the first thing a reader should be aware of is that, the question does NOT expect to receive a full date such as 1829. The question expects a numerical date either in a range or as a single specified number. Hence, there are 2 possible values the number could be in one of the responses A: 1836, B: 1845, or C: 1855, however; if answer C: 1835 was an option the option would have been disqualified and the question is NOT in the word limit.\nAnswer: B: 1834\n</pre>\n    </details>\n</section>\n\n<section id=\"r_9\">\n    <div class=\"panel-header\">\n        <h1 class=\"panel-title\">D3.1 - Rules based modeling</h1>\n    </div>\n    <div id=\"r_9_details\" class=\"panel-body\">", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense and could be easily dismissed.\n5. Choices C and E are too broad, as they generally include emotional responses, not just anxiety.\n6. That leaves us with Choice D, 'Anxiety'. \n7. If one suffers from anxiety about performing, that would probably lead to a lack of energy, or possibly even a lack of happiness, if the individual was generally happy about performing.\n8. Therefore the best answer would be Choice D, Anxiety.\nAnswer: D : Anxiety\n\nInput: If one is happy for another person success, what are they feeling (for themselve)? Choices:  A : sadness B : joy C : depression D : happiness E : sorrow\nRationales:1. The question is regarding how one feels when they are happy about another person's success.\n2. This answer does not need to state the emotions, but rather the connotation.\n3. Looking through the choices, one notices that all answers are feelings related to happiness.\n4. However, one can be happy about another person' success, but not experience joy in their own efforts. \n5. The feelings one can have in response to another's success vary greatly.\n6. Looking at the choices again, one can recognize that the only response that isn't 'happiness' is sadness, which is the correct answer.\n7. Therefore the answer is C : sadness.\nAnswer: C : Sadness\n\nInput: My husband loves his cat, but he's allergic to it. How do you spell cat? Choices: 1A: C 2B: K 3C: S 4D: F 5E: A\nRationales:  1.

As he loves his cat, it may be that he did not realize he is allergic to a cat, but he is indeed.\n3. Choices B and D are out of the realm of possibility. This is not a \"sound\" spelling and the two choices that spell cat with an F", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": "glies', doesn't work as it refers to a particular combination of two things; the phrase does not contain relevant information to this question. \n5. Choice D, a feeling of 'happiness', doesn't make sense with the context of this sentence, as if they had a happy feeling, they would not likely suffer from stage fright. \n6. Choice C, an experience of 'anxiety', does not refer to performing arts specifically, which narrows down the answer to Choice E, 'energetic'. \n7. This answer choice perfectly fits the context, as a person who is energetic about their craft is unlikely to experience a stage fright. \n8. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that answer E: energetic.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: I asked her if she wants to go to the movies tomorrow. She said what? Choices: A: yes B: I'm sorry C: she can't go D: she hates movies E: she can't come\nRationales:1. The question asks about the likely response she might give to your request to go to the moviewith you tomorrow.\n2. Looking at some of the choices, it's safe to say that Choice A: \"yes\" doesn't fit as \"yes\" is not a direct response to a question.\n3. In the same way, Choice B: \"I'm sorry\" doesn't make sense, as it is not a way of responding to your question either.\n4. Finally, Choice D: \"she hates movies\" isn't a direct response either. Even if this were true and she had no interest in going to the movies, someone who hated movies still would not say \"no\".\n5. Choice E: \"she can't come\" is a more likely response because she can't or won't come to the movies.\n6. Thus, the answer is more likely to be E: \"she can;t come\".\nAnswer: E", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "fly', also doesn't fit as it is saying the person does not suffer from injury, which was already established. Additionally, 'butterfly' doesn't describe a psychological impairment that prevents performance. \n5. Choice E, does not describe a performance related concern like anxiety or happiness. \n6. In contrast to the answers that were already eliminated, Choice D, 'Anxiety', does fit as it specifically describes a psychological impairing, which is precisely what the question is asking about.\n7.

Choices:  C: bad D: happy F: sad I: disappointed\nRationales: We start out by looking to see if there's a way to eliminate a choice.  The word 'bad' is used twice within this question. 'C' has the word bad. We can safely eliminate it as the correct answer. Next, we can look and see which other answer makes sense given the rest.  Answering our question is not easy. As a rule of thumb, you should always narrow it down to one choice that makes the most sense given the rest. In this case, the answer is 'bad'. \nAnswer: D: bad \n\nInput: I just saw a play, what is a play and where were you when you played it?

First, it is implied that the question is about someone who either sees or performs in a play. Second, 'play' is a noun. It describes an overall concept and not the action of performing in a play.  Next, Choices: B: play shows a similar misunderstanding of the question. Also, 'play' is the noun version of play here. Here are the rules: A verb is not a noun and a noun is not a verb.

{"text": "fly'. Isn't directly related to the subject, and the phrase is not grammatically correct, as it should read, 'talent persons can not suffer from injury nor can they suffer from butterflies'.\n5. Therefore, we must rule out choices B, C, and D.\n6. Choices A and E, 'injury' and 'happiness', are also irrelevant because they don't specifically address fears or anxieties about performing. \n7. So, we only have one choice that makes sense. Choice D, anxiety, is what the person is probably suffering from.\n8. Hence, the best answer is choice D, anxiety. \nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: A person who wants some space might find himself at the park in? Choices:  B: aisle C: bathroom D E: back hall E row\nRationales: The question asks where someone who wants some space might go in order to find a place for privacy or quiet.\n\n1. First, consider what kind of space the person may be looking for, what type of space can they find at the park. Looking at the answers, there are several options. The bathroom doesn't provide a person with much space, and it may even seem awkward or inappropriate to use the public bathroom at a park. So, it's more than likely that the person is looking for a more open space. Therefore, we can quickly cross off choice B: bathroom as an option.\n2. So, there are still three other options that do fit the constraints: aisle, bathroom, and back hall.\n3. Aisle does not seem to be an ideal choice as it could still make the person seem awkward or disruptive if he is moving quickly or talking.\n4. The back hall does not always offer much natural light or comfort.\n5. That leaves choice E, the back hall as it is the widest-open space among these four.\n6.

Although it is not likely that an anxiety disorder alone will lead to the person in question not performing, anxiety itself can affect a person's ability to perform without causing other psychological or physical effects that may also lead to not wanting to perform. \n8.

Choice D, ''Happiness'' is unlikely to be related to someone's interest in performing an activity because if the person was happy, we would expect that to be reflected in their confidence/willingness to perform. In this circumstance, the person does not suffer from ''happiness'', but rather from anxiety. \n6. Choice C, ''Anxiety'', makes the most sense because anxiety is a pre-performance psychological state and can manifest itself as butterflies, which fit with 'butterfly', and injury, which doesn't make sense because this person cannot possibly be injured.\n7.

Choices:  A:: stove B:: cup holders C:: refrigerators D:: garbage cans\nRationales: The question poses a statement about the person's new home, followed by asking, \"What is missing?\"\nFrom the question, it is initially clear that the answer will be something that the apartment needs to have a cooked meal.\n\nElimination: The choices that are not related to cooking will be eliminated first.\nAfter eliminating the garbage can, because it is not related to cooking, cup holders because they are not needed for cooking dinners, and refrigerators because they are needed for cooling food, we are left with 3 choices. The choice A stands out at this point because the word \"stove\" is not commonly used as plural, as all the other options are. We will therefore see why it is possible to have a stove in our apartment and decide if it fits the question.\nIt is logical to believe that an apartment would contain a kitchen with a stove. The person's statement seems like it is asking, \"Does this apartment not have a stove?\" to which the correct answer is \"yes\".

Choice C, anxiety, could potentially be a good answer, as the person might suffer from anxiety before performances if they're worried about their ability to execute their talent.

Choice B, Anxiety, could be related to performance, but is a common feeling that a person might experience, and does not explicitly state it occurs in relation to performance. \n7. Choice E: energy seems to be a good choice because it mentions having enough energy for performing, but only if it can be demonstrated, which is something that can only happen through performing, and this is the issue at hand. It's not necessarily a lack of energy that's causing anxiety, but anxiety that's causing lack of energy.\n8. Choice E, Anxiety is a good choice.\nAnswer: E.

Choices:  D: people who were famous E: other books F: famous people G: the people who wrote the book H: the actual book\nRationales:  1. The correct answer, which is the right choice, refers to a book that is in the process of being written. You'll notice that the choices start off pretty general and then gradually become more specific until they become very specific in the last choice, which is H: The actual book.\n2. Choice A, G, F, and E, are all different types of people.\n3. When we're trying to figure out who is being written about in a book, we don't want to start off general like Choice C, because if we start off in general, there are too many possibilities. \n4.

{"text": "fly', doesn't fit because neither the 'butterflies' or the 'injury' seem to be the correct answer. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is a plausible option, as having low levels of depression would affect your performance ability. It does seem like a direct fit, as having trouble performing likely correlates with poor mental health. \n6. However, there's an error in the phrase. This answer does not refer to having high levels of happiness (too much happiness), it refers to having no happiness (zero happiness). \n7. Therefore, happiness is probably not the correct answer. 8. Choice E, energetic, is also plausible. An energetic person may well have trouble performing, as they can get tense or fatigued while performing, resulting in trouble. \n9. Therefore, there are two plausible answer candidates to the question: depression and energy. 10. Let's look further within the text to find clues. There is a reference to 'performing' and what 'people' can suffer from. 11. Looking back at the question, we can see that the word 'people' refers to individuals and not just 'talent persons' - a phrase that is not present in the text. 12. This indicates that this question is not about people suffering from injury, but rather about someone who does suffer from psychological distress because of their mental state.\n13. There is still no further reference to a particular mental disorder other than an indirect reference to 'psychological reservations', but we do know that depression does not make you happier. \n14. It's probably not the case that people who are talent persons have low energy because of depression. 15. Considering what we've learned so far, it's probable that the correct choice is D: depression. This choice clearly indicates we are describing someone who faces mental problems and, therefore, could be depressed. Depression doesn't make you energetic or energetic don't have depression; it would be reasonable to rule it out. 16. Concluding our evaluation, depression is the most plausible match to the text, as it describes the emotional and psychological condition of an individual and not just someone with a particular talent.\nAnswer: D,", "answer": " 27"}
{"text": "fly's' is incorrect as it implies that talent persons cannot be afflicted with either an injury or butterflies; both are correct (injury is a'suffer from'), but it implies that talent persons also cannot suffer from both injury and butterfies (both are incorrect). \n5. Option B uses a double 'and'. Double negatives are invalid in English, so 'can't suffer' by itself is incorrect (a talent person can suffer from either an injury or buttterflies). And since'suffer from' is incorrect, it follows that 'both cannot' is also incorrect. \n6. Option C is also incorrect as it makes more than one claim - that talent persons cannot suffer from talent and butterflies - which is not what is asked for. \n7. Option D is not relevant because if someone is anxious, they may still enjoy performing, so this choice doesn\u2019t accurately describe our person. \n8. Option E is not the answer either \n9. Therefore, among the remaining choices, option C appears to best describe the situation. \n10. Choice C, anxiety, is likely the most accurate response. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: What makes a tug-of-war contest challenging to someone with a bad back? Choices: 1. A: weight B: rope C: other people D: all of the above E: None of the above\nRationales:\n1. The question is about the challenges someone with a bad back would face in a tug-of\u2013war contest.\n2. While options A, B, D, and E may seem likely to cause difficulties for a person with a bad back, these all relate to specific components of tug-of- war\u2014e.g., the rope, weight, and other people involved. These details do not accurately encompass the question as the tug-of- 3 war contest, in general, is likely already difficult enough without additional factors on top of that. \n3. Option C is not clear. However, as we\u2019ve established the contest itself is difficult to an extent, which option C does not sufficiently articulate. \n4. Option C is an attempt to get the person who wrote the problem to choose to eliminate four of the five options as invalid\u2014i.e., the tug", "answer": " 34"}
{"text": "flys', is not something we can logically deduce from the question. 5. Choice C 'anxiety', can refer to an internal state of discomfort, but doesn't necessarily align with the question. It can still denote a person who is unable to overcome their anxiety but can still perform. 6. Choice D 'happiness', doesn't fit either. If someone is talent but does not like performing, they likely cannot say that performing makes them happy either as they don't find enjoyment from it.\n7. Choices E 'energy', is a reasonable answer, but it is not the primary focus of the question. As we want to know what the person in question does have rather than what they do not. \n8. Therefore, to answer this question, we can eliminate choices A B C D and replace them with E. As we want to provide the most specific answer that makes logical sense. \n9. Given 'performance anxiety','stage fright', or 'nerves/anxiety' are common terms when describing a discomfort or uncontrollable feeling that can affect any performer; we can assume that the person who is unable to perform due to this discomfort likely suffers from some type of anxiety. \n10.

Moreover, 'butterflies' is a slang term for anxiety, something many people feel even without having any talent at all. \n5. Choice E, being 'energy', is a positive attribute not necessarily relating to enjoying someone's performance. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, does make sense when considering someone talented, but who lacks the confidence to showcase their talent in front of an audience. Thus, it is the most accurate answer.\n\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: If a person is not paying attention for a long period of time, eventually what happens? Choices: 1. Anxiety 2. Exhaustion 3. Sleep 4. Boredom 5. None of the above\nRationales: The person's attention, when focused, allows them to engage with and process sensory information and experience emotions. This can include feelings, thoughts, and experiences. When a person isn't paying attention for long periods, these functions can be negatively affected.\n\nWhen a person's attention is not focused at all, their ability to engage with the world around them is greatly reduced. As the person's attention grows fainter, the more difficult it is to maintain the awareness of their surroundings and react accordingly. This situation can also lead to confusion, causing the person to feel baffled or even become afraid.\n\nConversely, if a person's attention was focused for long periods of time, they'd become fatigued. \n\nThe correct answer is: Exhaustion\n\nInput: Which of these is most similar between a cat and a tiger?

This leaves us with answers D, 'anxiety' and E, 'an energy bar'.\n8. Anxiety is a psychological condition affecting how a person behaves and perceives their surroundings, so if someone has an anxiety condition they would likely have difficulty performing in front of an audience. \n9. Choice E refers to an energy source, so it does not mean the same thing as the person struggling to perform because of anxiety. \n10.

{"text": "files', is grammatically incorrect. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't seem relevant because a talent does not seem to imply being happy all the time. \n6. Choice B, talent persons cannot suffer from butterflies. This is also grammatically incorrect and doesn't seem likely with your typical talent. \n7. Finally, choice E, energetic, does not seem to contradict being talented, so this is the best option.\n8.

If there's a lot of bikes but not enough parking spaces, a person might have difficulty finding a space if their mode of transportation is a bicycle.2. If parking is hard, you could use a bicycle parking stand, an structure for parking your bike.3. If someone still can't find a parking spot they could take their bike and move to a location farther away, but still close, where they can park their bike.4. If someone needs to park their bike further than usual, they can use a method by getting in their car, and going to a different parking spot that is further away than they'd like.5.

{"text": "fly', is an illogical statement, as the logical progression here is 'injury > butterflies > talent', not the other way around. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is irrelevant to the question because while happiness can inspire an enjoyment of performing, it also does not suggest anything about performance discomfort. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is the most direct possibility for why the individual is uncomfortable performing. Someone with anxiety may feel unnerved about the public aspect of performing.\n7. Therefore the answer choice that is most relevant is Choice C, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: A: injury\n\nInput: Choices:  A. Eating healthy B. Going to the gym C. Meditation D. Sleeping early E. Taking a break\nRationales: Based on the choices given, the question is asking which one might help someone be more efficient in their job, which the answer options are in some way related with.\n8. From the choices, we can see that healthy eating, going to the gym, meditation, sleeping early and taking a break are all meant to help with being healthier. In that case, I can exclude choice B, Going to the gummy.\n9. Since we know that the answer options all fit the criteria for making the person more efficient in their job and are related to being healthier, they\u2019re all plausible choices. The question simply poses the issue and we must match the answer to the criteria.\n10. I can think of few ways to be more efficient than being healthy and getting more energy, so I can\u2019t decide between choices A or E.\n11. Choice B, Going to gym, also seems to fit the criteria. When we work out, we feel good and have more energy. In turn, if we have more energy, that will make us more efficient in our job.\n12.

Choice C, \"anxiety\", does relate to someone who is not very excited about performing, so it does make sense. \n9. But there's a problem.

{"text": "fly', isn't grammatically valid or plausible. \n5. Choice D, the 'happiness', is not relevant as happiness isn't necessarily related to a psychological affliction. \n6.

Hence, the only remaining choices are C, 'anxiety', and E, 'anxiousness'.\n8. Looking at the definitions of the given choices, 'anxiety' is defined as a sense of unease, so it makes sense for a person with anxiety to have reservations about performing. On the other hand, 'anxious' is defined as 'uneasy or apprehensive, usually in advance of a potential or real threat' - thus suggesting that if someone has such a level of anxiety, it's unlikely they'd perform in the first place. \n9.

The possible choices may make sense to a degree, but we also need to account for those that might not make any sense given the context.\n\n### Eliminating Irrelevant Choices\n\nFor this question, we can eliminate the answer choice that implies the person is doing something creative (c: being recognized by the Media) and another that implies there are no other achievements to be proud of (Answer E: doing something creative). \n\nAnswer choice (C) implies the person is being recognized by the media, which is different than having a great deal of personal pride in what they do.\nAnswer option (E) implies that the person is creative in some way.

The only information to help us is that the clock is located on the plaza. Which word refers to the clock? Choices:  a. wall b. plaza c. building d. square e. tower\nRationales:  1. The given information describes a flat plaza with a large clock, and the question is asking which word refers to the clock.\n2. Considering the clock is found on the plaza, the most logical place for it to be, in order to function, would be at the centre of the plaza.\n3. Building, tower, square and wall are all structures which can be found on a plaza.\n4. Looking at building, tower and square, we can eliminate square because it refers to the space inside which something is contained or located. A clock is a large object by nature, but it is still a separate object from the plaza.\n5. Looking further at building, tower and wall, we can eliminate building (as we have already excluded square) and tower (because it is not a structure on top of a building but a separate structure \u2013 we do not actually \"build\" towers, for example; it is a separate structure that is built on buildings).\n6. Therefore, building and tower can be eliminated as possible answers.\n7. Wall and clock do not make much sense because a wall encompasses a space and a clock is an individual object. \n8. Wall is no longer an option.\n9. Therefore the best answer choice is C, \"clock\". \n\nInput", "answer": " 186"}

It does not tell us whether someone who is happy can still suffer from reservations around performing. \n6.

Choices:  A. nothing B. how I feel C. I love working D. I don't hate my mother E. I enjoy working and I don't mind my mother\nRationales:\n1. For the sentence to have a meaning it must be complete, it is only a fragment. It is most likely about personal feelings or experience, and as the fragment states I enjoy working but don't like to be with my mother there is probably a link but it is missing.\n2. For the sentence to complete we need to know more. The choice that would complete the fragment would be that I don't mind because I enjoy working. This is not an untypical thing to say for someone who enjoys working and maybe doesn't get paid enough to really complain about every aspect of the job. It seems odd to be upset about something when the positives greatly outweigh the negatives. \n3. Because the fragment only has the first part that deals with the job we know that the remaining part will deal with the person being asked about. Which brings us to the word \"but\" because the fragment has a conjunction that is typically used (in English) when referring to contrasting ideas within the sentence \n4. Therefore, we know that the rest of the sentence will discuss something they hate or don't like as the previous choice could have a similar meaning.\n5. As the fragment is incomplete, I would say there is nothing we can learn from that statement besides that I enjoy working", "answer": " 32"}

Choices:  I: used II: new III: worn out IV: expensive  A: I, II B: II, IV C: I, III D: IV, III E: I, II, III, IV\nRationales: The meaning of the question is indicated by its use of the word 'condition'. \n1. 'Condition' is a standard term for when something is still in a certain state - like a used car being in its \u2018original condition\u2019. \n2. So, looking at the choices, we see there isn\u2019t an option that doesn\u2019t include the word \u2018condition\u2019.\n3. However, we can eliminate two choices from consideration. \n4. The last answer, E, includes all the options. Thus, it\u2019s too broad and doesn\u2019t make sense as we can assume something in good (I, II) or bad (III, IV) condition.\n5. So, by eliminating choice E from consideration and limiting our options to I, II and III, we see that the choice that makes the most sense to us is choice B, II, IV.\n6. The choice II, IV, as suggested by choice B, is the most likely one for the person who asked the question.\n7.

This rationale leads us to eliminate Choices B and D.

If an individual gets a bacterial infections, they could be mentally impacted, physically impacted or both. \nBacterial infections can lead to depression and fatigue, which are mental symptoms. They can also make it harder to complete tasks requiring physical effort, such as chores and sport activities. \nIn severe cases, bacterial infeations can cause sepsis, an extreme response by the body caused by an infection.

{"text": "fly', is invalid because the phrase doesn't make sense. It's likely meant to say, 'butterflies' instead of 'butterfly' as there is no singular butterfly. \n5.

Choices A and B are thus invalid and can be removed from consideration. \n7.

Choice D, excitement, is incorrect as it's also positive in nature, not the opposite emotional response the question is implying. \n9. Choices B and C are thus invalidated based on the negative connotation of the question, and Choice D, excitement cannot be the correct answer because it also lacks a logical fit.\n10.

It is obvious that this is the career choice of an individual who repairs cars and diagnoses issues with them, which are options A and B. \nChoice C describes someone who specializes in repairing four-wheel drive vehicles. However, this would not be a qualifier to the term \"car mechanic\". \nChoice D does not fully define what a car mechanic is, as while they may be able to tell if there's an issue with your car, they may also be needed to fix issues with it. \nChoice E is irrelevant because it implies this person is more than just a car mechanic, it is also clear that choosing D makes more sense.\n\nAnswer: A: tinkers with your car and B: fixes your car\n\nInput: The number of words you need to say in order to say more than a word?

{"text": "fly', is also incorrect because to suffer is a state that people are in, not something they do; butterflies are also an irrelevant topic, as butterflies are not a person or a talent category.\n5. Choices C and D can eliminate the other choices, but they too are incorrect. Choice C, the 'anxiety', implies that anxiety is not something a person can suffer from, rather it is a common side effect of suffering. Choice D, the 'happiness', doesn't make sense because if a person is happy about their talent, why would they avoid performing?\n6. Thus, the answer left is either E or A. Let's review E: 'enjoyable' as it makes sense to someone who is talented but doesn't enjoy performing, the performer would be reluctant to do so, hence a happy and enthusiastic performer may not fit the bill.\n7. Consider A: 'injury', this is correct because a talent person can suffer from injury, if they perform. The key phrase is 'talent but', so a talent person can suffer injury, and anxiety or sadness or happiness if they choose to or are required to perform.\n8. Therefore the answer is A: injury.\nAnswer: A. Injury\n\nInput: At the concert, I had the opportunity to sit next someone in the audience. Who was it? Choices: \tA: nobody B: me C: some person D: someone else E: unknown\nRationales:1. The question is \"I had the opportunity to sit near a person\" this means that you sat near someone who you did not know. Thus, the one you sat near was someone you don't know.2. Choices A, B, C, D all have the words \"me\" or \"my\" which means that whoever it was you meant these words.\n3. If you had the chance to sit next to someone, you didn't sit as close to them as you could, thus \"some person\" is incorrect.\n4. \"Some person implies that \"someone\" could not have been the person who sat next to you.\n5. \"Unknown\" refers to a person whose identity is undisclosed, thus this is incorrect, but it may refer to someone who was unspecified, but this is incorrect as well.\n6.", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't fit because 'injury and butterfly' are not validly connected. Additionally, there is the issue that 'talent persons' don't exist, rendering this choice moot. \n5. Similarly, Choice C, 'anxiety', doesn't make sense in relation to 'injury and anxiety' \n6. Choice D, happiness, while a mental reservation, doesn't make sense unless used as a direct synonym for performance, because 'happiness' is not the reason someone wouldn't want to perform. \n7. Choice E, energetic, doesn't make much sense either unless used as a synonym for performance as 'energetic' doesn't imply a lack of willingness to do something. \n8. Therefore, we are left with Choices C, B, and D, each of which makes sense if used to refer to fear or anxiety and thus implies that the person has a mental reservation not a physical one. \n9. In conclusion, Choice E makes more sense than the other three because it is an exact synonym for 'performance', whereas the others either lack obvious relevance, or are vague synonyms. \n10.

E: School is a public place where the first experience tends to take place.\nRationales: The answer to the clue question is not just about what the first experience would be but that experiences should come early in life. \nLet's now consider each of the choices. 1. A is incorrect because it suggests that there are people who do not live in other countries. But there would be plenty of children from foreign countries who would have had experiences before starting school. 2. B suggests that some people wouldn't be able to start their school day early enough to go home and then return. This is an absurd claim because at the end of the school day, children would be dropped off to work at their home. 3. C is incorrect because it suggests people start working too early to go to school. But everyone will have had experience at schools before they started working. 4.

The list of options includes to do nothing, to help the healthy people, to talk, and to watch movies. \n3. Option D, \"watch movie\", would not fit because a doctor is likely at work or engages with patients. It wouldn't make sense if a doctor is still spending their time at their workplace watching movies. \n4. Option D could mean that a doctor may occasionally go outside his or her workplace to see a movie. However, it does not mean that the doctor regularly spends most of his or her time outside healthcare profession. \n5. Option E, \"go home\", does not make sense because a doctor is likely still at work when not doing patient care. \n6. Option A, \"do nothing\", does not make a lot of sense either. As a doctor who is not working as medical care professional, there is not much to do. \n7. Option B, \"help the healthy people\", is not a proper answer as it suggests that a doctor is not doing his or her job at the health clinic.

In other words, it asks about a dislike of performing, rather than a positive or negative emotion toward performing. \n7. Choice B, \"talent persons cannot suffer\", is relevant as it indicates potential reluctance to perform, but does not describe a dislike of performing. \n8.

Choices:  B: shyness C: disinterest D: anger E: fear\nRationales: The question asks \"what could account for her behavior?\"\n\nWhen one is trying to identify a cause of a behavior, it is important to understand that this behavior can mean different things to different people. \n\nFor instance, if someone were to say, \"She didn't speak to me,\" you could not assume this meant the person was scared, shy or angry without further context.\n\nTherefore, it is important to narrow down potential causes of behavior by first asking yourself, \"What behavior are they referring to?\" or \"What could have caused this behavior?\"\n\nIn our example, she didn't speak to \"us,\" but we do not know whether \"us\" refers to a group, family, business or individual friends, we cannot assume that her behavior refers to the same thing.\n\nIf you don't know what someone means, ask them or look for a context clue.\n\nThen, you can consider a plausible cause of your behavior that best fits what you assume is being discussed. \n\nIf you ask yourself, \"What behavior could I be referring to?\" but you don't know, consider looking for a context clue to better understand what you're saying.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "flys', isn't an answer, as the answer contains the incorrect word 'butterflys'.\n5. Choice D, happiness, is incorrect because it describes an emotion, rather than a disorder.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety' and E, 'energetic' are terms that describe emotional states and would not describe a condition someone may suffer from.\n7. This leaves us with only Choice B, 'anxiety', which is the best answer.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: What type of plant grows from the ground up? Choices:  C: climbing plant D: flower E: vegetable F: weed G: creeper\nRationales:1. The question is about what type of plant grows from its roots to its stem and leaves. \n2. Choice D, a flower, is incorrect because a flower is a type of plant that typically grows above the ground level, not below. \n3. Looking at choices A, B, and G, we can eliminate them because they either have multiple meanings and are overly broad (A, B) or are too narrow to describe all the categories (G). \n4. Choices C, F and E do not describe a plant that grows from its roots to the surface of the ground. \n5. Choices D and F do not describe a plant in the family Monocots, an early evolutionary branch of plants that grow vertically.\n6. Based on the given choices, the best answer is Choice B: creeper.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: Do you think the man was telling the truth or lying through his teeth? Choices:  B: lying through his teeth C: telling the truth D: telling it like it is  E: telling tales F: telling stories G: falsehood stories H: yarn-spinning\nRationales:\n1. The question is wondering what type of information is being given. Whether it is true or false, accurate or inaccurate, factual or fictitious, etc...\n2. Choices C, D, and G are ways to talk about whether something is in fact true or not.\n3. Choices H and B are not relevant or specific enough, being vague and overly broad.\n4. Choices E and F are ways of talking about \"fiction story\"", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "flys', is a ridiculous answer since butterflies are insects, and 'talented person' isn't a type of insect. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit as the question is not asking about a cause-and-effect relationship, but rather a relation to some unstated context. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, would be the most fitting of all the choices, based on the description of the hypothetical person. \n7. Therefore, option C, 'anxiety', is the most feasible option.\nAnswer: AI: anxiety\n\nInput: What do all the birds in nature have in common? Choices:  I: wings II: eyes III: beaks IV: feet V: birds\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about all the characteristics shared by birds in the natural world. \n2. The most direct answer is V: birds, which makes the most sense since it's the only thing that is listed multiple times in the question. \n3. Some other things shared by all birds that are not listed explicitly are that they are usually warm-blooded, have a backbone, and lay eggs. But these are not characteristics unique to birds, so they don't qualify for this question. \n4. Therefore, option V: birds is the correct answer.\nAnswer: Answer: V: birds\n\nInput: In what year did the great war end? Choices: 2000, 2102, 2014, 2020, 2099\nRationales:1. The question asks when, approximately, the famous war known as \"the great war\" ended.\n2. Looking at these options, each of them presents a war or conflict with a different start time in the 20th century.\n3. Only \"2099\" presents a war that would come close to the same time period as the great war.\n4. Therefore, the answer option is B: 2099.\nAnswer: D; 2099 \n\nInput: I had to find where a person lived in order to meet their roommate for the first time, which choice above would be a reasonable place to find their address? Choice: Cities, States, Locations, Home cities, or Ne", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "'s', doesn't make sense as it implies that we have some type of allergic reaction that prevents us from performing.\n5. Choices D and E both suggest that a person who hates performing likely suffer from joy or happiness.\n6. Choices A and B may not be good choices as they involve negative feelings.\n7. Looking at choices C and F, they both suggest possible results of being unable to publicly show a talent. They don't define what the condition is or how to address the condition except to say that if the person hates performing, it can be a struggle for them.\n8. This opens up the best choice as being Choice C, 'anxiety', as it describes a person who has difficulty publicly performing, specifically due to anxiety. \n9. Thus, the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: ______ of the great outdoors can be a bit overwhelming the first time you visit. \n  Choices: A: forests B: mountains C: deserts D: coasts E: wilderness\nRationales: The question asks about what part of the outdoors could be overwhelming, and the answer is given as an adjective that must agree with the noun 'outdoors'. \nThere are multiple parts of the great outdoords, but the options available exclude the choice 'great outdoors'.\n  Choice A would therefore be the correct answer as it is an adjective that matches 'of the great outdoors'.\nAnswer: A", "answer": " 250"}
{"text": "fly' is similarly irrelevant. It is unclear what this sentence means, or what relationship it has to either talent or injury. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also a poor answer as while it might be true that happy people don't usually suffer from anxiety, it doesn't mean they're necessarily anxious. It must be a person's aversions.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energy', are good. They have a relationship to performing arts. \n7. Considering that anxiety and energy is negative, the correct choice is D, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: A: anxiety\n\nInput: A computer virus is what? Choices: A: a computer's software B: human beings C: a malicious program installed by someone D: a harmful malware E: an unfortunate experience\nRationales: Looking at choices, A, B, C, D, and E, you can eliminate all the wrong ones: human beings (B) are not considered a type of virus at all and cannot be computer viruses, and 'install' and'someone' (D) would indicate that the virus was installed on the machine with intent, which is not what a virus does.\nSo you can say with confidence that these are wrong answers.\nNow, to determine an answer, you have to be very specific and ask what the virus is. It must be a computer virus, not a human virus or a software virus, for example. \nNow, looking at your choices, choose one that answers the specificity question, for example,'malicious' (C). All computer viruses are malicious and not every computer virus is malicious. However, only one of your answers is malicious, which is computer-related, so therefore, C is the right answer.\nAnswer: A - computer-related - virus\n\nInput: Some people consider _______ an important part of life. Choices:  A. bikes B. art C. cars D. books E. education\nRationales: This question is to find out the people's opinion toward something that is considered an important part of life, let's firstly consider A - bikes. \n1. Bikes are used to transport a person or things, which is a necessary activity that cannot be forgotten, so it is a good one.\n2", "answer": " 2020"}
{"text": "fly', is a generalization that suggests talent people can only suffer from having butterflies as they perform. This is untrue and, thus, incorrect.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness' are irrelevant as they would not necessarily occur to a person with a reservation or a talent like performing. \n6. Considering that people have a hard time performing a talent in front of an audience when nervous, Choice E, 'energetic', is the correct choice because it can help relieve performance anxiety.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: energetic.\nAnswer: E; energetic\n\nInput: The scientist was eager to see the results of her experiment, the scientist must complete what? Choices: A: a theory B: analysis C: data collection D: data analysis E: data collection and data analysis\nRationales: As the question suggests, the scientist wanted to see the result of her experiment, implying that she was looking for an answer.\n\n1. Choices A, B, and C are irrelevant as they are not the things that give the scientist the answer she seeks.\n2. Therefore, to gain data, a scientist must collect data and analyze the data.\n3. Therefore, the answer can be D or E, where D means collect and analyze data.\n\nAnswer: C: D and E", "answer": " 42"}
{"text": "fly', isn't true as the implication of the sentence in context is that the person has a talent for performing, and 'talent persons' would seem too general. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is a different type of emotion from anxiety. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, makes sense given the context. \n7. Choice E, energetic, doesn't necessarily mean having enough mental or emotional energy to perform on stage, so it's not likely to be the right answer. \n8. Therefore, this leaves us with Choice C, anxieties, being the only possibility that could fit the question, providing the answer is Choice C, anxility.\nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot perform\n\nInput: What type of insects like to make homes in your hair? Choices:  Wasp A: Honey B: Tick C: Bee D: Ants E: All bugs\nRationales: The wasp, bee, ant, black widow, and all other types of insects might build nests in the hair, but this requires understanding what types of insects like to build nests on humans. \n\nThe correct answer is B: Tick.\n\nInput: The cat jumped on a table and landed on his feet? Choices: 1. I can't believe that cat didn't break any bones 2. He is in agony 3. What are you talking about 4. It is not possible 5. He is so talented\n\nRationales:\n\nI can't believe that (you know about an event)\n\nWhat are you talking about\n\nHe is in agony\n\n* It is not possible\n\nThe correct answer would be \u201cIt is not possible\u201d.\n\nInput: A lot of people are afraid of ____ which is why they do not like riding roller coasters. Choices: 1) snakes 2) public speaking 3) water 4: heights\nRationales: A lot of the audience are afraid of snakes, but we do not know whether they dislike roller coasters or not.\n\nThe answer is: B) public speaking\n\nInput: There were more than 100 people in the class when the teacher announced that she would close the front door", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense because the options are not mutually exclusive. We can also eliminate choice C, 'anxiety', because anxiety is an emotion, not a disability. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also not a plausible answer as happiness is a feeling and a state of being in general. Additionally, a person being happy about performing would not necessarily mean that they are not suffering from anxiety about doing so, which is the true implication of the question.\n6. Therefore, the best answers are 'D' and 'E'. 'D' because they are the only options that mean the person is unwilling to perform because of some pre-existing mental disorder. 'E' because it describes the mental state a person would have if they were unable to do performances.\nAnswer: D,E.\n\nInput: An old tree is like a piece of what? Choices A: nature B: art C: building D: history E: wood\nRationales: The question is asking what an old tree can be compared to.\n1. Some things we know from the questions are that the tree is old, so we should not pick a thing that is young.\n2. We know that a tree is made of wood, and one thing that wood is used for is building.\n3. That means we are looking for something old.\n4. Choices A, B, C, and D are all things that are both old and made of wood.\n5. That means Choice E must be the right answer: history.\n\nInput: In the town of Vancouver, the tourists go, what is it called? Choices: 1. A: Vancouver tourist 2. B: BC visitors C: Washington visitor D: Alaska visitor 2. E: Alberta visitors\nRationales:The question is asking about the name for tourists visiting Vancouver.\n1. The first reason to eliminate answers is to avoid choices that contradict the question.\n2. Choice A, Vancouver tourists, clearly does not answer the question since its name is the whole city, not just the visitors.\n3. Choices C, Washington visitors, and D, Alaska visitors were not given enough context to answer this question. If there are other towns then Washington's tourists are going to be the wrong choices.\n4. Chooses B,", "answer": " 1200"}
{"text": "flie', is a grammatical error, and doesn't mention what they suffer from. \n5. Choice D, anxiety, is a mental ailment that is related, but there are other mental issues that may hinder one from performing too.\n6. Choices A, B, and C are all incorrect. \n7. Therefore, we are left with choices E: 'energetic', or 'happiness'. \n8. Though the two may seem similar, happiness and energy are not one and the same thing. \n9. Thus, the correct answer choice is E: energetic. \nAnswer:  E: energetic \n\nInput: Which answer does not make ___? Choices: 1. A:  sense 2. B:  good 3. C:  the most logical. 4. D:  bad 5. E:  true\nRationales:\n1. Start by looking at choice A: answer ___ does not make \"sense\".\n2. Sense can be defined as a feeling of understanding or reason derived from facts or experiences.\n3. Eliminate option A, because sense does not make sense.\n4. Consider the other choices: \n5. Now we can eliminate most of the choices (except for choice E: true): \n6. Only Choice D can be true (answer that doesn't make sense).\n7. Therefore, by elimination, choice D is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E :true", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because it is describing a type of feeling and not making a conclusion about suffering.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', are emotional terms and may indicate a willingness of performing. \n6. Choice B, on the other hand, indicates a lack of willingness to perform. \n7. Choice E, however, is an adjective, so it isn't really making a statement about personality or disposition. \n8. Choice D, is thus the best answer option.\nAnswer: D D: talent persons cannot suffer happiness.\n\nInput: I made a mistake while applying for a job, I feel terrible. I would like to say I am really sorry to all the individuals I had to work with, what should I say to that person? Choices:  C: it wasn't my fault D: it will never happen again E: that I would love the opportunity to make it right\nRationales: The question wants to know how to make up for a mistake if you made a mistake while applying to a job.\n1. The mistake could have happened in a conversation with a candidate or in a cover letter. \n2. If it happened in a conversation with another individual, then you could say that the mistake was not your fault and apologise for it happening. \n3. If it happened in your cover letter, then you could say it will never happen again and offer to make it right by taking another look at the cover letter and doing it over.\n4. To make the most sense with regards to the cover letter, I think the best response would be E. \n\nAnswer: C: it wasn'ts my fault. \n\n<input id=\"prompt17\">\n\nInput: To get from the United States to England, you can take a flight which lasts how long? Choices: 1000 years D: 30 hours E: 7 days F: 5 months G: 2 weeks\nRationales: <br>\nThe question asks how long it typically takes to travel from the United States to London?\n\n1. The easiest way to answer this question is to eliminate options that are not based in reality.\n\n2. Choices E and F are not realistic, which are the longest and third-longest amounts of time respectively.", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "flies.', doesn't relate to our answer as it refers to talent persons instead and has nothing to do with if they suffer from anxiety. \n5. Choice D, is not a medical condition that someone can 'catch'. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, seems plausible. As the question implies, they have a talent that they like performing, despite not wanting to. \n7. As this answer could make sense, we must determine if it has the right structure to make it the answer.\n8. \"Talent but doesn't like to show\" does not align. This phrase, therefore, would not make sense in the sentence structure. \n9. Choices D and E do not make sense as they refer to how happy, not talent, a person can be. \n10. Thus, by ruling out the incorrect options, we have narrowed our choices to just 'anxiety', which is a reasonable response.\nAnswer: D A: anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following is NOT considered an attribute of high-quality writing? Choices: 1. A: proper spelling B: appropriate grammar C: attention-grabbing content D: thoughtful construction E: clarity\nRationales: First Step: Include \"NOT\" to eliminate incorrect answers\n1. The question is looking to determine what is included in high-quality writing.\n2. Looking at our choices, a clear and concise statement tells us that, \"C: attention-grabbincontent D: thoughtful construction\" is incorrect.\n3. A quality essay doesn't necessarily include content, and the essay's construction cannot be considered content.\n4. Additionally, the question is looking for answers that are indicative elements of good writing, which this essay does not display.\n5. \"C\" then also eliminates \"D\" as it also says that a high-quality essay needs \"thoughtful construction.\"\n6. The next thing to do is to eliminate an answer based on a false premise.\n7. Since \"A\" includes high-quality writing needs proper spelling, then an incorrect question would ask, \"Which of the following IS considered an attribute of high quality writing?\". However, since the question asks what is NOT considered an attribute, then \"A,\" which includes proper spelling, would not be correct. \n8", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "lies'. is an unrelated conceptualization that doesn't affect people's ability to perform. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit, as while people that are happy are more likely to perform, it does not necessarily mean that people who do not enjoy performing must be unhappy. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is a psychological and not physical, so it does not affect one's ability to perform, and thus doesn't make sense. \n7. Choice E, energy, lacks sufficient detail to understand what context of energy is being referred to. \n8. Thus, there is an answer that makes the most sense, which is choice B. \nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: You had a long week during which you had to do all of your work in time for the end of the day, what should you do when you're done? Choices:  H: relax A: put in more energy B: go for a walk while thinking about what you did and how you did it C: listen to some new music\nRationales: In this exercise, it has been a long and busy day at work. This situation makes the options we choose seem fitting.\nI. As we would like to relax, then A is the answer.\nII. As we want to spend time thinking on our work, then B is the answer.\nIII. As we want to clear our mind, then C is the answer.\nIV. As we want to improve the experience, then there is no need to mention that, so we can select the answer E.\nAnswer: A\n\n### Instructions:Read the paragraph and answer the questions.\n\n### Paragraph:\nToday\u2019s business world puts a great demand on every employee to work harder, smarter and more efficiently.

{"text": "fly'isn't a grammatically correct sentence. \n5. Choice D, though plausible, is not what the question refers to - happiness. \n6. Choice C, while it does not necessarily have to do with performing, is still not relevant, as it is still an emotion.\n7. So, the answer must refer to something psychological related to performing.\n8. Considering the sentence, \"they probably suffer from...\" we can infer that they dislike performing due to some issue, rather than no issue at all.\n9. Hence, the correct answer must refer to something that causes anxiety during a performance.\n10. A quick search for examples of what anxiety people suffer from when performing could lead you to examples such as imposter syndrome, stage fright, or social anxiety, which could all contribute to someone not enjoying performing.\n11. Therefore, we can confidently choose Option D, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\n### Instructions: In each of the following sentences, choose the option that correctly completes the sentence.\n\nThe lab results had been calculated, therefore, the scientist prepared the data to analyze. Why was this analysis undertaken?\n\nAnswer: E: in order to better understand the data\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: What is the meaning of the expression \"The lab had been calculated, therefore the scientist prepared to analysis the data.\"\nRationales:\n1. The phrase, 'The lab had been calculated' means that the lab results had been compiled and analyzed, as if it were a math problem. The question asks what was the scientist doing.\n2. So, the answer should be what the scientist had been doing. Options A and B aren't correct because they don't give much information, and the sentence makes sense in their context even if they weren't there.\n3. Choices C, D, and E are all plausible as answers here.\n4. However, D and E use 'the data' as the object of 'analyze' not 'analyze' itself. So, the answer is C.\nAnswer: C\n\n### Instractions: In each of these passaging, choose the option that completes each sentence to best reflect the ideas presented.\n\nWhy should scientist have faith in science because", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "fly', also doesn't fit as butterflies is not the same as anxiety, and injury is more anatomy-related than psychology-related. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\", seems to refer to the outcome of performing versus the cause for someone to perform in the first place, which is not what we are focused on.\n6. Choices B, D and E all refer to psychological states, suggesting that A, B, D, and E are all in our possibilities. \n7. Among the four psychological phenomena left out, anxiety most likely describes an individual's reluctance to perform. So, we can eliminate choice B.\n8. Therefore we are left with three options: anxiety, sadness, and enjoyment.\n9. Looking through them, anxiety seems the most appropriate answer to our given criteria as it most directly refers to a negative emotional experience that may have a psychological explanation.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question is anxiety, as the person in this situation suffers from anxiety, not a performer's equivalent.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety\n\nInput: To avoid an unwanted pregnancy, one should use what? Choices: A: condoms B: diaphragms C: a shot D: pills E: nothing\nRationales:1. The question aims to emphasize the benefits of using a particular contraceptive method, so the correct answer should emphasize the positive effects of using contraceptives\n2. There are so many answers in the list - what is the best? \n3. Looking through, A. Condom is the best choice to avoid unwanted pregnancy.\n4. As is mentioned in the question, contraceptives are used by young people to avoid pregnancy. To avoid unwanted pregnancies, condoms are the most effective methods.\n5. Therefore, answer A: condom is the best answer. \nAnswer: A. Condom\n\nInput: The sun is a star of planet earth, what is the sun in its most correct form? Choices: A. planet B. star C. planet D. sun E. black hole\nRationales: Question asks for what is called in its most common term (the sun) but also in its most correct scientific term (star). \n1. Cho", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense. \n5. Similarly, choice C, 'anxiety', is a feeling or emotion, not a medical concept nor a reason people don't perform on stage. \n6. Choice D, happiness, is again emotional, but we've already excluded that possibility. \n7. Lastly, Choice E, 'energetic', doesn't make logical sense as an energetic person would likely appear to have excess energy, and not struggle to showcase that energy. \n8. So, based on what we know, we can eliminate all options but Choice B, and based on what we know of talent persons, and what this person in particular 'doesn't like performing', \n9. we can deduce that they are likely the anxiety Choice B.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: My brother and I got into trouble with the principal for? Choices:1. writing graffiti on the school walls 2. writing homework on the walls 3. drawing stupid doodles on the walls 4. breaking the chalkboard 5. writing our names all over the walls\nRational: 1. The choices given imply that the students were writing something illegal on the walls, however 2. was the opposite of what they were suppose to be doing. \n2. 2. Were given the option to write graffiti or homework. \n3. 3. The 3. choice was given to express that the students were trying to be silly or were making stupid doodles. \n4. 4. The choice 4. was given to indicate that the students were trying their hardest to break the chalkboard. \n5. 5.

{"text": "flys,' doesn't relate specifically to 'performing,' but more to 'performing talent'. \n5. Choice E, \"energy,\" doesn't make sense as it does not relate to performing, just general activity in general. \n6. Choice D, \"anxiety,\" makes sense as performing can sometimes cause anxiety in people. \n7. However, this still does not mean that \"anxiety\" is the only answer.\n8. Hence, we can further narrow down our answer set by eliminating some of the choices that have already been ruled out through logic. \n9. We can eliminate choice B for not being correct, choice D as an option as anxiety is not necessarily a reservation towards performing, and choice E as it is a general term, not tied to this question's context.\n10. This narrows down the answer set to choices C and D. 11. Choice C, \"Anxiety,\" does not make sense as the statement that \"talent persons cannot suffer injury and butterflelds,\" does not make complete sense. \n12. The statement implies that performing is accompanied by injuries and nervousness. \n13. Hence, choice \"C\" doesn't make sense because \"injury,\" does not fit the \"injuries\" and \"butterflies\" phrase. \n14. Choice D, therefore, is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D. A.\n\nInput: How do you know that one team is better than another? Choices: 1. A: better records and statistics B: bigger stadiums and crowds C: lower point totals D: more wins E: both team are equally good\nRationales: The question is asking how to tell that one team is better or superior than another. \nLooking at the options provided: Choice A: teams with better records and statistics, could be potentially associated with superiority, as better records often indicates a team's potential to win a game.\nChoice B: bigger stadiums, crowds is not an attribute or characteristic of a team, or a measure of success, and not explicitly associated with success or excellence. \nChoice C: fewer point totals could be associated with team inferiority. A team scoring fewer points could suggest it's weaker than a team scoring more points. \nChoice", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "lies', doesn't make sense because the person is suffering from something, it doesn't make sense that all talent persons can't suffer from something \u2013 they can. \n5. Choices D and E don't make sense as they are not symptomatic of talent persons. \n6. Looking at the options remaining, Choice C, 'anxiety', describes the kind of psychological disturbance the person experiences in relation to performing, i.e. butterflies in stomach or nervousness. \n7. Therefore, we can identify that the most logical choice is C, 'anxiet'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: I'd like to order a chicken Caesar salad, will that be enough? Choices: 1. A chicken Caesar sal: 2.  Chip, fish and 3. Half a salad, 4. The whole salad\nRationales: The question is asking if a chicken caesar salad is enough for you to order.\n\n1. All those choices except 4 don't make sense because you'd just be getting less of the salad you want.\n2. As well, a chicken Caesar is generally enough, but if you want some fish or chips, those things don't go with a Caesar. \n3. Likewise, you wouldn't want both the chicken and fish unless you were getting a half and half. \n4. Therefore, this is clearly enough.\n\nInput: The man's father has three sons, how many sons does he have? Choices: 0, 2, 1, 3, 4\nRationales: Look at each of the given choices and think about how appropriate they are.\n\n0 sons are not possible as that's less than zero, so we eliminate that option.\n\n1 son makes sense, but wouldn't necessarily be what was asked so we eliminate that.\n\n3 sons is more likely than other options so that should be your final choice.\n\n4 sons is the one given. So that should be your final answer.\n\nAnswer: 4 sons.", "answer": " 2000"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense either, as a talent refers to one's ability, not potential physical harm. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is irrelevant as the question is implying that this person suffers from something, and happiness is an emotional state without a cause.\n6. Choices B and D can be ruled out, narrowing down the possible answers to either C, 'Anxiety', or E, 'energetic'\n7. 'Anxiety', refers to a mental state of tension and worry, which sounds more appropriate than 'energetic' in this context. \n8. Hence, the answer is C: anxiety. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: All of the questions asked here were answered correctly, there are none which remain unanswered. What kind of questions can you ask if you wish to answer all of them correctly?

{"text": "lfies', doesn't make sense, as injury cannot happen to a talent and the answer is looking for a psychological phenomena, not physical. \n5. Choice D, (which is actually 'happiness') sounds correct, but there are actually a lot of talented people who enjoy performing; a talent and a love of performing are neither synonymous nor mutually exclusive. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is the only choice that makes sense, considering that it deals with psychological reservations and feelings. \n7. Therefore, option C: anxiety is the best answer to this question.\nAnswer: C anxiety\n\nInput: What will happen if in one day you find out you passed the test and you are not on the list of people to move forward? Choices:  a: you are not on the correct list b: you will need to go through a different screeners c: you will need to retake the test d: you will need to apply for a completely different job e: they will rescreen you\nRationales: There are several options which could be the correct answer, but there are several hints in the wording which can help to determine which one is correctly phrased and which ones aren't. These clues are:  \"this test\" refers to the test the person has already taken, which means the correct answer is related to the situation that occurs after the test they've already taken, so they are not going to rretake another test.\nThis is followed by the wording, \"you are not on the list to move forward.\"\nFor someone to be eliminated from consideration and no longer move to the next step in the application process, they must have already passed the test, as it would be impossible for someone to fail, then be eliminated.\nTo reiterate, they must have already been placed somewhere, and now for some reason are not going to be able to be in that group or position.\nTo complete the question, \"you are not one the list to move forward,\" this leads to the conclusion that they will need to go through the screening process again.\nAnswer: B: you will need to rescreen.\n\nInput: If the wind is blowing and a cocoon is on the ground and a bee lands on top of the cocoon, will the bee stick to the cocoon?

{"text": "fly', lacks a coherent structure and is essentially saying that no talent may be injured.\n5. Choices C to E appear to be worded similarly; they essentially mean nervousness and anxiety. \n6. Choice D, \"anxiety\", fits as it can mean nervousness and apprehension and can refer to any sort of feeling.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety.\n\nInput: Who is authorized to start a business? Choices: 0.A: an individual B: only governments are authorizes to start businesses C: a group of friends D: an institution E: the government\nRationales:1. The question is regarding who is authorized to start up a new business. \n2. Choices A & C, 'an individual' and 'a group of friends' are examples of entities that can start a business, but are not authorized to start a company. \n3. Only governments are typically authorized to start new companies, as they have access to funding and the potential to hire staff.\n4. Therefore answer B.\nAnswer: B. government\n\nInput: What happens if a bacterium is not destroyed by antibiotics? Choices: 1.A: it is resistant to future antibiotics 2.B:the antibiotics are too powerful 3.C:none of these are correct 4.D: the antibiotics are overused 5.E:  bacteria multiplies quickly in a sick person\nRationales:2. Choices A, B, D, and E all have positive connotations, whereas Choice C is a negative remark that doesn't align with the wording in the question.\n3. Choices A and D both use the terms \"resistant to\" while Choice B uses \"too powerful.\" All three of these words refer to the idea that the bacteria are stronger than the antibiotic.\n4. The term \"overuse\" is used in Choice B, suggesting that a bacterium is only resistant to antibiotics when overused. In contrast, the terminology \"multiplies quickly\" used in Choice E is used when describing an overrunning of bacteria without overuse.\n5. Therefore", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "flys', contains a verb tense error ('persons' does not agree with 'cannot'). This does not seem reasonable, and it is not the case that talent people cannot suffer from injury.\n5. Choices C and D both relate to performance anxiety, which is a normal part of performance art. Anxiety or 'butterflies' can be expected and is not a reason to stop performing. \n6. Therefore, the answer should be E, which means 'energetic.' \nAnswer: E: energetic.\n\nInput: What two things does a cake need? Choices: . The two ingredients are:. A: sugar and flour. B: sugar and eggs. C: milk and eggs. D: eggs and milk. E: all of the ingredients\nRationales:.1. The question is \"What two things does a cakes need?\" which means that, since a cake is an edible dessert made from either a mixture of fresh ingredients, prepared ingredients, or both, we should select answer options that describe one of those possible ingredients.\n.2. Option E does not make sense because a cake does not need all of the ingredient. The answer to the question should be \"A: sugar and flour, B: sugar and eggs, or C: milk and eggs.\".\n\nInput: Before I could get my pet to say a few words, I asked what the dog said.

{"text": "fly', is correct as the word 'person' can include both male and female gender-neutral options and would exclude gender-specific terminology such as'man' or 'boy' which may appear in this phrase.\n5. Choices C and E do not refer to performance discomfort in a way that would pertain to this situation.\n6. Looking at the remaining options - option D, 'Anxiety', and option E, 'Happiness', are both emotions that could potentially cause difficulties in performing, but they don't relate specifically to performing the way options C and E do.\n7. Therefore the closest answer is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D : anxiety\n\nInput: If you were having fun with some people over Thanksgiving, what would you call those people? Choices: \nA: Aunt and uncle\nB: Family member\nC: Uncles and aunts\nD: Relatives\nE: Other\nRationales:\n1. The question is about what you would call the people who you had fun with over Thanksgiving.\n2. Looking over the 5 options for the question, if you were having fun over Thanksgiving with your Aunt you would call her Aunt and Uncle. \n3. Option B, Family Member, does not make sense because a relative such as an Uncle is a family member and will not need to be called anything else.\n4. Option C, Uncles and Aunts, does not make sense as an Uncle or Aunt is neither.\n5. Option D, Relatives, does not work well for Aunt and Uncle, as Uncle is a relative. \n6. Option E, Other, is the best choice because it does not have any information associated with it.\n7. Option E is the correct answer.", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense. There are too many issues with this. 'Talent persons' sounds like a made up word and 'Butterflies' is just not relevant.\n5. Choices C and E are specific psychological conditions like 'anxiety' and 'energy' that could make it difficult or reluctant to perform. Thus these are also not appropriate choices. \n6. Choice D, happiness, could potentially be a cause of inaction, but it's also broad so as such is not a very specific answer. \n7. Therefore, using a logical thought process, the best answer is Choice D: happiness.\nAnswer: D. happiness\n\nInput: The word \"impenetrable\" is an antonym of \"what?\" Choices:  A. porous B. penchant for C. penchant D. penchant E. porous\nRationales: The word \u201cimpenetrable\" could be an antonym of many words however it could only be an antonym to one word. \nTherefore, the word it is not a porous which means permeable by air and water.

{"text": "flys', is an incorrect interpretation of the question, implying that injury and butterflying are not possible problems, when in fact, the person in question wants to perform but does not enjoy it. \n5. Choice B is also incorrect as it states that \"talent persons cannot suffer...\". It does not address the question of what the person suffering from the problem. \n6. Similarly, Choice C, 'anxiety,' is incorrect because anxiety is a psychological disorder, which is not related to this question of an issue people with talent may face. \n7. Choice C is also incorrect because it states that \"Talent persons cannot suffer from...\". It does not give us any information about the person in question, whether they have talent or not, or whether they are suffering from anything. \n8. Choice D, happiness, isn't relevant because it isn't the case that someone with a talent can't be happy. \n9. Choice D does mention talent, but it's indirect \u2013 just suggesting that people can't be happy about talent. \n10. Choice E, \"energetic,\" has the same qualities of Choice D, and does not specifically address the person and their talent. \n11.

{"text": "flys', is a poor construction in logic. While it correctly identifies a false statement (talent persons cannot suffer an injury or butterflys), it does not help us understand which scenario the person in question is facing.\n5. Choices C and D, respectively, identify that the person suffers from anxiety or has joy/happiness. However, none of these emotions would prevent performing. Consider a skilled singer of great talent whose stage fright prevents them from performing. They likely suffer from anxiety, rather than joy. \n6. We finally have one of the choices left. Choice E, happiness, is not possible, either because the answer key describes that the person is likely suffering or because joy or happiness would indicate they do not suffer from anxiety. \n7. This leaves us with Choice B only as the correct choice, because Choice A is not possible due to its wording, and Choice C is ruled out due to its logical fallacy. Thus, the correct answer is B: Talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety and butterflies.\nAnswer: B: Talent persons can only suffer from anxiety and not butterflies\n\nInput: What types of tools do you need to get in order to start a fire? Choices:  C: flint A: starter B: water D: wood E: butane lighter\nRationales: The question is asking for the types of tools required to light a fire. We will breakdown answers as seen here and then compare and eliminate as necessary.\n\nChoice A, starter - This tool does not assist in creating flame, but rather provides extra materials on how to create and keep a fire. It could be used as educational tool to know how to start a fire from materials found in nature.\n\nChoice B, water - While water can be used to create steam which helps ignite fire, water itself cannot ignite fire and can in fact put it out once already established.\n\nChoice D, wood - Wood is a tool typically used to create fire by breaking down or burning a wood source material until it catches on fire. Anything that can help to create fire is a possible choice.\n\nChoice E, butane lighter - A butane lighter is a tool that contains butane and is used as a fuel on flame. This is the best choice because of its efficiency in creating fire when required", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because in addition to having a talent, the person in question is also suffering from an inhibition about performing. Thus, butterflies can't be the cause of the dilemma.\n5. Choices C, D, and E are related to psychological issues, which can be caused by a fear or dislike of performing. \n6. For this reason, choices A, B, and C do not directly relate to the problem, while choices D and E do, as they are both psychological issues that can be caused by fear of performing. \n7. Of the two relevant choices, choice D, 'anxiety', is a possible cause of the person's issue because it can be a fear-rooted reaction. However, choice E, 'energetic', could also be a cause as this psychological state is often related to fear, particularly fear of performing. 8. Therefore the best answer is E: energetic. \nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "fly', isn't a reason to suffer, it's kind of an explanation. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense because that's the opposite of suffering and so is a different issue altogether.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energy', respectively refer to psychological issues that could apply in this case but are too broad. We're looking for a more specific issue. \n7. Therefore, by considering Choice B, we can eliminate Choices D and C. This leaves us with Choices B and E. \n8. However, Choice E is too broad, as 'energetic' could refer to general emotions like happiness and joy and could not be specific enough. \n9. Choice B would be a good option if it was more specific, but since it includes the word 'and' with other explanations that don't fit the question, it is not valid. \n10. Therefore, Choice A, 'anxiety' can be the answer.\nAnswer: A. Anxiety\n\nInput: If you are searching for a particular item, and it happens to be in the basement, and you have no access to the basement, you should use what option to get it? Choices: \tA: try finding it B: call customer support C: forget about it D: ask someone for help E: call and tell the company who you are\n\nRationales: A) If you are searching for an item, and it happens that it is in the attic, you might have to climb to get to it, which is difficult, it's not a logical choice.\nB) Calling customer support can be a good choice, but it's an answer that is not helpful for a specific item that is in the basement, so it's inaccurate for the context.\nC) Forgetting about an item is not helpful for this scenario.\nD) Asking for help with this item is not possible, so it makes no sense as an option for this context.\nE) Calling the company and asking for this item is unlikely to work out, given that the item is in the basement and you do not have access to the basement.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "fly', does not make sense. It does not address what the person is likely suffering from.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', aren't unambiguous statements.

Choice E, happiness, does not correlate with the answer's requirement as performing isn't related to any type of happiness. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, would apply to the person in the position described in the question. \n7. We can eliminate Choice D, as a performer would not feel energy as opposed to anxiety. \n8.

Choices:  i: none ii: palms iii: sunflowers iv: plants that are not native to deserts v: many desert plants\nRationales: The question is about desert plants, which has multiple types of plants, one being the palm. Palm trees are native to deserts, so it's a good bet that they are a desert plant. There are other desert plants that are not native, so any one of the options could be correct.

What information would you hope to learn? Choices:  C: date of death D: cause of death E: cause of death F: where people were from\nRationales: To get more information, to visit a cemetery in search of more information about the family of a person, to examine gravestones.\n1. \"date of death\" could lead to the person's date of death, which might lead to additional information about the family. \n2. \"cause of death\" can reveal whether the person came to the grave through any kind of illness, or had a traumatic experience. \n3. \" where people were from\" you may identify a person's home country/township through birth information, and then look for genealogical connections. \n4. \"Family\" might help us identify parents with a connection to the grave.\n5. Therefore, we can eliminate options F, since this is not a very useful piece of information to have. 6. The best choice is choice 1: \"Cause of death.\"\n7.

{"text": "fliers', is correct grammatically, but if a talent person does not like performing, it seems unlikely this person would suffer from injury, or butterflies. Thus, this choice is incorrect. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't fit as a talent person could be very happy even if they were uncomfortable performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is relevant. Anxiety could be tied to performing, causing a talent person to be unwilling to perform in such a manner. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", is correct grammatically but is also relevant. A talent person who dislikes performing may still be talented and energetic. \n8. Eliminating Choice C and Choice E, we move on to Choice B, \"anxiety\".\n9. Therefore, Choice B, \"Anxiety\", is the right answer.\nAnswer: B: Anxiety\n\nInput: We must respect what our elders have to teach us because they are? Choices:  -A: children B: elderly C: young D: middle-aged E: children\nRationales: The passage asks us to respect what our elders teach us because they are children.\n1. Let us review each answer to see which one makes sense.\n2. Choice A, \"children\", does not make sense as adults do not have elders who are also children.\n3. Choices B and C, \"elderly\" and \"young,\" respectively, do not make sense as although our elders may be children's elders, they are not children.\n4. Choices D and E, \"middle-aged\" and \"children,\" respectively, do not work, either.\n5. Therefore, we can immediately eliminate Choices A, D, and E.\n6. Choices B and D, \"elderly and \"middle-aged\" still have some plausibility, but can be ruled out if we ask ourselves why our elders are children.\n7. We know adults do not respect the authority of their children because it is a role reversal. This means the reason for this can only be because adults and their children have similar life experiences, both being children once.\n8.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as the choice of 'talent' doesn't make any sense in that choice, nor does it sound like an appropriate choice. \n5. Choice D, `happiness`, doesn't make sense because why would being happy be connected to an unwillingness to perform? \n6. Choice C, `anxiety`, could make sense as anxiety can stop people from doing things, but it doesn't provide much detail regarding that. \n7. Choice E, `energetic`, could also make sense but it doesn't actually provide us much information as to what specifically they are energetic about. It's also too broad of a word and doesn't provide any further context to the question. \n8. Thus, we end up with two choices: 'anxiety' and 'energetic'. \n9. If we compare just those two choices we see that the former, anxiety, makes more sense. \n10. For example, a performer might have a fear of performing in front of others and feel anxious when they are about to take the stage. \n11. By comparison, the latter option, energetic, is vague and doesn't really give any more context to the situation than the prior choice. \n12.

This indicates we should be looking for a time reference: next fall, next semester or next academic year. It doesn\u2019t imply a yearly basis, so annual or semester are good choices here.\n3. Choices A and D both imply a time starting next week whereas next semester and next school year imply the start of September, respectively. \n4.

{"text": "fly', is not correct either. It does not imply whether performance art talent is what's being discussed.\n5. Choices C-E describe emotional states that do not describe the 'talent' that person would suffer from. They are also unrelated to a physical performance.\n6. It's also important to note that the question describes 'but does not enjoy performing.'. This also disqualifies choices C-E because they are all about enjoying something.\n7. This leaves Choice B: 'anxiety'.\n8. Anxiety can be a psychological condition that makes someone feel uncomfortable when in a potentially stressful situation.\n\n8. This describes what our person is experiencing, as it is difficult for them to get up on stage. \n9. Overall, the best plausible answer matches Choice B: Anxiety Disease.\n\nAnswer: B: Anxiety\n\nInput:  What is a way around a problem, problem for something that could solve it?

The question is using words that describe how someone \"gets\" around an issue. \n2. Choices A and B are not viable because they refer to negative aspects of a problem. \n3. Similar to the previous answers, Choices C, D and E all refer to \"how\" questions. That said, Choice E (solution) better describes the task at hand.\n4. Therefore, the correct answer is E: solution.   \n\nAnswer:  E: solution\n\nInput: The weather was nice. On Sunday, it was cloudy, the next day it was sunny once again, what day is it today? Choices:  today, yesterday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday  A: Saturday B: Thursday C: Friday D: today E: yesterday\nRationales: The given question refers to the previous day's weather. \n1. As the weather was nice, the weather in question cannot be \"nice.\" \n2. Choice B (\"Today\"), is incorrect as it does not describe the weather. \"Weather is nice\" can only refer to either \"", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "fly'', does not make sense. The sentence does not contain two separate statements; you are either suffering from butterflies, you are injured, or you are not. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\", does not make sense in the context, as you are not happy if you don't like performing; you are only sad or conflicted. \n6. This leaves Choices C, \"Anxiety\", and E, \"Energetic\", as the only plausible options. \n7. Choices C and E do have some similarity in that they involve the body/mind connection, however choice E, \"Energy\", is misleading; people are generally energetic, therefore, that is not the definition of \"energetic\".\n8. Therefore, choice C, \"Anxious\", is the most plausible in context.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: What would you recommend to someone who wants to become a pilot? Choices:  C: go to college D: join the army E: get a license F: buy a book\nRationales: The question asks what you would recommend to someone who wants become a pilot. Choices C and D are rules, and we need to recommend an option so someone would become a pilot. Choice E, \"get a license\", could be considered at first, but it's a requirement for you to become a pilot, which is contradictory to the question (\"What would you recommend to someone\"). Choices F, \"buy a book\", and C, \"go to college\", are activities, not recommendations.\nAnswer: C \u2013 Go to college\n\nInput: John, in an effort to raise awareness, chose to dress as an Eskimo, go to downtown and freeze in an Eskimo suit. It would be unlikely that he would not receive any attention. Why? Choices:  H: It is the only attention he would receive G: John was very attractive to females in Eskimo costumes J: He was walking around a city of people wearing Eskimo costumes K: John stood out from the general Eskimo community L: John looked silly M: His Eskimo costume was flimsy \nRationales:\n1.

{"text": "flys', doesn't apply as it is grammatically incorrect, containing a double negative. It is also nonsensical as it does not refer to people who are talented but shy. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not make sense in this situation as they have already been described as talent persons who are not confident performers. We need the opposite of that for the correct solution. \n6. Looking at the remaining choices, 'anxiety' makes the most sense as anxiety is a commonly held reservation about performing. People with anxiety will commonly feel nervous and may not have the confidence or self-assurance they need to perform well.\n7. Hence, we can deduce that 'anxiety' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C D: anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following statements does not describe the effect of smoking? Choices: 1. Your lung capacity decreases 2. There is more lung cancer 3. There is less oxygen entering your lungs 4. Your oxygen level increases 5. It can lower your immune system\nRationales: The key point to remember is that in this question is that smoking is bad for you.\n6. Looking at all the given options, let's find the one that can't be the effect of smoking. 7. Option 2, 'there is more lung cancer', is an effect of smoking because smoking is known to cause lung cancer. This is why it is an answer. 8. Option 3, 'less oxygen entering your lumber', is an effect of an unrelated problem, and not smoking. 9. Option 4, 'your oxygen level increases', is a physiological effect that is not connected to the smoking problem.\n10. We can now conclude that option 1, 'your lung capacity decreases', is the answer that cannot be the effect of smokers.\nAnswer: 1. Your Lung Capacity Decreases\n\nInput: The best way to use your computer is to? Choices:  a. keep it far away b. leave it turned off c. install updates d. check its coolant levels e. keep it in a secure location\nRationales: the trick here is that in the second part of the question, the correct choice will be an adjective that goes with computer", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "fly', isn't a reason someone wouldn't perform, and it gives no information on whether the person does indeed like performing. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\", doesn't imply an issue, nor that they specifically do not like performing. \n6. Choice C, \"Anxiety\", implies some kind of psychological issue that prevents or discourages them from performing. \n7. Choice E, \"Energetic\", doesn't imply or suggest that their personality is in anyway a restriction against performing. \n8. Therefore, by process of elimination, the answer is C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: What do you call when you have the worst day of your life? Choices:  (A) a bad day B) terrible day C) horrible day D) good day E) happy day\nRationales:  1. The question asks you call it when you have the worst ever day of your life. \n  2. This question implies it is possible to have a worse day than any previous day you've had.  \n  3. There are two words in the original question, \"worst day\", and we know that we are looking for an answer that describes something we don't want to happen.  \n  4. We know two of the answers are 'good day' and 'happy day' because this gives us the complete phrase \"have the worst day of your ______\".   \n  5. To rule out \"bad day\" and \"terrible day\", two answers which describe a positive time, we can use the phrase \"worst day\" to determine whether an answer is negative or not.  \n  6. If we put the questions in the order \"have you had the worst day of your...\" this gives us \"worst day of your\" which we can remove the questionmark from, leaving \"worst\" as an answer. As we know \"worst\" is negative, we then know that the other answer, that begins \"have the worst...\", must be positive and that we are looking for a positive answer.  \n  7. To determine whether any of the remaining answers are negative, we can remove the phrase \"have the worst...\" and reorder them to provide the phrase \"best day of your...\" which we can subtract from the question to show us the answer we'", "answer": " 66"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as it's a very ngram and the word's usage does not seem to pertain to the question.\n5. Choices C ('anxiety') and D ('happiness') don't describe an emotion; they describe states of being. In addition, anxiety is too extreme an emotion to describe a person who does not enjoy performing; they would be likely to seek more moderate emotions to describe their feelings rather than anxiety.\n6. Choices E ('energy') seems plausible at first - performing could be exhausting - but energy is not a symptom of not wanting to perform. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate C, D, D, E. We are left with choice A, 'injuries'.\n8. Therefore, we can confidently choose A: injury.\nAnswer: A : injury\n\nInput: A man was told he was in a _________. Choices:  A : hospital B : jail C : car D : bar E : restaurant\nRationales: Looking at choices, we know it is not 'hospital' or 'bar', so we start to eliminate those choices. \n1. It probably isn't a jail because of the words 'told' and 'in' together, indicating that he's not already in a jail.\n2. It'd probably not a restaurant because he has to stay inside somewhere. In addition, restaurants serve food, but not medical treatment.\n\n3. So, it's between car and bar.\n4. We know it isn't a bar, because he's likely not there against his wishes; he'd probably try hiding there, so he needs to be taken to the hospital, jail, or car. \n5. So, it'd be between car and bar, since he is 'told' and not 'asked'. \n6. But it doesn't make sense that it's a car because he has to stay in a place where the doctors can treat him.\n7. Therefore it's the bar.\n8. \nAnswer: B : Bar\n\nInput: Why would a business have to take out a commercial loan?

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because a butterfly can refer to a negative feeling or sensation. It can, however, refer, to how a person moves. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense in relation to a possible mental or physical reservation about performing.\n6. Choices C and E are both valid options, referring to anxiety and excitement, but the latter is the more relevant term here.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is choice E.

Choices: \n  A: accountant, computer program and legal consultant B: people with the same name \n  C: person with same experience as herself D: unmotivated people E: people who work only on weekends F: people with same character of her\nRationales:\n1.

{"text": "fly', while containing good logical reasoning, is too specific and does not address the full scope of the question.\n5. Consider choice C, 'anxiety', which indicates anxiety or nervousness that can stem from a variety of social situations or public interactions, including performing. This fits well with the question. \n6. However, let's look at choice D, 'happiness', which could indicate a negative feeling such as anxiety. Anxiety and happiness are not opposites - they're not mutually exclusive concepts. \n7. Now, let's look to choice E 'energetic', which is similar to choice B in that it also excludes all possibilities except for anxiety. \n8. But what about choice E again, 'happy'? Could it really mean they are an anxious person, yet happy nonetheless? While they are not polar opposites, they are antonyms. Antimony and symmetry, while related, are not the same. \n9. Therefore, by evaluating the options and eliminating those that do not directly address the question at hand, it is logical to select Choice C: 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: We need to know where to go eat after work, what do we do? Choices: \u2610 A: walk B: drive C: fly D: fly to Mexico E: fly to Europe\nRationales: The question asked where we should go eat after work which implies the destination is in or near us but is a different place to which we work. We work where we use our skills and knowledge every day and we also go to another place that is not our home for food. The choices are: A) walk, B) drive, C) fly, D) we can't get this meal after we work because we are out of the country (E).

{"text": "fly', is incorrect because although someone with a talent can't suffer an injury, another person can be talented and also suffer from 'butterflies'. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", does not make sense either, as 'talent' is a vague enough term that it could apply to anything. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", stands out as possibly an appropriate choice because it is closely related to performance anxiety. \n7. Although 'anxiety' could describe a 'nervous' person, as the word 'butterflies' connotes, this is not necessarily true.\n8. Someone could be extremely talented in what they perform but still suffer from anxiety before a performance, so it can apply to both meanings.\n9. Hence, the option that makes sense is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C, \"anxious\"\n\nInput: Which of these is a true fact about penguins? Choices: .\nRationales: The question is asking about an animal.\n1.

Choices D and E, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', do not make physical sense, as it is often understood that anxious and anxious people tend to be nervous, whereas happy and energetic people are usually emotionally and physically healthy.\n6. Choices B and D make good sense and therefore, it's best to choose Choice D, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: What did the baker have to do for the cake, to use in his bakery? Choices:  a: bake b: decorate c: transport d: deliver e: all the above\nRationales:1. The question asks about what the baker would have to do for the birthday cake he would want to sell to the bakery.\n2. Considering the answers, we can look at the meanings and relate it to the context of the situation, i.e., baking.\n3. Choices a, 'to bake' and b, 'to decorate' do not make sense. If our baker wanted to bake the cake, he or she would have to do all the work on the cake. Decorating or transporting would not be an issue.\n4. Choices c, 'to transport' and d, 'to deliver' are similar and it is a matter of personal preference whether one chooses to use transport or delivery. Transport in this case could mean transferring the cake from one place to another.\n5. Choce e, 'all the above,' has a very literal meaning and, therefore, does not make sense here.\n6. Hence, the choices to be further looked at would be a, 'to bak,' and c, 'to transfer.'\n7. Choice c, 'to transfer', does not make sense in terms of baking as baking is not a process that involves the physical transport of the product from one place to another, but rather the act of producing something from scratch.\n8. Choice a, 'for to bake', makes sense because the term 'for' is used to denote the purpose of a specific action. Hence, to bake is the specific reason why this is to be done.\n9.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "lies', is also not likely to be correct as it doesn't answer why a talent might not enjoy performing. 5. Choice C'anxiety', does fit the description as anxiety is a psychological issue. It is possible for someone to struggle within a performance, feeling nervous or tense, even if they are talented and enjoy it.\n6. Choices E 'Energetic' is also a possibility fit, although maybe not as strongly. You can be 'energetic' and still have some anxiety if it's about performing. Also, not all performers are energized during their performance.\n7. We can consider why a person with anxiety about performing could affect their enjoyment. The answer B, 'anxiety', is an explanation to this effect. Hence, this explanation is likely to be more useful than the others as it is concise and clearly provides a reason as to why a performer may experience anxiety despite their talent.\n8. Therefore the best answer is B, 'anxietY.'\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: Which part of nature is not on land and does not fly or swim, but travels under the sea?

{"text": "fly', seems odd by suggesting that the person's talent specifically is immune from injury or anxiety. However, if you remove the qualifying portion, this reads as 'talent persons cannot have injuries or butterflies', and suggests that the word 'talent' is referring to the whole, and not some subset thereof.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', are logical answers for people who have difficulties performing. \n6. However, if you combine Choice C, 'anxiency', and D, 'Happiness', it makes more sense. \n7. Therefore, by eliminating Choice B, 'Talent persons cannot suffer from injury and Butterflies' and Choices A, B, C, D, E, we are left with two choices for answering the question.\n8. Choice E, energetic, does not seem to be a symptom of a reservation about performing.\n9. Therefore the best answer is Choice D, 'Happienss', which suggests that the reservation is related to positive emotions.\nAnswer: D.

The glycogen levels drop E: 1. The cells cannot use glucose at the same rate\nRationales: Looking at each line, we can quickly eliminate some choices. 1. Choice C, \"the effect of insulin on the cells may decrease\", is the best answer as it covers the key part of our task, to describe how blood sugars decrease after eating sweets over a short time. 2. Choice A, \"the bloodglucose concentration is decreases\", is not an accurate or relevant answer and neither is Choice D, \"glycogen levels decrease\", because glycogen is not a type of sugar and doesn't relate to blood sugar. 3.

{"text": "fly', while somewhat accurate, is not a complete sentence. Thus, the idea of 'butterfly' doesn't make sense.\n5. Choices B and C (anxiety and happiness) also aren't exactly applicable to this question. While these are both psychological states, they do not specifically relate to performative talents. \n6. Choice D, anxiety, makes sense, as performance anxiety is a common phenomena and could affect a person's ability to enjoy performing.\n7. Choices E, 'energy', doesn't relate here because it's an energy state, rather than a feeling or emotion that could affect how one feels about performing.\n8. Therefore the best answer is D, anxiety.\nAnswer: D, anxiety\n\nInput: What does it mean if you are feeling ill and a pimple forms? Choices:  L: pimple is a disease  E: pimple is an infection  A: pimple is contagious  B: you are sick  C: it'll get better\nRationales:\n1. I am feeling ill and what does it mean?\n2. As you understand from the context, the main topic is \"what does it mean if your pimple pops up\"? The answer option should therefore be given according to how ill pimple pops out.\n3. Choices L, E, and A, \"Your illness becomes more serious\", \"You feel serious illness\", and \"Having illness shows up\", respectively, are related to disease, sickness, and infection. Since pimple doesn't lead to illness, we can eliminate these three options.\n4. We can find in Choices B and C, \"You feel sick\", \"You feel contagious\", since pimple may have similarities with contagious disease, including HERPES, PIMPLE, and BIRTHMARK, since we get these by contact.\n5. According to the context, none of these three options is the correct answer. However, Choices B and C seem to be related a bit so eliminating one of these answers will reduce the possibility to B.\n6.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense either as it does not express the concern with performing and is too general to cover the case being implied. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense in this context either, as happiness can be experienced at any range of emotions, rather than being an indication of a specific fear or anxiety. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, does make sense, however, because it points to a state of tense or uneasy feelings that can be a potential barrier to performing. \n7. Choice E, enthusiasm, is too broad a term and doesn't align with the type of anxiety that would keep the specific person from performing. Ultimately, the best answer is choice C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C, anxiety.\n\nInput: Which is bigger, the smallest known galaxy or largest planet in our solar system? Choices:  D: the smallest known galaxy E: the largest planet in the solar system\nRationales: If you think about the difference sizes of a galaxy, the smallest one, and the largest planet in our solar systems, it is clear that the largest planet is bigger. Anything with larger size needs to be considered as the answer.\nAnswer: E, the largest planet in the Solar system.\n\nInput: Is it possible to find and use multiple answers to the same question?

The only thing implied is that we are looking for a word that could mean both \"find\" and \"use\". However, the colon is a punctuation mark used to show that one thing (an answer) leads to another thing (a question).

{"text": "fly', seems a stretch as it is not a choice to pick, but rather a phrase out of context. \n5.

This leaves us with a choice between C: anxiety and D: injury, both of which pertain to emotions. \n7. Anxiety, however, fits best to the specific circumstance, as a person may not like to perform due to feelings of nervousness and/or stress. \n8.

Hold the turtle'stail, and put him in the jar.\n\nRationales:\n1. This method will work if you have a turtle that is too young to live without food. \n2. To get the turtle into the jar, first fill the jar completely with water, leaving just enough room for some air so you don't suffocate the turtle. Then, take the turtle in one hand, put his head under one hand, and pinch his neck just behind the jaw. This makes him loose control of his muscles, and you can push him over the lid of the jar with less risk of his getting injured. \n3. This method will work for turtles whose shell is cracked.\n4. This method will work with older turtles.\n5. This method will work without harming the turtle.\n\nAnswer:\n1. There is a misconception about turtles.

Given that we have eliminated at least two choices, we should consider further the options that remain to be less inclusive and more likely to be describing the person in question as they do not fit the description given in the question. \n7. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019 would suffice for the question since the person has reservations about performing, and anxiety is a mental condition which often occurs in such situations. \n8.

We can deduce this by eliminating the incorrect answer choices. If the \u201ccold tongue\u201d is caused by dry air, then the presence of water would cause dry air to leave our environment. This is unlikely.\n\nBecause \u201csome people\u201d experience this sensation, \u201chigh humidity\u201d is not the best answer. \u201cDry weather\u201d is not consistent with the definition of high humidity, which requires water vapor to be in our environment.\nAnswer: The correct answer is C: Cold air\n\nInput: What term is used to describe a technique that is useful to enhance", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as the question is looking for a state of mind, and being talented is more of an inherent quality. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", isn't an issue - if someone is talented and happy, they would likely enjoy performing. \n6. Choice B, \"anxiety\", is a possibility, given that someone might have anxiety about performing a skill they aren't confident in. However, it's not exclusive to the question since the person enjoys some aspects of performance and is not suffering from anxiety. \n7. This leaves us with Choice E, \"energetic\" as the best viable option. \"Energetic\" sounds like the person experiences excitement when facing challenges. This could be the case for someone enjoying performing, since they are challenged to perform to their best abilities.\n8. Therefore \"energetic\" is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E. energetic\n\nInput: When a car's radio is not working, what is likely to happen? Choices: 1. A: The door won't open 2.

Choice B, the 'radio won't work', doesn't make any sense if the car already has a radio, suggesting that the 'radio' refers to all cars radio - which is not possible.\n2. Choice C, the 'car will die', doesn't make much sense as the radio in a car is powered by the same source as the car itself, suggesting that both should work. \n3. The same reasoning applies to Choice D, the 'air won't stop'. The reasoning behind that the radio will not operate suggests that the car itself will still be functional. \n4.

{"text": "fly', is a nonsensical phrase made from incorrect words, and doesn't make sense as an option to the question.\n5. Choices C, D, and E are all psychological states and fit the definition of what the person in question could be experiencing. \n6. Looking at Choice C, 'anxiety', however, the question does not describe a state of physical anxiety. So, while it's plausible that the person may be experiencing performance-related mental anxiety, it's not described in the question.\n7. Choices D and E both describe psychological experiences that would naturally relate to an individual who experiences psychological anxiety and emotional reservations about performing. Choice E, happiness, could refer to the person's experience of performing, but it's also not specified as to the type of performing experience (for example, in a theatrical or musical performance setting). Choice E, therefore, does not necessarily provide a strong link between happiness and performing.\n8.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense since the person is specifically not enjoying performing, so they probably don't have talent in the first place based on the first choice choice. \n5. Choice D, happiness, can be related to performers sometimes being happy. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is related to performers being anxious. \n7. So, the two best choices are B and D. \n8. However, only one person can get injured, but in answer choice A, the person is specifically not injured - and this information is available through the context. It is not sufficient to identify them as injured based on the statement in the question. \n9. Hence the best answer is either A or B. \n10. In answer choice A, it is mentioned that the person does not like performing, and there is no indication that they have other performance related talents that they are able to enjoy. \n11. There is no information in the question that allows us to know for sure, as the question is phrased, but it seems more likely that they only have performing related talents that they do not enjoy performing. 12.

{"text": "' is not plausible as it doesn't make grammatical sense. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is an unrelated quality, as the question doesn't directly reference happiness. \n6. Choice B, C, and E are all closely related to performance, and all of them are generally not undesirable qualities. \n7. Conveniently, we can eliminate choices B, C, and D, and then look closer at E, 'energetic'. While 'butterflies' in the incorrect choice is a reference to nervousness, 'energetic' seems a likely response to anxiety over performance, making it seem like an appropriate choice. \n8. Therefore, \"energetic\" would seem the best answer. This does fit in terms of performance, though, so we want to try to explain why this is an undesirable quality.\n9. There are two main types of energy. There is kinetic energy, which is energy moving around in space. Kinetic energy can be transferred to someone who's bored or unprepared, as they may come across as inefficient or rushed. \n10. The second type of energy is potential energy, which is energy waiting to be released, kind of like a spring that is coiled and ready to spring open. \n11. We can use this'spring' analogy to explain the undesirable nature of energy. For example, a coiled spring that is used, and in doing so releases its energy, can still spring away even if released, returning to its coil form. Therefore, while an energetic person might release their energy in a performance, they are not completely used up, and can then still act energetically. \n12. So, an 'energetic' person is not one who is always calm and poised, but rather only appears to hold true control and self-awareness until something disturbs that. \n13. Therefore, we can now narrow down our answer to either C: anxiety or D: talent. \n14. Anxiety tends to indicate a level of nervousness, which fits, but could also explain many of the other choices as well. \n15.

{"text": "fliess', is a nonsensical phrase. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not in alignment with the context described because it is an abstract, philosophical principle and not a physical or psychological state. \n6. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B and D (unless the person has actually been injured). \n7. So, let's go with Choices C and E. \n8. Choice C, anxiety, is quite close to what the question is describing, but there is no guarantee that someone with anxiety disorder does not enjoy performing just because they have anxiety issues. \n9. Therefore, we can look at Choice E, having to do with feeling energetic (i.e., enthusiastic). \n10. Although feeling energetic generally indicates a positive attitude, it doesn't automatically guarantee that someone with this disposition enjoys performing, as feeling \"energetic\" can come from many sources \u2013 perhaps even just from the enjoyment of music or art. \n11. Therefore, Choice E is a correct answer but not the best. \n12. Let's pick the answer that better fits the context for having an enjoyment/affection for performing or, lacking that, at least a level of comfort performing. \n13. So, looking at Choices C and E, we see that E more accurately refers to feeling energetic, while C more directly relates to performing. \n14.

{"text": "fly', while the idea is funny, doesn't fit with the text that the person would be suffering from reluctance to perform a talent. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense in this context as the person isn't happy performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, doesn't make since as anxiety or nervousness are typically expected when performing - one would not suffer through anxiety to perform if they didn't like performing.\n7. Choices B - D all relate to the person having reservations about performing.\n8. This leaves to us select choice E, 'energetic'. This choice is incorrect in the question because we are asked for an 'ailment', not a 'condition', and an ailment can be physical or psychological. However, while 'energetic' may suggest energy, it does so in a way that's not clearly defined - it is not limited to physical energy or movement, and it could be related to a psychological state. \n9. Choice B, however, also refers to psychological energy, in the form of reservations, and is directly related to the issue that the person in question is dealing with. It is not the most specific answer, but based on our elimination of other choices it is the most appropriate.\nAnswer: B: reservations concerning performing\n\nInput: What's usually considered a type of food item?

{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense as talented people aren't a biological category, only a characteristic related to skills they possess. \n5.

'Energy levels' can fluctuate based on moods, circumstances and other factors. \n10. But 'energy levels' can also be affected by how one feels before performing, which is consistent with the sentiment conveyed in the question. This is also why it makes sense that 'energetic' is often used as a synonym for 'energize' or 'energized' (i.e. performing), as it taps into mental, emotional and even physical energy - key qualities to consider when preparing for a performance.  \nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 448000"}
{"text": "fly', is too specific and doesn't account for other mental reservations about performing.\n5.

We can also eliminate one choice that is not quite what we are looking for because it is still a noun. The adolescent is someone who is becoming, they are not yet fully developed into their mature self. The same thing goes for the word idiot, the correct usage of the word idiot means that the speaker is saying that the person in question is not mentally challenged but instead is someone who is simply unintelligent. None of these can be what the question is asking, so we will try to define the word with the other two words. We can eliminate B and E. B is an adjective and E is an adverb. Neither of these things is relevant in this question. By definition the answer is C. A genius is someone who is extremely or highly intelligent. Genius is a trait or a quality, it is a word.

This question is referring to a theatre performance, where promoting would mean raising general awareness of the production in order to increase audience numbers. \n2.

Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'ecstatic', are not related to the question. \n6. Choice D, which suggests the person is happy, is the correct answer as this is a positive sentiment related to performing. This is confirmed by the question as the word 'butterflies' in answer D can be read literally as feeling anxious while performing a skill.\n7. Therefore it's fair to conclude that the answer is D: they feel good about performing, and happy at performing.\nAnswer: D Explanation: C D E\n\nInput: If you don't make it in time to get your train, you will end up getting on which of the following? Choices: 1. The subway A: train that came before 2. The train that came after B: train that came earlier C: a later train heading in the same direction D: the next train E: an earlier train heading in the same path \nRationales:\n1.  There are many different ways to get to the same place at the same time\n2.  There is an 'if' word in there which means it is an educated assumption that the train the person is hoping to reach will not be their train\n3.  Not making it to the train, assuming the train is not their train, may change the direction they are heading in\n4.  The best answer is A: The subway because in an effort to catch the train, the person will likely take the nearest available form of public transport\nInput: The shadows are lengthening, it could mean what? Choices: A: The sun is going down B: The sun is coming up C: The sun is moving to the west again D: The moon is going down E: The sun is rising \nRationales\n1. Shadows are generally not moving\n2. One could say it is going down or going up\n3. These are very arbitrary and not helpful to the question\n4. The only sensible answer is the one related to time of day: A: The sun going down\nInput: I've got a friend with a good sense of humor, but she seems to have a little problem that doesn't interfere with her life", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "fly', seems to support the question as it directly links a talent to a potential issue related to performing.\n5. However, by reviewing the structure of this term it is actually describing an uncommon phenomenon where those 'with talent' experience both emotional and physical anxiety. \n6. Therefore, it does not make sense to support the question and we should eliminate it.\n7. Choices C and D, happiness and energetic, respectively, may be relevant since the question refers to an issue relating to a potential lack of enjoyment while performing but these words do not directly link to the context of performances in general. In addition, these words are also uncommon in the sentence structure, making it more likely that they are not the intended answer. \n8. Thus, there is reason to believe choices C and D do not fit well with this question.\n9. The best word to use would be Choice E, 'anxiety', as it describes an emotional issue.\n10. Therefore, the answer to choice E: anxiety.\nAnswer: E; anxiety\n\nInput: To what are scientists studying the causes and treatments of dysthymia?

Review all of the options for each of the letters to determine what might make sense.\n2. Considering the first letter: M and H. H refers back to human health, so it might be considered an applicable option, but it is probably less accurate than M.\n3. Reviewing the second letter (H): C (Mental disorder), D (Medical issue), and E (Psychology) could all be correct.\n4. Consider the fifth letter: A. M and H are both possible, and thus A could technically be either of these choices depending on the context.\n5. Looking back to the first letter (M): Mental Disorder describes mental illnesses or disorders, which is not necessarily the same as Mental Health, specifically. Since Mental Disorder makes the most sense within the context of the letter A, it is reasonable to assume Mental Disorder is the second letter of", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": "flys,' is an unusual phrase that does not make sense in context, and isn't directly related to the question. \n5. Choice E, enthusiasm, does not necessarily have to do with performing, as it can refer to all types of activities, not just the performing arts.\n6. Choices B and C, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', aren't logical because even those who are not afraid or joyful may find performing difficult (e.g due to not having confidence, not being well trained or not knowing the material).  \n7. So, we are left with A and E in contexts that might be related to the question.\n8. However, the second half of the question (but doesn't like performing) suggests that there is a connection between what the talent person struggles with and what they do not like to do, which implies that the problem has a direct impact on performing.\n9. Therefore this indicates the ability to perform is limited to the person's happiness with the activity, rather than other causes of anxiety, energy or happiness.\n10. This suggests we should eliminate choice E, as it has nothing to do with how much enjoyment the person experiences.\n11. Thus, Choice A, 'anxiety', should be the right answer.\nAnswer: A :anxiety\n\nInput: Where would you use up more energy during a long commute? Choices: 1 : A: on a train 2 : B: on a bus 3 : C: in a car 4 : D: in a truck 5 : E: none of these\nRationales: This question requires knowing how much energy is required to power a vehicle. \n1. We know that a car uses up more energy than a train.\n2. We also know that using up more energy usually causes the object to be hotter. \n3. Looking at the options: \n4. Choices A and C, 'a train' and 'a car' are both cars, and thus don't fit. \n5. In a similar vein, choices B and E do not fit as the context is commuting, and neither the bus or the truck are common ways to commute. \n6. Choice D, then, should be correct as it uses more energy and gets hotter during the commute.\nAnswer", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "flys' doesn't make sense as it could suggest that only people with physical handicaps are allowed to have butterflies. \n5. Choice D, like choice B, is missing a lot of key information. \n6. Looking at Choice E, 'energetic', we can assume that this word is being used as an adjective. \n7. That means that we need to consider nouns that would fit with energetic. \n8. Looking at Choice C, 'anxiety', it fits with energetic well because anxiety is an emotion, similar to energy. \n9. Therefore, we can eliminate the other answers. \n10. This leaves Choice C, 'Anxiety', as the answer.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: After all of the testing has been concluded, what is the likely outcome for the patient?\n\nChoice A: death\nChoice B: surgery\nChoice C: better off than\nChoice D: disease\nChoice E: cured\nChoice F: unchanged\n\nAnswer: 'E'\n\nRationales:\n1. Out of all the choices, 'unchanged' is the only choice that fits the description of: 'What is the likely outcome of the patient?' Unchanged means no change is expected. Therefore, all other choices are incorrect because they all represent a changed state.\n2. 'Death' is the worst-case scenario and definitely not likely. Surgery is unrelated to testing.

{"text": "fly', is too specific as it implies that only talent persons cannot suffer from both injury and butterfles, which is unlikely. \n5. Choice D, happiness, could be a factor, but we are looking for something a person has to deal with, specifically when they are performing, not a person is generally feeling about life. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, could be related to performing. However, it's not likely the only reason for their hesitation as it's often a general, ongoing mental state, not a specific obstacle associated with performing. \n7. Choice E, energy, could be related to a lack of energy causing a person to not want to perform, but once again, this is likely just a contributing factor, rather than the only factor they are dealing with when performing.\n8. Therefore we can rule out the more specific choices and narrow down the answer to more general choices.\n9. Choice B \"Injury and butterflies\" is a possible explanation but the best choice is Choice C, 'Anxiety' as it is the most fitting choice that describes the state of being that could possibly cause a person to fear performing. \n10.

First, the question asks about the nature of chicken soup, specifically why one might eat it. Thus, to properly answer we must look at its ingredients and what it offers.\n2.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because this is saying that the only reason somebody may not like performing is due to anxiety, which doesn't make sense as it is not a physical issue. \n5. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, is not a suitable response. While someone may be happy despite not having a talent, people without talent are usually not happy about it (otherwise, why are they even questioning their lack of talent?). \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, doesn't seem to apply as it is a form of psychological distress not related to performing in the way the question seems to assume.\n7. Now, let's look at the remaining choice, E: \u2018energetic\u2019. The clue is that the performer is possibly talented about performing, so this is a possible candidate for the correct answer.\n8. In this circumstance, the person may just need someone to nurture their talent. This is where the mentor/apprentice relationship comes in.

{"text": "fly(s)', doesn't make sense as a person can't be a talent person and also suffer from an injury or a butterfly. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not likely as it may seem unrelated. However, looking more carefully, we can determine that the context in which this choice is made makes it reasonable. \n6. The question is asking if someone has a talent for performing, and if their talent is not performed, they suffer as a result. \n7. Happiness is dependent on talent having opportunities to perform, which would not be the case if they didn't have that talent. \n8. Therefore, by this rationale, we can conclude that someone who is talented but doesn't like to perform may suffer from anxiety.\n9. Therefore the answer is B, anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: The police have the responsibility to arrest people that have been convicted of a crime. Choices:  A:(not valid) B:yes C:no D:arrested E:forgiveness\nRationales:\n1. The question is \"The police have the responsibility to ___ people that have been ___ of a crime.\" \n2. By the question, we are given that the police have a responsibility but not the other terms. \n3. There are two required terms to complete the sentence.\n4. Choices B,D,E and Fare not valid because they don't fulfill the required terms. \n5. Option C, \"no\", is likely not the correct answer because people who have been convicted of crimes require arresting. The law enforcement is to arrest and prevent crime from happening, arrest is a part of it. \n6. We can eliminate Choices B,D and E because these terms don't include \"arrest\" or \"convicted\". Choice F, forgiveness, is out too because forgiveness doesn't fit.\n7. Choices B and D are similar in that they include arrest but they don't include convicted people. \n8. As there are two required terms, we should eliminate them both and choose Choice C, which includes \"convicted\" people.\n9.

Choices D and E, 'butterflies and injury', could be another way of describing stage fright.\n7. Choices D and F, 'anxiety or injury', are too vague \u2013 an injury could in fact be related to stage fright, making it not a 'butterfly'.\n8. Choice F uses 'and', which rules them out.\n9.

The sentence contains the subject 'the scientist' and the verb 'created'. \n3. Choices A and B are grammatically incorrect as they involve no subject or no verb. \n4. This narrows down the choices to: Choice C,'she did the investigation'; Choice D,'she made the drink' and Choice D, 'they made the illness'. \n5. Comparing 'they made the illnes' to Choice D, we can understand that 'the illness' refers to the sickness itself. \n6. Thus, Choice D appears to be correct. \n7.

So a word used as an ADVERB in this grammatical sense refers to a word that is used to modify another word that modifiers A word.\n4. So the question is saying: what does it mean when a 'word' is used as an ADVERBE?\n5. Therefore, if it is going to use the 'ED' method of telling if a word is an ADVERBE, it is a word that is used as an ADVVERBE.\n6.

Choice D, happiness, doesn't describe a person who dislikes performing but rather enjoys it. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is the correct answer because it matches the question: the person possibly experiences anxiety and doesn't enjoy performing as a result. \n7. Choice E, energetic, doesn't answer anything relevant, so it can be eliminated. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: A friend who's a clown has always loved the theater. What's another word for a performer who entertains people by making them laugh? Choices:  D: humorist E: clown F: comedian G: entertainer H: entertainer\nRationales: This question asks for an alternative term for a clown, which is a type of performer that can entertain people through humor. This question will help you identify the appropriate term for another type of performer. \nInput: Which of these adolescents would make the best ___, in your judgement? Choices:  B: spy C: actor D: friend E: scientist F: president\nRationales: The question here asks for the adolescent who would make the best [blank]. For this question, you do not understand the entire sentence. This is not an independent sentence. Instead, it is a fragment of a sentence that is used to identify the most likely answer to the question based on the context it provides. \nIn this case, the entire question is: \"Which one of these adolescences would make the best [noun] in your judgement?\" The context clues from the question are: \"which,\" \"of these,\" and \"in your judgement.\" \nInput: John is a ___; he never knows the odds because he always does his very best.

Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'butterflies', respectively, are the best options. The question says that the person is probably suffering, so it would not be appropriate to say the person suffers from these things, which is why we're looking for a negative version of this (i.e. 'does not suffer').\n7. Therefore, we can deduce the best answer is Choice D, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: I'm having a bad headache, what can I do to relieve it? Choices:  D: sleep it off,  A: ignore it B: take a pain pill C: put an aspirin on it E: drink an alcohol drink\nRationales: Option D: To'sleep it off' means that they should sleep and allow the headache to go away.\nOption A: To 'ignore it' means that they should not notice the headache because it may or may not go away.\nOption B: To 'take a pain pill' suggests that they should take an aspirin. This is not the same as taking an aspirin which is option E.\nOption E: To 'drink an alcohol drink' means that they should take an alcohol drink. This may provide headache relief or make the current headache worse.\nAnswer:\nAnswer: C: put an aspiring on it\n\nInput: On an essay exam, you can't just make it up, you need to research it thoroughly.

{"text": "fly', is a grammatically incorrect and repetitive way to express the same idea, so it's not accurate.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', don't make sense for this question because while these emotions may affect ones performance, they are not the primary point of this question. \n6. Choice A, \u2018butterflies\u2019, is an expression that is akin to feeling anxious or nervous. But, if someone didn\u2019t like performing, they would probably feel an unpleasant emotion beforehand. \n7. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019, is a type of emotion, but it is not directly tied to issues with performing. \n8. Therefore we have the answers narrowed down to A, \u2018injury\u2019, and D \u2018happiness.\u2019  \n9. Although injury makes sense, the wording of the question indicates someone who feels uncomfortable performing, not limited by physical health. When a performer is out of shape, they may not be able to fulfill their desired role or their performance may be lackluster. \n10. But, for the above mentioned person struggling with performing, it would not be the result of an injury per se. \n11. Therefore, if we can eliminate another answer then the best answer would be D: happiness. Choice D describes this specific situation best in that one is simply not happy with performing. \n12.

Considering the other choices, 'anxiety' and 'happiness' are the only possibilities that fit the context of the question. \n7. 'Anxiety' sounds more likely as an explanation here, so we select it as the best answer.\nAnswer: A & C: injury and happy\n\nInput: Of the eight cities in a state, what was the name of the largest?

Choices: A: lunch B: scolding C: a hug D: a pizza\n\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about the possible consequence of a dog eating homework.\n2. Considering each of the choices, Choice B,'scolding', makes sense because a dog eating home could reasonably prompt a scolding, especially if it was intentional or had caused damage.\n3. Choices A, 'lunch', and D, 'a pizza', don't really fit as they are not the kind of rewards that a dog typically gets.\n4. Choices C, 'a hug', doesn't make sense either because a hug is not something that could be given or received after consuming homework.\n5. Therefore, Choice B, scolding, is the best option.\nAnswer: B: scolding\n\nInput: Of which of the following does a pony most closely relate? Choices: A- Dog B- Horse C- Elephant D- Zebra E- Sheep\nRationales: -This question is asking which of the following is a mammal. Let's look and the options to see which one is most closely related. -The first four choices are all mammals, but only the elephant and the zebra are not horses. So, the answer is elephant or zebra. -But the context of the question suggests we are asked about a horse's relationship. So our answer is elephant.\nAnswer: A. Elephant\n\nInput: Which of these was invented by the Greeks? Choices: A. Automobile B. Bicycle C. Train D. Calculator E. Sailboat\nRationales: A. The Greeks did not invent the automobile.

{"text": "fly' is not a feasible option, as it doesn't make sense to phrase it this way.\n5. Choices D and E, 'Happiness' and 'Energetic', are not apt responses to the question because they are not related to performing, rather life as a whole.\n6. This leaves us with choices C and B.\n7. Let's now look more closely at the two remaining possibilities. Both options discuss anxiety. Anxiety is a feeling of fear, uneasiness or apprehension about something, but does not necessarily prevent someone from engaging in a particular activity. \n8. Therefore, Choice C's phrasing makes more sense, as a person with anxiety could still act on the talent they have.\n9. Therefore the answer we should choose is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C : anxiety\n\nInput: If a student has finished with math course, then they may seek further education, which type of institution would they use to complete this? Choices:  B: high school C: college D: university E: trade school\nRationales:\n1. The student has completed math, thus their next step would be to continue with their education, either formally, or informally.\n2. As such, their best option is to pursue college studies.\n3. Looking closely at the possibilities, option B, 'high school', is incorrect because one cannot attain a college degree at a high school.\n4. Option C, 'college', is the answer we are looking for as it is most directly related.\n5. Option D, 'university', refers to an institution offering higher education as well, but it can be attained at many levels. Therefore, if the student is at the college level, attending the university would not necessarily constitute further education.\n6. Looking at the other possibilities, option E, 'trade school', is misleading because it refers to a vocational school, and is not what the student is looking for.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is C: college.\nAnswer: C - college\n\nInput: I bought a book ______ I have a test for math.

{"text": "fly feelings,' is not an actual choice but rather written in the sentence. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't seem relevant to the context because happiness is not a feeling that would impinge on one's performing ability, nor does it seem like the person would fear being unhappy after their performance. \n6. Choice B, C and E all make sense, as all of these emotions could affect a person's ability to perform. However, only one of them makes sense in light of the question. \n7. Based on this, it's reasonable to conclude that the correct answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: People who like baseball do not generally enjoy watching basketball. But, people who enjoy basketball often show an affinity for baseball. In this case, what is affinity? Choices: \n A: something for which a person has great regard \n B: a general dislike of sports \n C: not a fondness \n D: a reason why someone plays a specific sport E: a way to measure how much someone likes the game\nRationales: Affinity can be defined as \"any natural predisposition for the appreciation of\" or a \"strong liking of someone or something\".  By way of example, it might include a fondness for a particular sport or a fondness for a certain person. \nLooking at choice D, \"a reason why someone plays a particular sport,\" is likely too specific.  We can eliminate this answer and consider just the choices left. \nIn this case, it's likely that the people who have an affinity for baseball will find basketball less enjoyable. That being said, people who like basketball will probably find baseball just as enjoyable (or even more so). \nTherefore, the correct answer to this question is B: \"a general dislike for sports\" or \"not a fondness.\" \nThis is a reasonable answer because it is most likely that the people who want to watch baseball would not enjoy basketball.  This is because there is a general, general dislike of other sports among people who love baseball. \nIn this sense, those with an affinity for baseball have a strong inclination to like baseball.\nAnswer: B\n\nInput: While I was playing, I was accidently elbowed by a teammate.

{"text": "fly's', doesn't make sense as nothing is stated before it, so the answer doesn't seem plausible. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not make sense because this question is not about happiness, it is about anxiety. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, does not fit as it doesn't indicate a dislike of performing a talent. \n7. Therefore, out of the remaining choices, A is the most plausible explanation. Option B could potentially be interpreted as a person can suffer from both injury and butterfliedness, but this is not specifically stated, making the interpretation unclear.\n8. Further review reveals that in the question's context, A is the most probable answer. That is, if a talented person does not like performing, likely due to anxiety, then A, Anxiety, is the correct answer.\n9. Therefore the answer to the choice that best fits is, Anxiety.\nAnswer: D.

Choice D, ''happiness'', is also not relevant as it doesn't indicate the level of participation in a performance from the point of view of interest to the question. \n7.

My mom thinks it is a cure, therefore there is a reason for this answer choice (my mom).

{"text": "fly', makes no sense as the two phrases have nothing to do with each other except the one word 'talent'. Also, while these phrases may occur together, the phrases don't match the given context of performing. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is not pertinent to a choice that can be used to describe the given context, because though happiness can impact a person's decision to perform, it does not speak to feelings or emotions. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is something a person with performing talent might experience, but only if anxiety also refers to feelings or emotions as they may relate to performance. For instance, someone who suffers from a stage fright may experience feelings of insecurity while performing.  \n7. This leaves Choice E, 'energetic', the best answer. \n8. Choice E makes sense here, as someone who suffers from stage anxiety, which could be characterized by a lack of energy, would likely have a low energy personality, or they would be energetic. \n9. Therefore, Choice E makes most sense as the best answer.\nAnswer: E. energetic\n\nInput: To understand how someone is feeling, one needs to focus on their?

Focusing in on the question, we start by eliminating irrelevant options.\n3. Choices A and B do not make sense as someone's eyes or brain would not normally give away that they are feeling a certain emotion.\n4. Choices D and E are vague as they do not refer to a specific focus in regards to emotions, meaning they aren't the best options.\n5. Choices F and C are both good options, and a quick comparison of their words helps us to determine which is more appropriate.\n6. While the word 'feelings' sounds similar to 'feeling' in Choice C, in Choice F the word 'feel' is used. \n7.

Choice C, \"anxiety\", sounds right but consider this: could a person be anxious about performing? Perhaps if their performance was for many people. But if it was a solo performance only, they're usually under stress about what to say or how do to their task. \n7.

Choices:  C: Bulls B: Oxen C: ox D: cow E: pig\nRationales: The question states that a bull is a species, inferring that it is an animal. \n1. Let's start by eliminating the two incorrect (and obviously incorrect) answers, B and D, which are not species of animals. \n2. The questions implies it is an animal to which the species bull (or ox) can belong. \n3. Considering this, if a bull is a type of bull, then the only appropriate animal to which it could belong as a part of its species is C. There are many animals that can be bulls such as horses, cows, ox, and buffalo, but they are also cats, rabbits, and elephants. \n4.

So, we are left with choices C and B, where anxiety may prevent performing, or a person with a talent may find performing too difficult, or both.\n8.

If they only do it because they love performing, then they may face no stress or anxiety. This suggests we should look for something that would indicate a more extreme dislike.\n7. Consider choices, 'anxiety' and 'energetic', both of which suggest a form of anxiousness. In this context, they both refer to different types of psychological reaction to performing.\n8. As such, we can reasonably assume that 'energetic' is correct as it provides a more specific, direct answer choice to the question.\n9. Therefore the choice is E: energetic.\nAnswer: E, energetic", "answer": " 72"}
{"text": "fliess', is confusing given that 'persons' is clearly a collective noun and refers to a category, not a specific individual. Further, an individual may have talent but their talent need not be related to performance, such as in the case of an individual who may have talent at painting, music composition, writing etc. \n5. Looking at Choice C, 'anxiety', does make sense in this context. People who have a natural fear of performing will likely not enjoy such performances.\n6.

Choices:  (A) The mountain (B)The panda (C)Being mountain (D)Being bear (E)Being mountain bear\nRationales: Input: 1. The bear is an animal that typically eats plants and meat. \n2. If bears wander in mountains, it means they are living and roaming outdoors.\n3. The animal known as bear is not one, it is two. \n4. Being mountain (C) is not correct as it is not the name of an animal but a description. \n5. Being bear (D) is not correct as being bear means living a wild life.\n6. The bear is a bear but bear is not a bear. This means that the bear is the bear but the bear is not the bear. \n7. This leads to conclusion that the bear is different from the bear and the bear is the bear. In that way if the bear is living in the mountains then bear is the one who is living in the mountains which could be bear.\n8. It follows that there are two bears namely, bear and bear who are living in the mountain, being mountain and being bear.\n9. This makes bear as mountain bear because bear belongs to both the bears namely, bear being bear and bear being mountain bear.\n10.

A: move to a safer location 2. B: get out of the kitchen 3. C: fly away 4. D: eat the apple 5. E: go out the window\nRationales:\n1. A moth is an insect that is attracted to light, and will typically be found near windows, particularly in kitchens or other areas where they can get close to a source of bright light.\n2. Moths have a very high sense of smell and are attracted to certain scents, which makes sense as they are often found near sources of light, like windows or doors. \n3. Moths also have a very high sense memory and can recall traps, smells, and other experiences that will prevent them from becoming trapped.\n4. Moths are nocturnal and usually active at night, so would likely not fly away or eat an apple if the lights were off. \n5. If the lights were off, the moth would most likely be scared and hide, as they do not like being in dark places where they can't find their way around.  \n6. Therefore, the most logical choices are 6 and 7, as they indicate that the moth would most likely react to the presence of bright lights, and would then most likely try to find a source of safe darkness.\nAnswer: D, E\n\nInput: The kitten walked up to the owner, why does it seem to be so friendly?

They are more likely become better person Choices: 1: TRUE 2: FALSE 3: FALSE 4: TRUE 5: TRUE 6: FALSE\nRationales: Let's break down the answer choices: 1. They are selfish. Selfishness is related to the tendency to prioritize one's interests to the exclusion of others, which is an unreasonable character trait for most intelligent people. We all know people who are smart, and many of them are empathetic and community-minded. Thus, it is clear that this character trait doesn't apply.\n2. They know how manage their time.

{"text": "fly', is an unrelated analogy, and its plausibility is questionable. \n5. Choice D, ''happiness', doesn't make sense as a talent typically refers to a skill of the 'arts' variety, not a skill of the'science' variety. \n6. Choices C and E do not mention a talent, so they can be excluded. \n7. Hence, it can be concluded that the best answer is D, 'anxiety'. \n8. 'Anxiety' is a psychological concept, which aligns with the question's premise about an emotion related to a psychological reservation of someone with a talent. \n9. Therefore, option D stands the best.\nAnswer: A. Anxiety.\n\n### Sample Question 6\n\nInput: The person's dreams were often ______ because of the insomnia. Choices:  A; frequent B: often C: rare D E: no relation\nRationales: In the question, we can deduce that the person had insomnia, which probably resulted in a problem that is mentioned in the blank. Therefore, _________ 4. To select the best answer of the choices, it is essential to understand all options before making a final conclusion.\n\n5. When the word \u201cinfrequent\u201d is used in a sentence, it can be interpreted to imply a lack or insufficiency of occurrence. Alternatively, \u201cfrequent\u201d can be interpreted to portray a lack of rarity. Thus, any occurrence of the word \u201cfrequent\u201d would imply less rarity, a lack of insufficiency in occurrence, and thus frequent occurrence. \n6. Hence, the best answer is \u201cinfrequent\u201d.\n\nSample answer: The person's insomnia resulted in frequent occurences of his disturbing dreams, so they were often infrequent because of the insomnnia.\nAnswer: Infrequent\n\n### Samples Question 7\n\nInput: When you want to know the answer to a question, you should ask for the ______.

This indicates that it is asking for a n", "answer": " 349"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense either, neither is it a logical argument. The person could still enjoy performing the skill in question, despite being injured. \n5. We can also eliminate Choice C, 'anxiety', as anxiety is a mental or psychological condition, not a physical one, and performing is usually a social interaction. \n6. Choices D and E can be eliminated in this step as well, based on the fact that they don't directly relate to a performance art, such as singing, dancer or acting, but rather other aspects of life. \n7. Therefore, we have narrowed it down to choices A and B: talent and anxiety. \n8. Now we can consider what causes anxiety in the context of performing: we know that it is the fear of failing when performing, which is a psychological or mental issue. We can also eliminate options related to physical or emotional problems. \n9. Therefore, we'll choose option A, as it makes the most logical sense and it has the best relation to the question: 'If someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, they are probably affected by what?'\nAnswer: A: anxiety\n\nInput: With which season does the weather change the least? Choices: 1. A: spring B: fall C: summer D: winter E: none of the above\nRationales:\n1. Note: the question asks which season the weather changes the least with, not which season it changes most. \n2. Considering this and the choices given, we can choose between \"fall\", \"winter\", \"summer\", \"spring\", and \"none of the above\". \n3. However, fall and winter are the only seasons that are known for major shifts in weather. This further implies that both \"none of these (as not defined) and \"spring\".\n4. Therefore this further narrows our options down to only two.\n5. In the question, it also states that the weather in each season changes a lot. Consider the choices B, \"winter\", and E, \"none of the above\", and note that while they do technically match with the question, it could mean that the weather changes as much or more in these seasons as it does with \"spring\". \n6. This further suggests the options C, \"summer\", and A, \"spring\" make more sense.", "answer": " 70"}
{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense as this phrase is grammatically incorrect and doesn't relate to the scenario. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not a logical option as it doesn't explain why talent individuals would have a trouble performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is also not correct as it would still lead to performance concerns; such as nerves and stage fright, which could still potentially prevent someone from performing their talent in a public setting. Thus, if someone is talented; yet, they do not perform, they suffer from some form of performance anxiety or hesitation.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is Choice E: energetic. \n8. Energy or stamina can be used to express how active someone is, particularly someone who is performing regularly or a professional. \n9. Additionally, people who are talented but avoid stage performance can sometimes have a fear of being too energetic and overpowering an audience. This also ties into the previous answer where someone is reluctant to perform on stage. \n10. Therefore, the best choice is Choice E: 'energetic'.\nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 96"}
{"text": "fly', seems silly and unlikely, as talent isn't a biological, physical aspect.\n5. Choices C, D and E, 'anxiety', 'happiness', and 'energetic' respectively, all describe possible psychological outcomes for a person; however, they do not necessarily relate to performance.\n6. Choices A, B, and C could all indicate a person's feelings of unhappiness and dislike when performing, leading to anxiety or depression. \n7. However, by removing these answers from consideration, we are left with what seems to be the best answer, choice: D: 'happiness', which suggests that they enjoy the activity but are scared of not doing well in front of an audience.\n8. This is supported by the text \"talent but doesn't like it.\"\n9. Hence, the answer is D, 'happiness'.\nAnswer: D: happiness", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "fly', can be eliminated as it doesn't make sense given the question and the word \"injury\" is used instead of \"injuries\". \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", can be eliminated because happiness and anxiety are not correlated. \n6. Choice B, \"anxiety\", is ruled out as it's too broad in meaning. It's not necessarily a negative state of being or emotion as the question implies.\n7. Choices C through E are all related to some degree to anxiety or mental disturbances. \n8. Choice E, \"energetic\", has the right contextually, but this trait doesn't seem to be inherently connected to a lack of psychological enjoyment of performing.\n9. Finally, Choice D, \"anxiety\" sounds like it's the closest answer if only because it's the final possible choice left, even if it's not entirely accurate.\n10. Therefore, the real answer is D: anxiety\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: Some men wear socks and underwear together, but should it, it's not typically accepted outside of what? Choices A: the gym B: the mall C. the bar D. the work place E. the park\nRationales:1. The question is determining whether someone should be wearing socks and underwears together. \n2. The choices are A to E, all relating to how someone can wear their socks and underwearts.\n3. Choices C, 'bar' and E,'mall', are out as places where men should wear socks and undergarments to. \n4. A and D are also out for the same reason.\n5. B is a different place and this is a relevant response to the question, but it would be too distracting to mention as an incorrect answer.\n6. Therefore, as we can deduce that the answer cannot be B as this isn't where something like this should be worn but is a place where it's okay to do so, this leaves either A or E.\n7.

Choice D, and E, 'dance' and 'easy' respectively, can both be eliminated because they do not adequately describe what this person is experiencing.\n6. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'happiness' respectively, can also be eliminated because they don't adequately describe why a person might not want to perform despite talent. \n7. Choice B is also irrelevant because there is no mention of a 'talent persons' being suffered.\n8. Therefore the best option is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: A B: anxiety\n\nInput: My sister was a good gymnast. She also was on the cheerleading squad. This meant? Choices:  I. She was a natural  II. She hated cheerleading  III. She was a jock  IV. She was a witch V. All of the above\nRationales: The question specifically states that in addition to being talented, a gymnast, being on the cheerleading squad meant that she must be a jock.  A jock is a colloquialism for someone who is into sports, including gymnastics.  Being on the cheerleading squad does make her very sports-loving, but, the fact that she was an accomplished gymnast indicates that she was a natural athlete. Therefore, the best response is III: She was a jock.Answer: III: She was a Jock\n\nInput: People can learn math from their teachers, but math teachers are not required to be math students.

Therefore, teaching is not for everyone, because not all people can teach.\nIt is obvious that teaching is hard, unless a person intends to not teach properly and instead to teach bad.\nFurthermore, math teachers are not required teachers, because they can teach math or they can teach anything in order to be teachers.\nMath can be taught by anyone, because math teachers do not require being a math student, so it\u2019s enough for them to", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "fly', is implying that a person suffering from anxiety is likely also talent, which is an unsupported statement. \n5.

Choices B and D are also not true as talent persons can suffer from anxiety and butterflies. \n7. Choice E doesn't fit either as it doesn't make sense to say 'but they may be energetic,' when it is already stated that the person has a talent.\n8.

The question is about how to describe someone who thinks they are the one and only capable person.\n2. Looking at choice S, we see it is a person characteristic, likely of a single person, so we can eliminate B: funny, C: bossy, and D: kind.\n3. Further more, these three choices are very general and do not relate to the subjective ability of someone to perform well personally.\n4. Choices A and E, both describing a person as evil, also likely do not apply to an individual who is simply overly confident in themselves.\n5. Left with S: good, S: bad, we can now eliminate choice E (bad) as the person could easily view themselves as a good person, regardless of their ability to do anything.\n6.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect because a person who suffers from anxiety or butterflies is not necessarily 'talented'. \n5. Choice B, in contrast, 'talent persons can suffer from anxiety and butterflies', is incorrect because to be a talent person you need to possess the talent. \n6. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense as it doesn't directly relate to the person suffering from the inability to perform. \n7. Choice E, energy, doesn't make the most sense either because it does not explain what type of negative emotion is preventing the performance. \n8. Let's next consider if any of the chosen choices makes sense in combination with the rest. \n9. Choice A, anxiety, is a psychological condition related to performance, but it does not cause performers to avoid performance - instead anxiety would make them avoid the thought of performing under the fear that they will perform poorly. \n10. There is no emotional link between a person with anxiety and performance avoidance.\n11. Choice B, talent persons can suffer from anxieties and butterflies, may seem at first to be the correct combination. However, performing anxieties and buttered feeling are different. Buttered feels don't cause a person to perform poorly or avoid performing, they simply may feel uneasy before performing - making it more likely that they perform well. So this combination does not make sense either. \n12. Choice D, a feeling of happiness, is correct in that a person who is happy is likely to perform. However, this does not mean that they have 'talent' and this does not explain why a person would perform poorly or avoid future performance.\n13. Therefore, it's clear that Choice C, 'talent', is the best answer.\nAnswer: C. talent\n\nInput: If it's very hot outside, you should drink?

This is also implied by the other answers, which focus on fear and anxiety rather than happiness. \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019 is an appropriate answer, as it is often associated with fear or worry, which would be relevant for someone who has a performing talent they are uncertain about and therefore experience anxiety. \n7. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019, does not seem like an appropriate answer for this case as energy is typically described as a good thing, and while it is implied the person in question is performing, it is more likely they are performing out of fear, which is considered negative or less optimal. \n8.

But the show they were watching was not the same as the carnival show. This implies they were the audience in a more general sense.\n2. The most important piece of information in this question is that the audience were watching a carnivale show but they were not watching the carnival for their benefit.\n3. The question assumes that the audience was watching an entertainment show, but this is not the focus of the question, so we can discard the irrelevant information.\n4. The carnival is a show which would normally be watched for entertainment, so it is not necessary.\n5. The festival is a place that normally would hold fun activities and entertainment. If the audience was watching a festival then it could be the event they were watching but that is not specified.\n6. The circus is a place where people perform various performances.

Nurses look after patients after they have visited a doctor or they are providing medical treatment, so they don't fit this need.\nChoice E, \"nutritionist\" is also incorrect.\n\n2. The word \"see\" indicates a personal meeting. A person won't look up medical professionals to determine their feelings of tiredness, they will meet with these people in-person.

What's left is an emotional response. \n8. Choice E, \"energetic\" is the best possible option. It is a feeling, a mood or an overall state, and it is also related to an ability to perform.\n9. Therefore the answer is E: energetic. \nAnswer: E: energetic \n\nInput: My friend could have told me her husband died, but she refused to do so, why? Choices:  She wanted to surprise me She thought I wouldn't understand what happened She thought I would go out and get into a fight I wouldn't go with her She knew I would react poorly\nRationales:\n1. The question is stating that her friend refused to tell someone that her husband died, but could have.\n2. We need to look for reasons that would not have made her want to tell or what might make her be reluctant.\n3. She could have gone out so, the options that don't relate to her desire to stay at home would not make sense.\n4. Someone thinking you wouldn't understand what they are saying or talking about wouldn't prompt them to keep quiet.\n5. Surprising you doesn't make sense when it comes to death.\n6. Someone who thinks you would go out and fight is not a good idea when you are someone's friend.\n7. The last option is one of the only ones that makes sense.\n8. Based on the context of the question, the answer is: She knew I would react bad\nAnswer: B: She knew I would React Badly \n\nInput: Which of these best describes a group of people who are on a team?

{"text": "fly' isn't correct because, as the phrase suggests, it is not possible for a talent person to suffer from injury, either due to the nature of a talent or the nature of not being injured.\n5. Choices C, 'an anxiety', and D, 'happiness', are not a suitable answer as they do not relate to performing in a talent environment. The only choice left is choice E: 'energetic'.\n6. Energetic refers to having an abundant supply of energy. Not liking performing in a talent environment might be caused by a reluctance to using that talent, resulting from a lack of energy.\n7. Therefore the answer is E; a person without a talent but has a talent but doesn't perform may be energy. This makes sense, as energy is required to perform at a high level.\nAnswer: E:\"energetic\n\nInput: A group of animals, especially tigers, lions, leopards, and cougars, constitute? Choices:  Cougars Choices:  A : a roster B: a crew C: a tiger D: a lion E: a gang\nRationales:\n1. The sentence makes it clear that we are looking for a name for a group of animals here with a focus on tigers, lion, etc.\n2. Choice A is the name of a group of animals, but it is not the name of a group called 'cougars'.\n3. Choice B is the name of a boat, which is a ship used for traveling across water. In this sentence, the group of animals are on land, not traveling on water.\n4. Choices C and D are names of particular animals, but they do not refer to a group of animals, especially of the types described in this sentence.\n5. We are looking for a particular group, so we should eliminate every other choice.\n6. The only choice that makes reasonable sense as a name of a group of these animals is choice E: the group of these animals is called a \"gang\".\nAnswer: C: A gang\n\nInput: If a bird is not able to fly, what will happen to it?

{"text": "flys' doesn't make sense, as it doesn't fit the context and it's not a possible response as it combines two unrelated things. \n5. Choice B, \"anxiety', isn't it. Anxiety is caused by stress, fear and pressure, which can only be experienced as a human emotion. A talent is not a human emotion, so it can't be caused by anxiety. \n6. Choice C, \"happiness', also doesn't make sense. The talent mentioned in the question doesn't necessarily imply that the individual feels happy about it. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", could be correct, as it aligns with the act of performing. However, it does not align with the context given - if someone is talented but uncomfortable with performance, it is unlikely they would behave in an energetic manner.\n8. Choice D, \"anxiety\", aligns with both the context and the given information. Anxiety can be caused by the pressure of needing to perform in the spotlight, creating both a stressful situation combined with emotional stress, which may make someone less keen on performance. \n9. Therefore, we should select Choice D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D; anxiety\n\nInput: You can get a great deal on this item you want to purchase, however you must be prepared to drive all the way down to California to get it, what is this item?

There is no mention of a service. \n3. Looking at the choices. \"Car,\" \"TV,\" and \"Computer\" are all good items. \n4. \"none of these\" does not make sense: it means no choice at all. \n5. \"Camera\" also does make sense. \n6. Therefore, the answer should be \"Cameras.\"\nAnswer: C: camera\n\nInput: I asked several of my colleagues about the subject they know most about, which of these are academic subjects, choices: a: history, c: english, b: geography E: math, d: none", "answer": " 37"}
{"text": "fly's', doesn't make sense as it is literally the same as the previous answer. \n5. Choice E, \n'energetics,' isn't a psychological condition that an individual could have. \n6. This leaves us with choices C and D. \n7. Choice C, \n'anxiety,' is a mood disorder commonly experienced by people, and is frequently related to stage fear. \n8. Choice D, \n'happiness,' would be an unreasonable response as people without talent could suffer from happiness and still enjoy performing, and similarly, someone with talent could be unhappy about performing. \n9. Therefore, it is reasonable to say that the best answer is C, \n'Anxiety.'\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: A cow, horse or any other farm animal is a what? Choices: A: bird B: bird C: bird D: mammal E: bird\nRationales: Choices B, C, and D are all incorrect because they list birds and that's not the question's request.\n1. The question is specific and the answer must be as well.\n2. Choice A is incorrect in that while farm animals are mammals, only one of them (the cow, not the horse) is a bird.\n3. Choices E, and B are both animals but that's still not the question's need because we are looking for a term that fits the following options.\n4.

{"text": "fliess', doesn't make sense either as it is not a specific medical affliction, nor a common complaint among performers.\n5.

Therefore, choice D, 'anxiety', is the best answer.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety\n\nInput: A good way to learn to drive with a standard is to do what? Choices: A: start learning with a standard B: start learning with an automatic C: keep practicing on a standard D: practice and learn together E: learn to stop and start\nRationales:1. The question is looking to identify a good way to learn to do with a standard.\n2. Choice A, starting with a standard is correct, the others are incorrect because they are not part of driving with a standard.\n3. Choices B-E, starting with an automatic, keeping practicing on a standard, practicing and learning together, and learning to stop and start, respectively, are incorrect because they do not pertain to learning to drive a standard. \n4.

{"text": "fly', doesn't convey that they can't enjoy performing as well. Neither does it make sense that their anxiety would cause an injury. It's also too wordy.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', are both potential emotional hurdles to overcome in regard to performing. However, both are more likely to impede enjoyment than physical injury. \n6. Choice D, option E, is talking about energetic individuals. \n7. Therefore, they are not the best answer choice because while energy and positivity can help an individual overcome a performance hurdle, energy and positivity aren't what the question specifically asks. \n8. Thus, among the remaining answers, Choice E, 'energetic', is the most likely to be correct.\nAnswer: D, 'energetic' as an energetic individual might be more likely to overcome the anxiety or negativity associated with performance as their positive outlook and high energy might encourage them to push through it.\n\nInput: Everyone agreed Tom did something wrong. Who can be blamed for the outcome? Choices: \nA: Tom B: Rob C: the other two D: everyone\nRationales:1. This question asks who can be blamed for a specific outcome.\n2. Looking at Choice A. Tom did something wrong, but did he get blamed for the outcome. This implies he is a bad listener. But why would bad listening lead to getting blamed?\n3. The next Choice is B. Rob said something and everyone agreed. This is saying something went wrong because of Rob but nobody is blaming Rob. That leaves everyone else.\n4. Choices C and D refer to the other two but don\u2019t say anything about being blamed.\n5. Thus, the only choice left is Choice B.", "answer": " 250"}
{"text": "fliess', is a statement describing the inability to suffer from something that isn't related to talent, such as an injury, and does not describe a psychological issue. \n5. Choice E, happiness is also eliminated because it is unrelated to an issue the person is having performing. \n6. Therefore, we are left with 3 possibilities: anxiety, injury, and energetic. \n7. Anxiety is a mood, a feeling, which doesn't seem to be what the question is asking about. \n8. Injury is also a mood, a physical state, not a psychological one and it doesn't make sense as there is no psychological connection between injury and performing. \n9. Therefore, we can conclude that, by process of elimination, the choice that makes the most sense in this context is Choice D, 'anxiety'. \nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: Who has the capability to be more talented than someone else? Choices:  None A: themselves B: others C: nature D: other people E: no one\nRationales: The question asks which option can be the most talented. Answer C, \"nature\" cannot be more talented than anyone else because it is an inanimate object. In addition, nature does not actively do anything, thus it cannot take part in any talent-related activity. Answer D: \"other people\" cannot be more talanted than anyone else because there could potentially be multiple other people with an equal level of talents. For example, if one person can dance better than another person, then multiple other persons who are similarly skilled could potentially also be equally as capable of dancing. Therefore, the answer that makes sense in the context of this question is Choice A, \"themselves.\" The word \"themselves\" implies that it is possible for anyone to be talented at something if they focus and practice hard enough. It does not narrow the range of candidates, and one could potentially be talented in many ways. Therefore, the answer \"themselves\", makes the most sense logically because it covers the maximum amount of possibilities and is the most direct answer. Answer: A: themselves\n\nInput: Which answer could be used to best summarize what people think? Choices:  Each of them are equal C: they all care the same D", "answer": " 1500"}
{"text": "fly', does not make sense as an invalid condition. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not an emotional condition, and the question does not indicate that the individual suffers from happiness. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is generally considered a psychological state rather than a condition. \n7. Let's consider the remaining options. \n8. Choice E: 'butterflies', does not fit as it does not have any connection to talent or performance art. \n9. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is mentioned earlier as a condition that does not fit the requirements. \n10. Looking at the remaining options \u2013 \"energy\" and \"energetic\", we can see that these terms do not make sense given the provided information. Thus, we should choose the one that is incorrect. \n11.

Choices:  Medical Field A: Nursing B: Ophthalmology C: Dentistry D: Family Medicine E: Veterinary\nRationales: The question is asking for the field of expertise for a doctor who is also a family doctor.\n2. While there are different types of doctors within each of the given fields, this specific doctor is a family doctor, not a nurse, an optometrist, a dentist, or a veterinarian.\n3. Therefore, any answer within that is valid.\n4. Choices A and C are not mentioned, so they are invalid.\n5. Choices B and D are invalid since we know this is a family doctor, while it makes sense that this expert would attend to these fields in their practice, that doesn't mean they are necessarily \"family doctors.\"\n6.

{"text": "fly', is not incorrect, technically speaking, but it lacks focus and doesn't capture the specificity required to answer the question. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is out as being a pleasant emotion is not the same thing as not enjoying performing. \n6. Choice B, \"anxiety\", is also not the intended emotional state.\n7. Choices C and E are both related to specific types of emotions, but neither is a reason for a talent person becoming reluctant to be a performer. \n8. Therefore, choice B, \"anxiousness\" is the possible reason for why someone might not enjoy being a performer despite having a talent.\n9. Thus, the correct answer is B: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: A cougar is an ape but not a primate, in what scientific field do we need to place a cougar? Choices: \nA: evolution B: biology C: ecology D: physics E: all science fields\nRationales:\n1. The question is concerned about how we classify the cougar. \n2. To make sense of the question we should first break down all the given information into distinct, individual pieces, considering each piece on a technical level. \n3. A cougar is considered to be both an ape and a cat, but not a primate. \n4. Therefore, it follows that the cougar is neither \"evolution\", \"biology\", nor \"ecology\" but somewhere in between, meaning \"both\". \n5. \"Primates\" and \"Apes\" are both considered to be classifications that fall within the scope of the \"biology\" branch of science. \n6. The question is asking what type of science is specifically the cougar. To answer this question we need to look for an answer that is more specific than \"biology\", specifically, into \"primates\". As a cougar is both a cougar and an ape, the answer that follows is, both \"biology\" and \"evolution\". \n7. \"Physics\" and \"Ecology\" are not relevant to the question because they are scientific fields that are not specific with respect to the cougar.\n8. The only reasonable answer is that a coug", "answer": " 11"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because there is no reason why a person's talent would hinder their ability to suffer from an injury or anxiety (butterflies are not psychological disorders). \n5. Choice E, while 'energetic', isn't a psychological issue so it doesn't make sense either.\n6. Therefore, the best option is Choice D - anxiety. \n7. It makes sense because anxiety isn't a physical barrier to performing, but can certainly impede a person's enjoyment of their performance art. \n8. As a result, anxiety fits the question fairly well and is the best option. \nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: My mom has this amazing shaving cream, it is ______ and has the most ______ smell and is very ______.

Choice E, also a logical fallacy, states that 'if a person is happy, then they can't be suffering from an energy constraint'. \n6. Choice D, while seeming logical, does not really make sense and is actually related to the 'talent persons cannot' from Choice B. So, Choice D is a flawed answer. \n7.

{"text": "fly', is a grammatical error, the word 'and' has been placed in the wrong position, which renders it meaningless. \n5. Choice A, in its own right, cannot be a reason someone suffers from anxiety or has butterflies. \n6. Choice B, although grammatically correct, doesn't make sense as a \"person who has talent cannot suffer from anxiety\" indicates that \"talent persons\" are free from anxiety, but this doesn't describe the individual with a talent. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\", fits as an answer; however, from the context, we know that the person in the question does enjoy performing, otherwise, they would not question their talent when performing. Thus, we can eliminate \"anxiety\" from the choices. \n8. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense; the question is asking for an explanation of what is going on with the person who is suffering from butterflies, which is \"butterflies\". \n9.

{"text": "fly', is wrong in multiple ways: if a talent person had an injury, they wouldn't be performing, and butterflies are a natural phenomenon that doesn't mean something can't experience them - such as anxiety or happiness.\n5. Choices C - E are all related to mental states, including anxiety (C), being happy (D) and being energetic (E). \n6. Looking more closely at the question, we can see how the 'injuy' part of the question is used to explain why the person would not be performing. As such, one of these options that includes the word 'anxiety' would make the most sense.\n7. In this context, it also makes sense how 'people cannot suffer from butterflies' - they wouldn't experience them if they were performing. \n8.

Choices:  A. fever B. sore throat C. headache D. weakness E. infection\nRationales: Given question is intended to be about the patient's symptoms, the words \"had to tell\" would imply urgency. Furthermore, the use of \"what was wrong\" indicates the issue at hand, not the patient's name. Thus, the nurse would request the patient's symptom, rather than something less relevant. The answers have all been arranged in order of how relevant they would be to the request. \n\n1. There is no reason for the nurse to mention the term \"fever\" unless there were other symptoms that could be attributed to fever. The word \"fever\" is also broad, but the questions states \"what was wrong\". For this reason, it is not a valid answer to this question. \n\n2. Answer B is not entirely irrelevant, but it is unlikely that someone who had a sore throat would need to tell the nurse this, particularly if their other symptoms were more serious. If a person has a sore throat, they may report this to the nurse, but it is unlikely they would require the nurse to inform them of this. \n\n3. Headache: This answer may also be relevant.

{"text": "fly', is grammatically incorrect and also not a suitable option because people might suffer from injuries from a performance not related to talent, for instance falling from a pole on stage. \n5.

Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, provides a possible reason for the person not liking performing for others. It may be a sign of nervousness and stress about the performance or the spotlight it brings, which could lead to a lack of enjoyment for the person. \n7. Choice B, \u2018Happiness\u2019, is too broad and does not provide a specific reason for why the talent-y person does not like performing. \n8. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019, is not specific enough and does not provide details about what exactly this person does that makes them not like performing. 9. Choice B stands out as the most likely answer. While it doesn't explain in detail why the talent-y individual does not enjoy performing, it provides a reasonable explanation as well as some plausibility. \n10. Therefore, the answer for this question is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: Someone in a wheelchair must face what obstacles to do they do outside?

{"text": "fly'. It's not possible to suffer from two different things at once! The second part of the sentence makes no sense.\n5. Likewise, choice C, 'anxiety', doesn't fit because anxiety doesn't necessarily prevent one from performing.\n6. Choices D and E, 'Happiness' and 'Energetic', also do not fit. \n7. Therefore, it must be either Choice B or Choice D, 'talent persons can suffer from injury butterfly'. 'Talent persons can suffer from butterflies' makes the least sense, which means the answer is Choice C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C anxiety\n\nInput: What did the scientist use to analyze and study food that would taste great? Choices: 1. A: food 2. B: laboratory 3. C: microporous plastic 4. D: thermometers 5. E: food scales 6. F: oxytetracycline\nRationales: The question asks the scientist how he or she analyzed the food that they or she was working with. They used microscopes to analyze and study food.\nNote: Scientists use microscopes to examine samples. Therefore, we need to think about what they could possibly study with food.\nExplanation: 1. The laboratory is a common place where we study food but it is not a place where someone can conduct an experiment. 2. We use thermometers to measure changes occurring within a sample but not all food has to be heated. 3. Microporous plastic is used to conduct analyses of air quality but that doesn't make sense here either. 4. Oxytetracyclines can be used to treat food-borne illnesses but a laboratory is not a place where that type of food would be handled or eaten. 5. We can use scales to measure quantities of our food as opposed to measuring the taste of the food. 6. We would be using food itself such as meat and fish to study how they respond to different treatments. \nNote: It is possible for a person to study the food that he or she ate. \nExplanation: Food itself cannot be examined. \nRhetorical strategy: Elaboration\nNote:", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "fly', isn't a real statement. \n5. Choice D, doesn't make much sense in relation to the wording. 'Energetic' is not a psychological reservations as it relates to energy. It is more about mental endurance, as some people are more energetic and enthusiastic versus other people who may be more quiet in their manner. A person may not enjoy performing due to shyness or timidity, but not because they are 'energetic'. \n6. Choice C, is the type of anxiety that prevents someone from enjoying performing. If someone is anxious by its definition it is likely to affect their desire to perform.\n7. Choices E, 'happiness' doesn't really mean 'anxiety', only that person suffering from happiness may actually be performing to avoid their anxiety. Therefore, the best option is Choice C, 'anxiety'\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: The boy with the red shirt is the oldest of all his siblings. Which is the right order of their ages? Choices: 1.

{"text": "fly', has a similar error - it refers to a person with talent but, again, it doesn't make sense to be suffering from a psychological reservation. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't what this question is hinting at - if they were happy and not talented, they may not want to perform. The answer is not D: happiness. \n6. Choice C, Anxiety, is too specific to the question - it is implied that the person is talented and does not like performing, but they do not have an anxiety about performing. \n7. The only answer left is E: energetic, which makes sense because the question implies that they have a talent which they are not willing to partake in public performance. \n8. Therefore the answer is E: energetics\nAnswer: E: energetic \n\nInput: What would be the most sensible response if I am looking for a cake? Choices: \n A: give me two cakes, please B: thank you\n C: are you sure?  D: here's one E: one cake would be fine\n Rationales: 1: Look at the first sentence. It contains a pronoun \"I\" 2. It means that the person is looking for a cake and is in a situation where they can ask for one. 3. It is a shopkeeper's point of view. 4. Choice A:  \"Give me two cakes, pleast\" does not make sense. 5. Choice B: \"Thank you\" means that the person is very satisfied or happy. So, this is not the most sensible response. 6.

{"text": "fly', may be close to the correct answer. It could be, but it would imply that only performance-talented individuals have anxiety since those who don't have a talent suffer from 'injury and butterflies'. This isn't necessarily required. \n5. Choice D, happiness, makes no sense as unhappiness and talent both aren't necessarily mutually exclusive, and therefore neither happiness nor unhappiness defines the person.\n6. Choices C and E don't make sense as they don't logically correlate to either talent or performing.\n7. This leaves Choice A, 'anxiety'. It's a relatively common and reasonable psychological trait. It would cause the person in question to express reluctance in performing. \n8. It doesn't have anything to do with 'butterflies' which, unless they have to do with performance anxiety, are irrelevant to the question. \n9. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: A-D: anxiety\n\nInput: A book has been turned into a movie, what is it called? Choices:  C: a book A: a movie D: the book E: the movie\nRationales: The question is asking name this thing when it is turned into a movie.\n1. The first step should be to find what this thing is called\n2. Choice A states that \"a book\", which is a book, is a movie. This doesn't make sense to the context of the question.\n3. Choices B and D both state that \"the book\" is a movie, which is false.\n4. Choices C and D both state \"a movie\", which makes sense in context, but do not distinguish between \"a book that's turned into a movie\" versus \"a movie called a book.\"\n5. Therefore, by eliminating the choices that aren't correct they are left with: Choices B and C.\n6. Choose the one that states that the \"a movie\" is called \"the book\", which is what the question wants.\n7. \"The book\", therefore, is the answer.\nAnswer: D. the book\n\nInput: In what order should books be shelved?

{"text": "fly', is not related to the question being asked. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't relevant to the question. \n6. Looking at what is left, we can narrow down the choices. \n7. If someone wants to perform, but does not, they might be reluctant due to a fear of failure. Thus, we need to choose an option that is related to such a fear. \n8. Choices C and E refer to feeling nervous or experiencing anxiety. Thus, the correct answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: The student's paper lacked in depth and was overall weak, which of the following is the definition of the word, poor? Choices:  D: lacking richness or density. B: lacking depth of information. A: shallow. E: limited. C: understated.\nRationales: It is logical to infer that a weak paper shows poor quality, so 'poor' would be the correct definition of this phrase.\n1. Therefore, we can deduce that 'poor' relates to insufficient quality.\n2. Looking at Choices, we know that a weak paper does not meet the correct standard of academic writing. It would be weak for lacking information, or for not being deep enough, but it is likely that you'd be graded on paper quality more for its lack of detail (in terms of quality, rather than quantity), or depth rather than for its rich qualities or density.\n3. Choices B, C and D therefore must be eliminated.\n4. A weak paper is not strong or thick with information, and therefore it is likely not 'understated', 'rich' or 'dense' in quality.\n5. These qualities can describe a strong paper.\n6. Therefore,'sparse, shallow, lacking depth' is the best possible answer choice for this description.\n7. Hence, the answer is Choice E.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: There once was a man who was famous for his wit, he was a raconteur extraordinaire. Choices:  D. The raconteur was a great storyteller. C.

{"text": "fly', is wordy and doesn't fit the context.\n5. Choices C and D both relate to psychological issues surrounding performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, can potentially cause someone to have butterflies in their stomach or make them feel uneasy, causing them to avoid performing. While this might happen to a person who loves performing, it seems more likely to occur to one who doesn't. \n7. Choice C, Anxiety, has many different meanings depending on the context in which it is used, including a psychological condition that causes severe worry and fear. Hence, is most likely. \n8. Therefore, it is most likely the answer will be C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Output\nInput: What is the most likely to happen after an alcoholic's speech? Choices: regrets, accidents, driving drunk, or nonsense. \nRationales:\n1. The question is focused on what happens to the speech of an alcoholic after they become inebriae, so it's clear that any mention of consequences is disregarded as the focus is on the speech itself. The question asks what is most likely to happen to the speech of an inebriated person, given that both choices A and B are related to communication, we look at options.\n2. Choice E, accidents doesn't make sense because this isn't directly related to the speech. There are other potential outcomes (choice F is the most likely answer) such as the speech not being well-received or the alcoholic feeling self-conscious or embarrassed by their speech, but these are far less likely.\n3. Choices D and E, accidents and talk nonses, respectively aren't likely either because they aren't related to the inebriae state specifically.\n4. Choices C and F are most likely because they are related to being drunk, which is directly related to the \"inebriae\" state, and are mentioned specifically later on in the question.\n5. Therefore, it is likely that choice F, talk nonsense, will occur.\nAnswer: F: talk nonsense", "answer": " 69"}
{"text": "fly', is not a plausible answer as it is a statement relating to talent-person relations. It does not answer the question directly.\n5. Choices C and D can be combined to form C', 'anxiety or happiness'. \n6. However, we know the person has a certain talent, which is not relatable to either happiness or anxiety. \n7. In contrast, choice E, 'energetic', means having a great amount of energy. \n8. Having a talent can cause one to become energized regarding the activity or subject in question, creating the opposite of inhibition, suggesting E can be eliminated. \n9. Therefore, option A' is more likely the most accurate answer as it describes the person has an injury, whereas the other options do not. \n10. Therefore, the final answer is A': injury.\nAnswer: A': injury\n\nInput: If you don't want to be hit by a pitch, what should you do? Choices: 1 B: get runners advance 2 B: call a strike 3 B: avoid the pitcher 4 B: avoid the catcher\nRationales:\n1. The question is saying that a person doesn't want to be \"hit by a pitch\", as in a ball thrown at their person by the pitcher.\n2. Avoid the pitcher - A person should avoid the person throwing the ball, which is the pitcher. \n3. Avoid the catcher -A person should avoid the person catching the ball - the catcher. \n4. Avoid the pitch - A person should avoid getting hit by the ball thrown by the pitcher. The answer is C\n\nInput: What are the characteristics of a good book?

{"text": "fly', doesn't refer to physical ailments but mentions general discomfort about performing. \n5. While people do suffer from anxiety when they are performing, that's not the question, so we can eliminate choice C. \n6. Choices B and C do not refer to physical pain, so we can eliminate option D as a possibility due to not matching conditions of the sentence as described in step 2. \n7. Looking at remaining choices, option E implies a sense of happiness, so we can eliminate that. \n8. Therefore, it becomes apparent that the most plausible choice is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: What did the dog do to make the teacher angry? Choices:  a. wag b. bark c. beg d. eat e. sleep\nRationales: Choice A, 'wag', does not imply the teacher's anger. Instead, it implies the dog's general behavior. \"Whatever you do, don't tap those bones or the dog will want to wag it.\" While this could mean \"it will wag its tail\" or \"it will wag itself in excitement,\" it doesn't imply that tapping the bones made the dog's tail wag as one would typically do with a bone to cause the dog to wag its tail.\nChoice B, 'bark,' may indicate the dog was barking but does not imply the teacher was angry. \"I thought it was funny how the dog kept barking until everything was gone and then sat down with the bone.\" Although this may imply the dog was bark-happy, it does not suggest the dog made the teacher angry by barking.\nChoice C, 'beg,' is not anger-inducing but rather an act of requesting from the teacher. \"If you aren't going to give me anything to eat, I'm going to beg.\" While 'begging' may make a person angry, in this case, it was the dog begging.\nChoice D, 'eat,' may be an indication of the dog being hungry but that alone does not make a person angry. \"I wonder what made that dog so hungry, I wonder if it got into the garbage or ate some breadcrumbs.\"\nChoice E,'sleep,' indicates the dog having gone to sleep, not", "answer": " 328"}
{"text": "flies', could be a possible answer but does not fit the context of what's being asked. Butterflies are a metaphor commonly used to signify emotional turmoil. \n5. Choice D, happiness, could be a plausible answer as someone who is happy performs better than someone who isn't. However, it's not a definitive response.\n6. Also, choice E, 'energetic', is a positive descriptor but could be confused with other answers since 'energetic' can also describe a positive feeling or a strong performance. \n7. This leaves us with Choice C, 'anxiety', because it is the only answer that fits the context, with anxiety being an emotional issue rather than physical or physical.\n8. Therefore the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: What does the term \"kiss cam\" refer to? Choices:  C: kissing D: cam E: cheering F: kisses\nRationales: Given that the term \"kisscam\" refers to a device that shows couples kissing, the question must be asking what a kisscam is, which is a device.\n5. Since a kisscam is a device, option D, referring to \"kisscam\" must specifically be about kiss cameras.\n6. This leaves us with the following choices - camera, kiss and camera.\n7. \"Camera\" and \"kiss\" do not make sense.\n8.\"Camera\" refers only to the mechanical device which is different from what the term refers to overall. Therefore, we can eliminate \"camera\"\n9. The same goes for \"camera\" as this is referring to the term \"kisscamera\" and cannot be applied.\n10. Since \"camera\", \"kiss\" and \"camera\" are eliminated, we are left with choice F, 'the kissing game.' A kisscam is not a kissing game, so this is the best answer to the question.\nAnswer: F. The kissing game.\n\nInput: I think my parents are using what on me, the thought makes me a bit aggreived.

Therefore the best answer is option C, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: If a person wants to study a specific topic or skill, what can they do by themself? Choices: 1) A: read a book\nChoices: 2) B: take a class/course\nChoices: 3) C: find a tutor\nChoices: 4) E: learn on the internet\nChoices: 5) D: ask other people\nRationales: Options B, C, D and E could be used to describe different ways to learn; reading a book, taking a class/course, finding a tutor and learning on the internet are all different ways to learn a particular skill. But, looking at choice A, it says that if a person wants to study this, they need to read a book, which is different than the other options because a person could read a book, take a class/course, find a tutor or learn on the internet, but this is telling the person to read a book only.\nAnswer: Choice: B, Options A: read a book, C: find a tute and E: learn on the intern can give information but the person can choose B: Options B: take a class/.course to learn this skill.\n\n**C:\\Users\\USER\\Documents\\workbooks\\English\\Reading\\test102e.pdf (32)**\n\n[1]: https://github.com/gumdav/gumdav.github.io/blob/master/_posts/index.html\n[2]: https://github.org/gumdav\n[3]: https://github.github.io/\n\n**C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jdk-1.8.0_261\\jre\\lib\\deploy.jar (1073)**", "answer": " 850,000"}

How likely is it that a student's strategy is correct? Choices:  B: always wrong C: likely to be correct D: often wrong E: maybe wrong\nRationales:1. The question asks how likely it is for a student's strategy to find a correct answer in a math competition.\n2. Considering the answer choices, a student's strategy would only lead to a wrong answer if the correct answer is not what the student has picked. \n3. If the answer the student has picked is actually the correct answer, then the student's strategy is a method.\n4. A method will always lead to a correct answer.\n5. Therefore, it is always likely for a student's methods to find correct answers in a math competition. The best answer would be Choice A: always correct.\n6. However, it's often the case that methods give wrong answers.\n7. Therefore the answer may be C: likely wrong. \n8.

Now, as it's clear that this question is about the physical limitations of performance, consideration is given to Choices D and B, 'happiness' and 'butterflies'. \n7. Both happiness and butterflies are related to mental or psychological states/feelings, meaning this person is suffering from a psychological reservation. \n8.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense either, as these are two unrelated topics. \n5. Choice E, energy, also doesn't make sense as being energetic is a positive trait, not something that describes someone who is reluctant to perform. \n6. This leaves us with choices B and D.  \n7. The only choice that makes sense is choice D, 'anxiety'.\n8. Anxiety is the feeling of unease or tension, often relating to social situations, which is closely related to performing. An actor who is reluctant because they have social anxiety may struggle to perform. \n9. Choice D states'suffer from' which means 'deal with'. The actor has anxiety but continues to perform, showing they can deal with it. \n10. Hence, the answer is D.\nAnswer: D.

A: making icing\nB: mixing wet ingredients in a bowl\nC: decorating\nD: separating\nE: weighing\nRationales: The question asks what task could be accomplished using cookies and baking, implying that a baker has been tasked with making large amounts of these items.\n1. The question provides specific details about the process of making cookies, including the task of mixing wet ingredients.\n2. Choice A is a task that can be achieved by using a cookie.\n3. Choices B and C both involve a cookie in the process of being decorated or separated\n4. Choice D describes the process of \"weighing\" which could not involve using cookies.\n5. Choices A and B relate to \"making icing\", which involves a cookie\n6. Choice D may be related to \"icing\" or \"decorating\" - but as you can see it is not the main point of interest - the word \"cookie\" in the question is the essential term we are looking for - the word \"icing\" is essentially a byproduct of the task given to the baker\n7.

{"text": "flys', is a repetitive phrase that contains nothing that logically pertains to the question at hand. \n5. Choice D, happiness, makes no sense for the question, as performing wouldn't bring happiness unless the performance itself is what the person is suffering from.\n6. Looking again, choice E is irrelevant because the person enjoys performing and is happy about it. \n7. As we have narrowed down the answer, we can make educated guesses about their potential diagnosis: \n8. In general, people don't voluntarily avoid activities they enjoy doing, unless there are some external barriers stopping them. \n9. Therefore, it makes sense to assume that psychologically, the person suffers from anxiety. It is possible that the person could suffer from happiness, but as the choice to avoid performing brings no sense, the chances that the person could be \"energetic\" are reduced.\n10. As Choice E, energetic' is ruled out, the next most likely answer would be Choice C, anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: You like to eat foods that are nutritious.

As the question is solely asking for the descriptor for someone who takes a course, the option F. A teacher or an educator does not make sense as it refers to a person who gives out knowledge instead of someone who receives it.\n  * A and B are out of the question as learning and a student are both describing someone who is studying and not someone who is taking a course.\n4. Since it's not learning, nor a student, nor attentive, nor an attendee, nor intelligent, the answer is D, as an attendee is one who attends something, such as a meeting or class.\nAnswer: D. an attene\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following history question.\n\n## Task:\n\n### Demostration:\n#### Input:The following results were obtained in a recent experiment.\n\n```javascript\n1: 100", "answer": " 3"}

Choice D, happiness, is not possible either as it is not an aptitude but it is irrelevant to the situation from the question (a talent cannot necessarily cause happiness to the person with it). \n6. Choice C, anxiety does not seem fitting either as it is a psychological and physical reaction to stress.\n7. That leaves us with Choice E, 'energetic'.\n8. This choice implies a mental or physical fatigue and may explain why the person with talent is hesitant to perform.\n9. Therefore the answer is A: injury.\nAnswer: A :injury\n\nInput: What would be likely to come to people as a result of not maintaining their teeth or gums? Choices:  * A: bad breath B: loss of taste C: cavities * D: gum eruptions E: abscesses\nRationales: * 1. The question provides a scenario with an expected outcome.\n2. Given how the scenario is set up, it seems reasonable to choose choices that align with or make sense in relation to those expectations.\n3. With Choice D, \"Gum eruptions\", it doesn't indicate any significant change/problem pertaining to taste.\n4. So, we can eliminate that choice.\n5. Similarly, with Choice E, \"abscesses\", it does not indicate a change in taste or in the mouth.\n6. Thus, we can eliminate those choices too.\n7. Since a cavity doesn't have to affect the taste, either, Choices A, B, and C are options that don't really fit.\n8. So, to select the most reasonable choice, we will base our choice on the outcome's logic.\n9. With Choice A \"bad breath\", it would make sense that if a person is regularly visiting the dentist then their breath would not stink or smell bad.\n10. Therefore, that seems to be the most fitting choice.\nAnswer: * A: bad breath\n\nInput: Choose a word that has an opposite in meaning to the given, and a sentence that includes both words, which", "answer": " 14"}
{"text": "fly', does not make sense as 'butterflies' is a metaphor for anxiety that is not related to performing and performance talent.  \n5. Hence, we can immediately eliminate choice B. \n6.

Choice C, Anxiety, has been eliminated, leaving Choices from A to D. \n8. Choice E, happiness, is not relevant to the question as the word 'happiness' is not used or referred to in the question or any of the answers. \n9. Hence, Choices from A to C remain.  \n10. Since choice A, 'injuries' was previously eliminated, Choice B, anxiety, is a possibility, as it is relevant and fitting.  \n11. However, choice B has already been eliminated, which points towards the only remaining choice being C, anxiety. \n12. Hence, the answer is Choice C, anxieties. \nAnswer: B: Anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following words rhyme with'shadows'? Choices: 1: C: D: F: 2: B: D: 3: B: H: C: E: E: G: 4: B: D: G: E: G: F:\nRationales: Looking at choices that rhyme with'shadow', a good choice would be 'bats', as it's a very obvious guess. A less obvious guess would 'dogs.' Other good guesses would be 'pigeons' or 'furnace'. Choice A is a noun, whereas the other choices are adjectives. Choice B is incorrect because it is not a real word, unlike the other answers. Choices E & G also both have multiple words that rhyme with'shadow'. Choice A or C would also be acceptable answers, as they are adjectives that rhyme with 'bats'.\nAnswer: H: 'dogs'\n\nInput: What was the most surprising fact about the 2013 state of the world?

Choice D, \"happiness\", could potentially refer to the notion of feeling good about an event, but it doesn't directly address whether someone is happy or not. \n6. However, choice E (\"energetic\") could work, as \"energetic\" refers to an individual who is lively enough to enjoy a performance art, indicating reluctance to perform is likely related to anxiety or a lack of confidence.\n7. By eliminating all other choices, it is rational to choose option E, \"energetic\", as it's the only remaining plausible option that matches the context given.\nAnswer: E energy\n\nInput: If a dog walks it's owner, what's likely to give itself bark? Choices: \nA: a bad leg B: the leg C: the dog\nD: a tree E: a flower\n\nRationales:\n1. The dog is walking its owner. We can determine with some confidence (because we have a question asking about a dog rather than an owner) that the dog is the subject doing the walking.\n2. The subject \u2013 dog, is capable of giving. It could give an owner a bad/leg, its leg, itself, a flower or a tree. The subject in the sentence is the dog, not the owner.\n3. The dog is the subject of the sentence, and as a subject, it has the ability to give. All the other choices would be impossible things for the dog to do.\n4. Thus, as a subject capable capable of giving, the best answer is B, to give - its leg. \n5. This is the only choice that fits the context and the subject of the sentence. \n\nComment: I don't know.

{"text": "fly's', is incorrect as we are asked about a person's anxiety and happiness, not physical constraints related to injuries or butterflies. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", isn't the right option as someone can feel anxious and happy without suffering from injury. \n6. Choice B, \"anxiety\", is the right option. \n7. Thus, it makes sense that the person in question must have anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxious\n\nInput: How is life? Choices:  B: dull C: happy D: wonderful E: exciting\nRationales:\n1. The question posed is \"how is life?\".\n2. In order to determine the correct response, we need to determine how life itself can be in general, given this question.\n3. Based on the options, we can discard Choice D \"wonderful\" as it is a feeling which may reflect how life feels to an individual person, not life in general.\n4. Similarly, Choice E \"exciting\" can be discarded, as this is an emotion that reflects how something or someone might affect an individual, not how life itself may feel.\n5. Choices C \"dull\" and B \"life is dull\" are discarded as life itself cannot be \"dull\" - this would imply an individual's feelings are dull about something.\n6.

{"text": "fly', is correct but does not pertain specifically to someone who is talent but doesn' but enjoy performing. \n5. Choice D, is 'happiness' is an emotion, not an inherent character trait, so it makes little sense in this context.\n6. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energetic', respectively, are relevant character traits that are similar to a performer. Each individual performer is unique, so while these may be applicable to some, there is no reason to assume they would apply to everyone.\n7. Looking back on the question, we know that \"If someone is talented, but doesn't like doing it, they are probably anxious.\" \n8. Thus looking at the choices again, we deduce that Choice D.

{"text": "fers', is also not correct, as butterflies do not have anything to do with whether the subject likes performing. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not a sufficient reason to shy away from performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is more likely to discourage the person from performing, as anxiety usually creates an emotional aversion to situations.\n7. Consider choice E: energetic, which refers to a lively, energetic personality. However, energetic people like performing and so would not likely suffer this aversion. \n8. Therefore, by looking at all the reasonable choices, the best answer is Choice C, anxieties.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: A company or group that does outreach services such as community service is commonly called a?\nChoices:  A: team B: community C: volunteer D: agency E: group\nRationales: To answer this question, we first need to understand what \"outreach\", \"servicing\" and \"community\" mean, as it is unclear from the information given whether the question involves general volunteer work or a type of specific activity. \n1. Looking at Choice A, \"team\", this refers to team play and would not be applicable in either situation. \n2. Choice B, \"community\" usually refers to neighborhoods or the general society. Therefore, it would not be applicable to a service that includes the community, as this makes no sense. \n3. Similarly, Choice D, \"agency\", refers to an intermediary that organizes things for other people, typically in a business sense.\n4. Choices C and E, \"volunteer\" and \"group\", are applicable, as a volunteer can provide service and a group can serve the community. \n5. Then, considering what is meant by a team or group doing \"outreach\" or \"servicing\" - namely, performing services within the community. This makes Choice C the best one, as it defines the team and its services clearly. \n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is Choice C, \"group\".\nAnswer: C: group\n\nInput: You have been asked to take on more duty at work, but do not want to, what should you do?

{"text": "fly's', is incorrect on multiple levels. Firstly, talent persons can suffer from injury. Secondly, 'butterflies' is not an emotion, and it makes no sense to say 'talent persons cannot feel butterflies'.\n5. Choice D, while making sense on the first reading, still isn't correct. Happiness can be related to enjoyment or performance but is too general to describe someone who isn't enjoying a particular performance.\n6. Choices B and D, thus, need to be eliminated. \n7. Choice C, anxiety, on the other hand, is the right choice here. Even when talent persons have anxiety, they can still perform. They may not enjoy the performance, but they have the ability to perform regardless. \n8. Choice E, as it makes no sense to speak about a 'energetic' person, is eliminated along with choice C. \n9. Therefore, answer D is chosen as it makes the most sense to explain the character's conflict.\nAnswer: D E: energetic", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "flys', refers to a situation in which talent persons cannot face potential injury or stage fright. \n5. Choice B could apply in some circumstances, but as it doesn't specify whether this applies to only those who enjoy performing, or anyone who suffers from stage fright, it's too vague to be a correct answer.\n6. Choices C and D are not directly about suffering; they focus more on feeling happy, or energetic, respectively. \n7. Choices B and D could be related, but it's more important to consider what is stated in the question.\n8. Therefore we can eliminate choice D, 'happiness'. Further we can eliminate choice E's, 'energetic' because it doesn't make sense given the context of the question.\n9. What then remains are two options that deal with a psychological reservation; choice B, 'anxiety', and choice C, 'anxiety'. \n10. While anxiety is a psychological disorder, it doesn't fit as it is not directly related to the issue the question is trying to determine.\n11. Therefore we can conclude that the best answer is choice C, 'an anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: After years of effort, the young woman finally made what?

We can start by reviewing our potential answers to see which best represents the essence of the phrase \"after years of effort\", without having the connotation of being either \"an omelet\" or \"a dish\".\n2. Considering choices B and E, an omelet and a cake, they are both food dishes, but neither expresses something that requires years of effort.\n3. Choices A (\"an omelet\"), and D (\"a pie\"), can refer to food, but they are too vague because, in the context of this sentence, it can take years for the person to make a food omelet or a pie, as the time frame is not clearly defined and is not required for an omelet or a piece of cake.\n4.", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "fly', refers to the butterflies some people get before a show. This is not referring to a physical or psychological issue.\n5. Choices C and D,'stress/anxiety' and 'happiness/excitation', focus too much on whether the person is positive or negative about performing. The question doesn't specifically ask about the person's opinion, but rather about the fact that they might suffer from some kind of issue related to performing.\n6. Option E, 'energetic', refers to a state of high energy or vitality. This does not make sense as the word 'energetic' is not related to performing and talent, and does not refer to any negative or positive aspect of a person. \n7. Therefore, by elimination, \"energetic\" doesn't make as sense as the answer.\n8. This leaves us with \"Anxiety\" and \"Happiness\". \n9. \"Happiness\" isn't an issue \u2013 someone can have a talent and still be content with their performance. \n10. Therefore, the correct answer is \"Anxiety\" because a person can still have talents even if they are anxious about performing.\nAnswer: C:\"Anxiety\"\n\nInput: One of the best places to buy food wholesale is at a?

Choice D, \"wholesaler,\" is a specialized grocer that specializes in selling large volumes of one product at a time. 6. So D is the best choice here because B is a general term, groceries stores in general, groceries store and E and C both refer to specific types, groceries store. 7.

{"text": "fly', suggests people with talent shouldn't suffer if not expressing it. This doesn't make sense, as there needs to be a reason for the person to restrain from performing in the first place. \n5. Choice D, while related to an emotion, could still potentially exist in spite of performing. \n6. Choice C, the choice we are left with, has a more logical reason behind why a 'talent but doesn't like' person would also suffer from anxiety.\n7.

Choices:  P: water B: air C: oxygen D: sunlight E: soil\nRationales: This question is asking what a frog would need if it had no access to food, so let's review each choice below.\n1. Choice A, P: water, is correct; water is a necessity for any living creature.\n2. Choice B, air, falls out because oxygen is a crucial component of air, which the frog would no longer consume without food.\n3. Choices C and D, Oxygen and sunlight, respectively, are also inappropriate because they would be the same as having no food. In fact, they both rely on food for their existence. \n4. Therefore, the best choice is E, which accurately describes how a frog would need to ingest food to survive.\nAnswer: E, soil.\n\nInput: Which body of water has the purest water?

{"text": "fly-induced anxiety', also does not make sense as these are two separate problems; being injury-free and experiencing butterflies do not logically require one another. \n5.

Choice D, \u2018Happiness\u2019 seems like a potential possibility, but this is not a psychological state; it is a subjective emotion, so it is not related to anxiety about performing.\n7. Leaving us with choices C and D. Choice C, \u2018Anxiety\u2019 has some plausibility, but this question is asking about reasons why someone might not perform. Anxiety does not seem to be a good reason for not performing.\n8.

What are they doing in our sky? Choices: 1. A: they are very close B: they stay very far away C: they move close to the ground when it's night D: they move fast E: they are close to the Earth\nRationales: After the initial question, the question presents two seemingly obvious possibilities: 1. Stars move far away (D) or 2. Stars are close (E). This narrows the possible answer to either D or E. Then, the possibility of B is eliminated by the phrase 'they are very far away.' Additionally, we know that stars don't move toward anything (E, choice 3), specifically, the ground. This eliminates option 4: they move fast. This leaves the remaining answer choices as B or C. We know that the correct answer is D, what are they doing? They are moving away from us. \nAnswer: D: they are moving away from us\n\nInput: I went to visit my old teacher in Florida.

{"text": "fliex', is gramatically incorrect; it should probably say either 'can' or 'can't'. Also, though technically not incorrect, there is no need for 'injury and butterflies'. Butterflies can not affect people's talents\n5. Choice D, happiness, is not a cause of anxiety, so it shouldn't be included. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, doesn't seem to make sense as a cause but rather an effect; anxiety can be a result of having to perform in front of others but it can't cause someone to not enjoy their talent. Thus, it should probably be included.\n7. Choices E, talent can bring energy, but it can not bring an overflow of energy, thus, this doesn't fit well either.\n8.

Choices:  A. A hurry B. Patience C. Relaxed D. Hurried E. Carefree\nRationales:\n1. The person in the question is driving down a two-way street in either a hurry or carefree.\n2. The choice \"a hurry\" makes sense, since people tend to speed up and pay less attention to other road users if they are in a hurry.\n3. \"Patience\" is not about being in a rush or not rushing at all, so we can eliminate this from consideration.\n4. The word \"hurry\" is a verb. \"Hurried\" describes one who is experiencing being in a hurry, and \"hurried\" is not possible while driving. Therefore, we can eliminate \"hurried\" as well.\n5. \"Relaxed\" and \"carefree\" describe people who are typically not in a hurry, but rather not in a panic. However, if one is in a hurry and then becomes relaxed or carefree, it might not be a good idea.\n6. Since \"carefree\" does not describe people who are in a hurry, this choice also should be considered invalid.\n7. We are left with \"D, Hur", "answer": " 21"}

Choice C, \"anxiety,\" also seems plausible given that anxiety is a psychological concern, but \"anxiety\" is a condition, not a particular state of mind, so it would be more accurate for this context to describe the specificity of the feeling.\n11. Choice D, happiness is closer to the implied intent of the question. \n12. Since these two choices are closest to the question, it's useful to combine them by using 'anxiety about performing'.\n13. We now have a specific state of mind that applies to someone who possesses talent but does not like to perform.\n14. Hence, the answer is D and E.\nAnswer: D and E: anxiety about performing\n\nInput: On the way through his math class, Alex started to get a splitting headache. How do you think the teacher would respond? Choices: \nA: with a big smile B: by giving him a break C: with concern D: by laughing\nRationales:  1. The question is trying to infer how the teacher would respond if a student arrives to class with a splitting headache. \n2. Considering the given context, the student is doing math - not playing a sport - so we can rule out any options related to physical activity. \n3. It is more reasonable to assume that the math teacher, as a professional educator, would respond seriously and in a respectful manner. \n4. The other choices, 'giving him a break' and 'with a concern', sound more suitable for a sports coach or a doctor,", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense as a complete sentence and also doesn't describe the character's predicament.\n5. Choices D and E are not relevant as they do not refer to an emotional state or psychological issue. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", makes sense as an answer because it refers to a common and typical psychological barrier to performing: anxiety. \n7. Therefore, answer C: anxiety is most accurate.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: Everyone needs to eat well to have optimal health, what should we eat? Choices: 1 A: jalapeno B: lettuce C: spinach D: carrots E: none of the above\n\nRationales: The question wants a response that describes a food item that should be included in a healthy diet.\nOption A: The jalapeno is a pepper that is spicy and hot in taste. For this reason, it is not considered to be a good food item to add to a regular diet because it could be too intense, both in terms of taste and heat.\nOption B: Lettuce is a green leafy vegetable that is considered to be a healthy food item to add to the regular diet, notably for its dietary fiber and nutrient value.\nOption C: Green spinach is a leafy green vegetable that is considered somewhat healthier than lettuce. When considering adding spinach to the regular diet is a good idea for several reasons. One of these reasons is its nutrient content, including dietary fiber, which is known to help regulate digestive health.\nOption D: Carrots are a root vegetable that has a sweet taste to it. They are good for overall nutrition and eating them can help reduce risk of chronic conditions such as heart disease and strokes.\nOption E: None of the above are food items that should be added to the regular diet for added nutritional purposes. None of these options are healthy additions for overall dietary nutritional benefit.\nAnswer: Option D, Carrots, is the answer that fits the best.\n\nInput: What has a higher risk of infidelity, marriage or monogamous relationships?

{"text": "lies', doesn't make sense \u2013 it's not a statement, and is rather contradictory, considering butterflies are a common symptom of anxiety. \n5. Choices 'C', 'D', and 'E' are all related to the opposite of what the question is asking \u2013 people that enjoy performing. \n6. This gives us one choice remaining: C. \n7. Considering that anxiety is related to an emotional reaction, it is reasonable to assume that people who don't like performing may be experiencing this.\n8. Therefore the best answer is C. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A group of people will be leaving at 4pm. What time will the first person leave? Choices: 1. 3:20 B. 3:21 C. 3:46 D. 4:42 E. 5:02 F. 5:00\nRationales: In this question, it's required to calculate the time the first person would leave if a group of people departed at 4pm. \nLets analyze the options:\n\nA. This answer does NOT make sense, as it's more than 20 minutes ahead of 4pm. 4pm plus a half an hour comes out to be 4:30pm\nB. This answer is NOT relevant. It's clearly NOT the first person. 3:22 would be the second person.\nC. This answer does not make sense. Considering a group of people leaves at 4pm, we know it won't be an individual or two people. We're looking for a time when people start leaving, not when everyone leaves.\nD. This answer makes no sense. According to this answer, the first person leaves 26 minutes after everyone else, which is more than 25% (or 20 minutes, since 24% of 4 hours is 20 minutes) before they are supposed to leave.\nE. This answer does not seem to make sense. According to this option, the first person leaves around 26 minutes, which is roughly 25% of 1 hour - which is not close to the time they are supposed to leave (4pm).\nF. The final answer is F, 4pm", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "fly', says that talented people can't suffer injury \u2013 so it is not a choice. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is too specific to the positive side of the spectrum and may be a result of their talent, rather than the basis for lacking will-power with performance. \n6. Choice C, \"Anxiety\" doesn't exactly meet the criterion of not enjoying performance either. \n7. Answer E: \"energetic\", has many different meanings other than performing well in a show. \n8. We can thus, determine if someone is great at something but does not like performing, there is a chance they suffer from anxiousness.\n9. Hence, D: anxiousness is the most appropriate choice.\nAnswer: A, B, C, & E are wrong, D: anxiousness\n\nInput: How is the person described by option A, B, C like the individual described by statement D? Choices:  E: very different F: like G: alike H: the same\nRationales:\n1. The character that is described by \"A\" is one who goes on numerous adventures and is brave. The one described by F goes on a lot of adventures and is brave, so this answer choice makes sense.\n2. The person described by the option is one who is full of humor and laughter. But this is also an attribute of the person described by B option. So, this option does not make sense.\n3. The character that is given in the sentence is not afraid to take risks. This is true for the given options as well. However, G does not use the verb \"take\" explicitly; it is implied.\n4. The person described by E option does not like to take risks. So, this option makes no sense.\n5. The person described by C does not like adventures. Hence, this option is wrong.\n6. The person described by D is one who is a little bit naughtier. So, the option that makes sense will be the same as it.\n7. Therefore the correct option is C: \"The person described by D is the same as the person described by \noption C because they both do not like adventures\".\nAnswer: C: That person is the same as the other person\n\nInput: The scientist is in his lab, working on a", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "fly', is not a valid choice because the first part of the sentence says that the person has a talent (and hence is not a talent person). \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not make sense, as it's not a typical negative expectation about performing. \n6. Choice C, Anxiety is a potential negative expectation. \n7. Considering the rest of the sentence, 'but energetic', doesn't seem like a plausible option. \n8. The sentence structure of choice E, 'but energetics', sounds similar to choice 6, suggesting this could be a correct answer. \n9. However, taking a look at each individual word, it seems to imply a performance filled with energy and enthusiasm. \n10. It's more likely that this negatively influences someone who does not like performing in the first place, thus, reducing the energy. \n11. As a result, it's unlikely that the person is overly energetic while performing, but this does not describe a potential negative expectation towards performing.\n12. So, we can remove the rest of the word 'energetics' to make choice C more relevant to the question. \n13. So, to summarize, the correct answer is C: Anxiety\nAnswer: C: Anxiety", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "fly', is not a complete statement but rather, only a sentence fragment, meaning that it is improperly prepared.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', are not directly related to the performance arts which the question implies the person can enjoy or perform.\n6. Choices 'injury' and 'butterflies' may not make sense in this context.\n7. As a result, the answer that makes the most sense would fall back to Choice E, 'energetic', which suggests the person would have passionate energy, allowing the person to perform enthusiastically.\nAnswer: E. energetic\n\nInput: She is having difficulty concentrating. I think the teacher shouldn't give her homework for class. Why? Choices:  She might not be able to finish her work. He might not be able to concentrate on class. She might feel confused. They are more likely to talk to a teacher. They might not know the material\nRationales:  1. Her difficulty concentrating was identified in the sentence. \n2. The teacher's decision rests on her inability to study for class.\n3. Looking to the choices, it seems unlikely that \"they are more likely to talk with the teacher\". Given we're making a decision based on their state of mind, it must be a negative decision.\n4. It is clear that the student is unable to study at home, but it is unclear if she \"might not know the material\". \n5. The student isn't able to study at home for the material, but it's unclear if she knows the material, which does make sense to assign homework. \n6. It may seem that the teacher should assign homework to the student only because she \"is more likely to talk to the teacher\" and \"she might not know the material\". However, this is a faulty logic as she shouldn't have homework if she doesn't know the material. \n7. Given that, the best answer is \"She might not know the material\", as if her attention to studies at home is necessary, she must be studying the material she is unable to study for her class. \n8. The most reasonable implication would be that she has not studied the material at all and might not understand it.\nAnswer: D. She might not know the material.", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "fliess ', is incorrect because having a talent does not mean you cannot suffer from injury or butterflies, the phrasing is incorrect. \n5.

{"text": "flys.' does not make sense as what is meant by 'butterflies' - it may be a misspelling of 'butterflies'. \n5. Choice E, which says, \"a person who is energetic, may not like performing\", doesn't make sense as not liking performing and being energetic do not go together, nor does energy have anything to do with performing. \n6. Option C is possibly correct, as performing can be mentally demanding and cause anxiety. Still, it isn't the most direct answer and there is a more direct and succinct answer to the sentence.  \n7. This suggests option D is the correct answer. \n8. Option D, 'anxiety', is the correct answer, as it is an accurate fit and is closely related to an individual's reluctance to perform. \n\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: Choose your favorite color between these options.\n\n### Example 1:\n\nYou are in a dilemma.

{"text": "fly', does not make sense as 'talent persons' in general shouldn't suffer from either an injury or butterflies in the stomach, and they probably shouldn't have any butterflies when it comes to actually performing.\n5.

Choices: 1. melody 2. lyrics 3. notes 4. rhythm\nRationales: This question is asking which of the given answers is common between all tunes that people can sing in the shower. A tune includes all the characteristics listed in the question, meaning there is only one possible answer. Any other choice would be either incorrect or would simply be a description of a tune in general. Choice A: \"Melody\" is a type of music that can include the other 3 characteristics. However, it is not a specific characteristic of songs sung in the shower. Choice B: \"Lyrics\" is a type of poetry that can be included in various tunes, including many songs that people sing in the shower, but lyrics in general aren't a common or unique feature of tunes sung in the showers. Choice C: \"Notes\" are a characteristic of music, and can contribute to musical tunes, but it has no connection to the shower. Choose D: \"Rhythm\" is another characteristic of music, and many tunes could include it, but not all songs/tunes that people sing in the tub would have a rhythm. That way, you can conclude that the only choice that matches the wording of the prompt is Answer E, which describes all tunes as having the same 3 characteristics.\nAnswer: E. All. Tunes are similar because they generally have three of the characteristics in the prompt.\n\nInput: Which of the following should you avoid while performing oral surgery?

This question requires understanding what a herd, pride, flock, flower and patch are so that we can determine what might be the most appropriate answer.\n2. Let' s consider the definitions:\n6. H: A group of cows is called a herd. \n7. P: A group of lions is called a pride. \n8. F: A group of geese is called a flock. \n9. Flower: A group of peacock feathers is called a flower.\n\n10. With this definition in mind, we know that the options include the terms Flock (geese), Herb (cows), Flower (peacock feathers), and Pride (Lions). \n\n11.

Considering Choices A and E, both options involve appreciating the scenery, however, Option E, 'Enjoy the scenery', may imply that we should take the scenery into consideration when we have the ability to do so.

{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense either as 'talent' is in regards to their natural skill and 'butterflies' is a metaphor for anxiety which is likely something an untalented person would experience. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is potentially relevant, however, it may not be specifically due to not performing as happiness could be a reaction to other circumstances. \n6. Choice C, worry, is less likely as it can be caused by a wide range of things, not just the choice they made to shy away from performing.\n7. Therefore we can confidently answer that Choice E, anxiety, is likely the closest answer.\n8. However, the question may be asking if a person with talent, but who does not like performing, suffers from 'talent' or 'performing?' \n9. In this case, Choice E, 'anxiety', would be a good choice.\nAnswer: E : anxiety or enjoy performance\n\nInput: What does it mean for a company to be profitable but not successful? Choices: \nA: making a profit but getting minimal customers B: making little money C: making a lot of money D: making a lot of profit E: not making a profit\nRationales:\n1. The question's text implies a company can be profitable but not be successful if it did not maximize its opportunities.\n2. Compare Answer choices A, B, and C with the meaning of the text.\n3. Answer choice A, \"making a profit but getting minimal users\" does not seem like a good way to describe a company that is not successful.\n4. Choices B, C, and D also do not seem to capture the essential meaning.\n5. Choices A and B are both unacceptable, as they imply maximizing a company's sales (profit) is essential to a company's success.\n6.

Choices: \n A: The friend was not a friend B: The friend was very happy to see the dog. C: The friend was wearing a sweater which the dog did not like. D: The friend was surprised to see the dog. E: The friend was asleep and woke up.\nRationales:1. The choice C: \"The friend was wearing a beater which the dog did like.\" could be easily removed from contention because the dog, knowing who it was barking at, was likely to like the sweater the friend was wearing. \n2. The choice D: \"The friend was surprised to see him,\" also could be eliminated as likely not the cause of the barking because the surprised friend might not have liked that the dog was there in the first place, and, as a result, might not have been happy to see it. \n3. This then leaves the answers A and B: \"The friend was not a friend,\" and \"The friend was happy to see the dog.\" \n4. This means that the dog had walked into the room where an old friend had been sitting. And it barked because it was happy to see this friend. \n5. The dog did not start barking because the friend was a friend in the first place. Thus the choice A: \"The friend was a friend\" is the answer we seek.\nAnswer: A.

Choices B and C, together, contain a phrase that suggests an instance of 'happiness' can be experienced by these types of people, so we can eliminate those choices as well.\n6. Choices E and F, 'energy' and 'happiness', respectively, relate to positive emotional states. They could not be suffered from in this context.\n7. Thus, the remaining choices are A, D, and E. \n8. While 'anxiety' can be suffered by this person, the question does not emphasize the presence of \"anxiety\", causing hesitation within the sentence.\n9.

The money could be used to pay for someone else's school - even the person's own, so the gala itself isn't the main reason for the attendee to attend.\n2. This suggests that a reason for someone to attend is either to have fun, celebrate, or maintain a tradition.\n3. The options provided to us are A, B, C, D, and E, respectively. A, B, and D relate to the gala itself, not the purpose of the gala, so we can eliminate them.\n4.

Choice D, a person can certainly be energetic without having a great talent, so that doesn't fit either. \n7. Choice E, while a person may feel energetic about a performance, it doesn't necessarily relate to their talent.\n8. Finally, we are left with Choice C, 'anxiety', which most accurately describes the psychological impediment to performing in that it pertains to anxiety, and it also pertains to how that person's talent may feel or feel about performing. \n9. Therefore, choice C, 'anxieties' is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: Before a student becomes a doctor, they need first to complete a bachelor's degree in what? Choices: A: medicine B: nursing C: medicine D: nursing E: psychology\nRationales:1. The question is what one needs first to complete in order to become a doctor.\n2. When someone is going to a doctor, a doctor is usually someone who went to med school and is therefore a doctor.\n3. Considering Degree B: nursing, it means you would become a nurse first (because that degree is available for you to choose from), and then afterwards, you'd need to complete a doctorate degree in medicine in order to become a clinical specialist.\n4. Consider the other three options, they could be degrees that you would complete with your doctorate degree.\n5. Thus, the best option is A: medicine.\n6.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense either. When people are talented, it doesn't mean they never experience butterflies. It's also not a physical issue they would face. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't really fit either. Happiness isn't really related to performing, and a happy person can still enjoy their craft.\n6. Choices E, 'energetic', and B, 'talent people cannot suffer from injury and from butterflies', are also both not appropriate, as energicness isn't related to performing, and 'talent people' is a misused plural form of 'person'. \n7. Now, we are left to consider choice C, 'anxiety'. When it comes to performing, people are often anxious about doing a good job, getting a good impression or looking good on stage, but this isn't necessarily a concern that prevents people from performing. \n8. Therefore, it is most likely that the person in question suffers from anxiety but isn't prevented from performing.\nAnswer: C, anxiety.

{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense as there is no connection between the two, and the phraseology is not common enough to be considered part of standard English. Also, suffering from injury and nervousness may not explain why a person is not performing well. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense based on the question as it does not provide a reason for anyone not liking to perform.\n6. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energy', are not mutually exclusive. It is still likely that someone has anxiety and suffers from butterflies. So, we can eliminate choice C. \n7. Looking at the remaining options, we can eliminate choice E because it doesn't explain why a person doesn't like performing. The person is given as someone with talent and the options available should describe the talent in question, which choice E does not do. \n8. Choice B also seems like a logical choice because the person has \"talent\", so should not suffer from injury.\n9. Therefore the answer to this question is 'talent persons cannot perform with talent but butterflies', but this is not the answer the question gives. \n10. So, we continue to search for the correct answer. \n11. Choice A, injury, doesn't fit with the question's context so it's not the answer. \n12. The best answer to this question, then, is B. Talent persons cannot suffer from injuries is a valid possibility and has all the relevant information. \nAnswer: B: injury", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "fly', refers to anxiety experienced in situations related to performing. \n5. Choice E, happiness, does not appear to be appropriate as being unhappy is not a physical affliction. \n6. So from this, we can safely remove choice options A, B and E. \n7. Choice C, anxiety, is not specific enough to describe a performance-related problem. It could relate to any kind of anxiety a person may have. \n8. Choice D, energetic, is unlikely because there is no explicit indication that this is what the answerer is trying to describe through use of the word \"energetic\". \n9. Therefore, it's reasonable to choose option D, anxiety, as it aligns more closely with the context of the question.\nAnswer: D. anxiety\n\nInput: A soda, coffee, tea, or bottle of juice are a few of what? Choices A: foods that won't lead to overweight B: foods that will lead to overweight C: things that are good to eat D: unhealthy items E: health items\nRationales:1. The question asks which of the following are good to eat.\n2. One way to approach this question is determining what 'good to eat' generally means. From this, we might reasonably conclude that generally, food is good for one to eat.\n3. From choice C, 'things that are good to eat', the definition appears to be more precise and refers to healthy options rather than unhealthy options. \n4. Similarly, choice B, 'foods that will lead to overeating', also refers specifically to items that are bad for one's health. \n5. There's no explicit mention of overeating being good. \n6. Now that we've narrowed the choices to B and C, the logical next step is to eliminate option A.\n7. Option A does not include any of the food items being compared to, e.g., it does not mention soda, coffee, juice, etc. \n8. We can continue to eliminate choices, starting with D, because D does not include any food items.\n9. Once we move on to eliminations, we'll see that B and C overlap in their answer choices.\n10.

This helps us eliminate choices C and B, as they can't be right if happiness fits. \n7. Therefore, anxiety is the most likely option because of how the context of the question is phrased, \"If someone is talented but doesn't like....\". \n8. This implies that they like to perform but are feeling some hesitation.\n9.

It melted. 5: It failed\nRationales: This task asks what the result of using the unplugged toaster was.\n1. Looking at the choices:\n2. Choice 1, It died, can be eliminated as we know the toaster was not plugged in. \n3. A death can also occur if the toaster is plugged in, so this doesn't differentiate enough from the other choices to be relevant for this task.\n4. Choices 2, 3, and 4 don\u2019t make sense, as it's unlikely a toaster would die, burn up, melt, or fail just because it was unplugged. \n5. The only remaining option (choice 5) is a realistic reaction to using an unplugged toast. \n6.

{"text": "fly', does not logically connect the premises, and does not make sense with the overall context. \n5. The premise of this question is that a talent person is uncomfortable performing and will now be suffering from anxiety and butterflies. Therefore, it is more plausible that the person is suffering from anxiety, not 'injury', or some other related psychological ailment.\n6. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', respectively, are too specific, as happiness is not a psychological issue and anxiety is not only caused be a mental reservation.\n7. Choices E, 'energy and energetic', are also irrelevant since 'energy' is a physical concept, not a psychological issue.\n8. Therefore the answer is C, 'anxiety'.\n9.

Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energy', respectively, also don't make sense in reference to a person who does not enjoy performing, as anxiety or energy can apply in multiple scenarios.\n6. The option 'D', 'happiness,' doesn't directly relate to enjoyment or lack thereof of performing.\n7. Choices C and F, 'having fun' and 'lack of motivation,' relate to the idea of enjoyment, but the person may experience apathy in performing rather than fear, so these can also be eliminated.\n8. The remaining two options, B and D, are both similar but have slightly different meanings. \n9. Choice D, happiness, is different from the answer we seek, 'butterflies'.\n10.

Choices E, 'anxiety', and F, 'happiness', don't fit either, as we know people can have any or a mix of both. \n7.

Choices:  a: tornado b: storm-drenched c: stormy d: thunder-storm e: dark-cloudy f: lightning-stormy\nRationales:\n1. The question is describing an area known for a heavy storm and then wants to know which adjective best fits in as a prefix for the adjective \u2018heavy\u2019.\n2. When discussing something with one element added to another the prefix is often added to the smaller element and is placed at the beginning of the new word.\n3. Choices A, \u2018storm-drenched\u2019; E, \u2018dark\u2019; F, \u2018lightning-stormy\u2019; do not adequately include the prefix which is added to the initial element of the word so they are not plausible answers.\n4. Choices B, \u2018stormy\u2019; D, \u2018thunder-stormy\u2019 all have \u2018stormy\u2019 added to the larger element which is a part of the new word. We can eliminate these choices as they don\u2019t follow the rules for what an acceptable answer is.\n5. Choince C, \u2018stormy-drenched\u2019 includes the prefix \u2018stormy\u2019 at the beginning of the two-part word, which fits the requirements of the question.\nAnswer: a: tornado\n\nInput: In which setting are people usually performing some form of dance?

Choice D, happiness, may seem to fit, but one could be happy and still suffer by not utilizing their talent.\n6. Therefore, the best option is Choice E, 'anxiety,' which is an internal emotional restriction that could prevent one from performing a talent.\nAnswer: E, anxiety\n\nInput: Is Ava interested in learning more about physics or math? Choices:  B: Yes, she is interested in learning more about math.  C: Yes, she is interesting in learning more about physics. D: She is not interested in learning more about any science topic. E: She is not interested, physics or math or any science topic\nRationales: Let's look at each choice in the context of Ava.\n1. Looking at Choice B, the question is about Ava, a person, not about physics, a science topic. \n2. Also, looking back at the question, noting Ava's intention to learn more about science implies she is not currently learning about anything. In other words, she either is not studying science or she is not studying anything else. Given this, Choice B cannot be the true answer.\n3. Choices C, D and E are talking about Ava, not about learning physics or math. Hence, those choices are also invalid.\n4. So, the best choice must be A: yes, she is interested in physics, indicating that Ava is currently learning physics and not learning about anything else.\nAnswer: C, physics.\n\nInput: I believe a person can tell of the color of someone else by looking at the color of their eyes.

C: You couldn't be more correct.\nRationales:1. The answer is in the title question.\n2.

Choice E, energetic, doesn't relate to anxiety and is not relevant to this type of question. \n8. Hence, out of the remaining choices, it makes sense to choose option D, anxiety.\nAnswer: D. anxiety\n\nInput: Is it safe to use pesticides during the rainy season?

{"text": "flys', is an unnecessarily rewording of the possible condition, making it a non-candidate. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is not an appropriate choice either, as being 'happy' does not necessarily mean 'having the confidence to perform.' \n6. When we take into account the fact that the person most likely is talented and likable, we can eliminate choice E, \"energetic,\" which seems to suggest that such a person is confident or enthusiastic about performing. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is the appropriate answer because it accurately represents both the condition of anxiety and the context of performing.\n8. Therefore 8, the answer is C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: What type of person would most likely be a good leader? Choices:  S: calm B: aggressive C: confident D: humble E: all of the above\nRationales: Understanding what kind of person would be a good leader depends on the situation and on what kind of qualities a leadership role requires.\n1. Considering the leadership context, it is important to consider the person\u2019s temperament and personality.\n2. Calmness may be an important attribute of a good leader during a crisis, for a leader with strong communication skills, for a leader that needs to stay in control of a crowd, or for a leader who needs to have the patience to build a long-term vision and work towards it.\n3. Aggressiveness may be a positive attribute in a leader who needs to convince the entire board, employees, students or society of an important decision and needs to be assertive and dynamic when communicating.\n4. Depending on the context in which the person can use their leadership skills, confidence may be more important.\n5. Humility may be a positive asset of leadership when a person needs to lead other leaders to achieve the best outcome\n6. Considering all the characteristics and options, a leader should most likely be confident and calm, which should be followed by having a humble personality.\nAnswer: A. All of the above and B.

{"text": "fly', doesn't really fit as it describes a person who may or may not like performing and may or may not have an injury.\n5. Choices C, D and E do not give information about anxiety, enjoyment of performing, and being happy or energetic.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety' and E, 'happiness' do not really give details about enjoyment of a performance. \n7. Therefore, considering the limitations in these two possibilities, the most relevant answer remains B: talent persons cannot be suffering from an injury and butterfy. \n8. To further narrow the choices, the question describes a talent as a person who cannot perform. Given that they might be very talented, it would be likely that they are in fact a performer. \n9. Now that we have eliminated choice A, 'injured', from consideration, we can start to look at the remaining choices from an active perspective.\n10. It is known that talent persons cannot be suffering an injury. Thus, we eliminate choice B, 'talent performers cannot suffer from injury and yet they perform and enjoy it' because it is an issue of enjoyment not the performance itself.\n11. Considering choice C, 'talent persons can suffer from anxiety and yet they perform and love it', we can eliminate this option because the idea of 'love it' seems too strong of an emotional attachment to a performance. \n12. Therefore, the only remaining option is Choice C, 'they suffer from anxiety and are happy enough.'\n13. Hence, the most logical answer is C: 'suffer from anxiety' and 'be happy enough.'\nAnswer: D: they suffer from anxiety and be happy enough.", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "flys', is also an irrelevant solution to the question, as it implies that talent is somehow immune to anxiety, thus contradicting the first sentence. \n5. Choice B, however, is an appropriate response to the second question about potential anxiety over performing. \n6. Choice C, however, addresses the first question related to enjoyment of performing and the answer is clearly 'no' for this choice, as enjoying performance is not related to anxiety.\n7. Choices D and E discuss potential results of anxiety, respectively, but still don't answer the actual question about a reservation over performing.\n8. In summary, we know that the person does have, possibly, a talent but dislikes performing and may exhibit anxiety as result, with choice B also possible but not appropriate. \n9. Therefore, it makes sense to choose Choice C, Anxiety, as it is a possible, plausible answer. \n10. It is important to understand that the 'persons' the author refers to in the initial statement aren't explicitly specified, and the context is thus broad enough to apply to any person with talent, not any specific persons in particular. \nAnswer: C: Anxiety\n\nInput: Which of these is unlikely a good place to find food?\nChoices:  A: grocery B: gas station C: drive-through D: cello E: trumpet\nRationales:\n1. The question is simply asking which, or what, is an unlikely best place to get the required food.\n2. Choice A, \"grocery\" may seem like a correct answer at first, however if the person is in the middle of nowhere, far from any possible transport connections, then the grocery would in fact be an unlikely best place to find needed food. \n3. So, the most apt choice is option D: \"cello\", meaning the instrument.\n4. That's because it is an unlikely best place in the middle of nowheresville.\nAnswer: D\"cello\"\n\nInput: At first, I had no idea what my best friend wanted me to get but after I asked 3 times she was finally willing to tell me.

{"text": "flys -' does not make sense because it contains two sentences in which the first has nothing to do with the second. \n5. Additionally, 'talent persons' is plural which makes it seem odd and the sentence ends with 'butterflys'. This choice is eliminated. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is not a term to express an enthusiasm towards performing, as anxiety relates more to a state of trepidation associated with the act of performing. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic' does not express a person who is talented or an art enthusiast. \n8. Choice D, \"happiness', is the most appropriate word to describe someone who has a deep love and connection with their craft.\n9. Therefore the most reasonable choice is D: happiness.\nAnswer: D. happiness\n\nInput: When I was a child I would often find myself in a classroom. When I went there, what would I want to do? Choices:  a. be a teacher's pet b. help children become well adjusted c. give a good answer to the teacher d. teach about my pet e. try and help the class\nRationales: It is important to first understand what the question is asking. The given information is that the narrator was a child and was frequently visiting a classroom (an elementary school). What does the narrator want to do when they're there? \nIn looking at choices, the narrator is more involved with the children in the class than the teacher. The teacher already knows what a good student looks like, so the narrator most likely wouldn't want to be a teacher's favorite student, but rather, a favorable mentor to a child. \nWhile the narrator also wouldn't want to give the same correct answer as the teacher, they also wouldn't want their answer to be worse than the child's (as it would harm their mentor-ship). \nFinally, the narrator isn't saying they want to help the teacher in general with the class; they have to do so in a more specific way.  \nThe next step is to decide what best fits an answer for what the narrator wants to do when they've gone to a classroom. \nLooking at the choices, options that the narrator would want to do when visiting", "answer": " 249"}
{"text": "files', is not correct because injury is a physical condition, not a psychological tendency, and butterflies is not an emotional state. \n5. 'Happiness', Choice C, relates to the opposite question, which asked about someone that's not happy with their performance, and so is not applicable. Choice E, which was given as a negative response to \"Butterflies?\", similarly, has no role in the context of the question and is excluded. \n6. Choice D, which was given as an example of an emotion that a performer would have before performing, relates to Choice E, 'Anxiety', and so it's eliminated. \n7. If we look at the potential choices that remain, we can see that the remaining options focus on emotions, and Choice D, 'Anxiety,' stands out as a common and easily applicable emotion that someone might feel due to a lack of desire to perform.\n8. Therefore the answer is D: Anxiety.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety.\n\nInput: A baseball player has to be good at one or two things what? Choices: A: running B: hitting C: fielding D: eating E: swimming\nRationales: A. We are given the general context of something to do with a baseball player. We are not provided any specific information in regards to what that something is. \nB. Looking at each possible answer, we can see that Choice A, 'running', is a very specific skill that only one (the runner) needs to focus on to be successful. This does not match the context, as 'running' is specific to one position. Thus, Choice A can be eliminated. \nC. In Choice B, 'fielding', we note that a player is required to be good at more than one thing. We can eliminate it. \nD. Eating is very similar to Choice B because we see that while one player is required to field during a baseball game, they only need to focus on their job, eating, during their time off. Thus, it can be eliminated.\nE. Choice E is similarly specific and does not make sense in the context provided. Thus, Choice E can also be eliminated.  This leaves Choice C as the only remaining choice. \n\nAnswer:", "answer": " 6"}

Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, could be relevant if the person was generally happy, which could influence their ability to perform. \n6. Choice B, \u2018anxiety\u2019, is a potential fit as it could cause emotional distress when performing if the anxious individual felt they would perform poorly.\n7. Thus, Choices C and E only remain as valid possibilities. \n8. Considering how C, \u2018anxiety', would relate to not performing, it makes sense that a person, with or without a talent, might suffer from anxiety, causing them not to perform. \n9.

Choices:  Price, cost, value, demand, supply\nRationales:1. The question asks about what else John needs to know before making a purchase.\n2. The given answer options are price, cost, value, and demand and supply. When determining the answer, it makes sense to look to all the given answer options to determine what John would be most concerned with before making a purchase. \n3. Considering the context of the question, when purchasing an item, a customer will be concerned not only with cost but other attributes such as value and the desire to obtain the product for cheap. These are most likely the attributes a customer would need to know to make their buying decision.\n4. Therefore, of the given options, only cost, value, and supply, relate directly to price. Demand, although referring to factors that may influence the price, is irrelevant. \n5. Value is relevant and can relate to price in certain circumstances. However, it could also be a miscommunication and the customer is referring to the general purchase price without taking into consideration its value. \n6. Therefore, the answer we should choose from the remaining options is Value.\nAnswer: Value\n\nInput: What could the child do if the door is locked?

{"text": "fly', is a nonsensical sentence and does not match the intention of the question.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energy', aren't relevant as they are emotional responses, not root causes of dislike or fear of performing.\n6. Since the question is looking to find an answer that doesn't relate to emotional or physical limitations of performing, Choice D, 'happiness', doesn't meet the requirement as it is neither an emotional or physical barrier that prevents performing. \n7. That eliminates all choices except Choice D, 'anxiety'.\n8. Looking at Choice D, 'exhaustion', this answer is very likely.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: exhaustion\nAnswer: C: exhaustion\n\nInput: If the wind blows at 29 mph, the flag is called what? Choices: A: down B: right C: good D: low E: red\nRationales: At the beginning of the quiz, you were shown a picture of a flag in which the arrow pointed to the right. \n1. Looking at the choices from the first question, A: down and C: good are not possible.\n2. Choice D, low, is not the correct answer as the wind is blowing, so the flag is not low.\n3. By comparing the word choice options and the picture that is shown after the first question, we can deduce that the correct answer is B: right.

{"text": "flys', does not make sense as that answer implies that performers cannot suffer from any type of discomfort. This does not include injury or anxiety, as many performers are likely to suffer from these issues.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', also do not fit as they are describing emotional responses, not necessarily what the person experiences before performing. \n6. Therefore, we are left with Choice E, 'energy', as the person experiences 'butterflies'.\n7. The term 'butterflies' is sometimes used to describe the feeling of nervousness and pre-performance anxiousness. \n8. Thus, the most logical answer is E: energetic \nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 180"}
{"text": "fliess', doesn't fit either as the question does not specify that it is impossible to have both an injury and butterfles. \n5. Choice D, happiness', seems to fit. A happy performer has no reason not to perform. But could this describe a performer who is performing their craft, but is actually unhappy doing so? \n6. No as it says that this person has no reason to perform. \n7. Choice E, \"anxiety\", does fit as these are associated psychological or emotional issues, which can cause one to not perform.\n8. Therefore to eliminate all of the choices except one, \"anxiety\" is the most logical choice. \n9. It means that if someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, they usually suffer from anxiety due to the fact that they don\u2019t want to perform.\nAnswer: E Anxiety\n\nInput: The students went to the park today. What do you think they had for lunch? Choices:  Rationales:\n A: ice cream B: tuna sandwich C: pizza D: steak sandwich E: no lunch\n Rationales:\n 1. The question gives some information about the students, suggesting that we should understand what lunch is typical for them.\n 2. Choice A, \"ice cream\", would be suitable for after their meal but not for lunch.\n 3. Choice B, \"tuna sandwich\", fits the description as being a popular lunch food of students.\n 4. Choice C \"pizza\", might be common as well, as pizza is a traditional student favourite.\n 5. Choice D \"steak sandwich\", is likely a favorite at a student's home, but it doesn't say anything about the meal the students ate today. \n 6. Finally, Choice E, \"no lunch\", is unlikely because although there are students who don't eat a conventional breakfast or lunch, it is unlikely to have a universal impact on the entire student population.\n 7. Therefore the best answer is Choice B, \"Tuna sandwich\".\nAnswer: B Tuna sandwich\n\nInput: Many people have to work during the summer, but students do not.

{"text": "fly', is also eliminated because 'butterfly' isn't an option. Not only does it make little sense, it is not valid grammar. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", can be inferred to be related to performances, but happiness is a more general term that can't necessarily be attributed to a specific activity.\n6. Therefore, the answer left is Choice E, 'anxiety'. \n7. Looking even closer to the options, choice C, 'anxiety', is the best of the choices which have an implied psychological nature and a connection to performing in public.\nAnswer: E. anxiety\n\nInput: To whom does a woman refer when she says, \"My grandmother's friend was such a kindhearted woman\"? Choices: A: the kindhearted B: such a woman C: our dear friend D: the nice lady E: a dear friend\nRationale: All of the below choices could be considered appropriate to describe a person. 1. The woman is describing some person and in the process, indicates that this person is kindly. 2. As such, we have four possible options here. 3. Let's begin by eliminating all the options that are in some way inappropriate. 4. Option (B) \"such a woman\" would be incorrect because \"woman\" or \"women\" aren't capitalized in that way. 5. Option (E) \"a dear friend\" could be an appropriate description, but it could also be describing more than one person and in any case is not capitalized correctly. 6. Option (C) \"our dear friend\" is an appropriate description but is not capitalized correctly; besides, the sentence isn't a question, so there's no need to make any description capitalized. 7. Option (D) \"the nice lady\" is an adjective that is describing a person or group of people. 8. Therefore, it appears that the correct answer is Option (D) \"a nice lady\".\nAnswer: D. a nice lady\n\nInput: What could a man who is looking to cut down on time and/or expense when he flies?

Looking at C, we know that butterflies are usually emotional feelings of nervousness or excitement. It can be related a performance as someone could perform very well or very badly and experience these emotional feelings in the process, but its not a psychological reservations about performing.\n8.

{"text": "fly's', doesn't make sense since they are two separate issues, not one.\n5. Choices C, D, E are all emotional, psychological concerns that may accompany nervousness, which does make sense for what a person might feel if they're not comfortable performing in front of a crowd.\n6. The question states there is a feeling of discomfort towards performance itself, so it would make sense that the person is suffering from anxiety or perhaps nervousness, not just one of the other feelings listed by itself.\n7. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'nervous', are both feelings related to anxiety, but don't need to be combined with each other.

Since the options are 1, 3, and 5 away from 1969, we can say 1950 is within 1, 3 and 5 of 1969. We can eliminate 1 and 3. 47-50=3. 47 could be 1947. We can eliminate 47. This narrows our possible choice to 1950.\nAnswer: D.\n\nInput: If a person is trying a food they've never tried before, they will likely feel what? Choices: A: nervous B: fearful C: excited D: elated E: apprehensive\nRationales:\nIf a person is trying a new food, they may feel nervous, fearful, excited, elated or apprehensive. Looking at the given choices, we can easily eliminate choices B and E. \nChoice A is 'nervous' as this is a word that directly matches the description of the reaction the person is feeling.\nChoice C is 'excited' as this is another response that matches the situation.\nChoice D is 'elated', in the sense that they were elated at what they tasted. \nChoice E is 'apprehensive', in the sense that the person may", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "fly[s]', is related to how the person deals with stress because of their talent, not because they're suffering from a mental condition. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't quite fit, as it may be correlated with a person's anxiety at the idea of performing but it doesn't mean they can't perform. \n6. In contrast to the previous choices, Choice E, 'energetic', feels like a solid option. It conveys a person who can get excited, and it also encompasses anxiety. The word 'butterflies' suggests a person who suffers from anxiety.\n7. A person with talent who does not enjoy performing an art typically suffers from anxiety because of their performance. Thus, the answer should be E: energetic.\n8. Therefore the answer is E: energetic, because the person suffers from anxiety about what they're performing due to their talent.\nAnswer: E, energetic\n\nInput: A woman and child were sitting on the park bench, a bee flew underneath it, why? Choices: \tA: it was looking for food B: it was avoiding the cold C: it was pollinating D: it was being too quiet E: it was looking for something more interesting to do than sit on the bench\nRationales: The first thing to be clear about is the nature of 'why?'. The question is asking, what drove the bee into its situation.\n1. Let's look at the options:\nA: it was looking food\nC: it was pollination\n- A is not specific enough as it can be looking of food anywhere, and C is a noun which can be used as a verb.\n2. Option B: it was avoidng the cold, does not quite fit the general idea of the question because it indicates that the environment was cold as opposed to it saying the the woman and child were.\n3. Option E: it was looking at something more interesting to do, does not reflect the idea of the question and is therefore incorrect.\n\n4. Choices A, B, and C would all make sense since 'bees are driven by a desire to collect food, spread pollen, and avoid cold.\n\n5. In addition, 'it was being too quiet' isn", "answer": " 131"}
{"text": "fly', while amusing, is not accurate, as it isn't a psychological reservation. It can be an issue that makes one unable to perform.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energy', do describe psychological issues that can affect performance, but they do not apply to the entire sentence. \n6. Choice D, happiness, is the key here, as it makes the most sense. The term \"happiness\" does not restrict to acting or any other performance, implying the issue is just in not performing in general and, by extension, performance art.\n7. Therefore the answer to this question is D: happiness.\nAnswer: D happiness\n\nInput: What could possibly happen if a person accidentally walks under a bus while its parked on the street? Choices:  N/A A: may suffer serious injury B: may suffer injury C: may not suffer injury D: may not suffer anything\nRationales: The question is asking what is possible when a person walks under a parked bus.\nIf you're asking, is it possible that this person could injure themselves walking under the bus? The answer is clearly choice C. None of the other answers is possible, or even makes sense in this case.\nHowever, if this was simply a general question about walking under the bus, and the person is not necessarily in danger, then option D is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D. The person could not be injured while walking under a parked bus unless something unexpected happened to cause the bus to move.\n\nInput: What happened to the cat\u2019s life after it jumped off the cliff? Choices:  It lost its life. It made the jump. It died on landing. It broke its spine. It fell to its death.\nRationales: This question is asking for the outcome of the cat's life after it jump off the cliff. The other four answers imply the opposite of what happened. The right answer is:\nIt lost its life.\nThe cat lost its life after it jumped.\nAnswer: E. the cat lost its life after jumped off the clifftop\n\nInput: The woman wanted to know whether what was possible.

{"text": "fly', is confusing because it doesn't explain what the dislike for performing refers to. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't relate to a person's feelings toward performing on stage, it relates to emotional well-being.\n6. Choices C and E are similar, both indicating mental states, so eliminating one leaves us with only one option.\n7. In this case, the chosen option must be either directly related to the dislike for performing on stage, or have been excluded previously as irrelevant. \n8. Because option E, \"energetic\", is the most similar to \"performance\" in that it suggests being active, but it doesn't necessarily describe feeling nervous about performing, nor does it imply negative feelings. \n9. In contrast, answer C, \"anxiety\", is the most appropriate choice because it does indicate the dislike for performing and the related nervousness.\n10. Therefore, the answer would be option C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: People who are going to a sports event such as a football game, should have tickets because? Choices:  A. Tickets are necessary so that people don't get mad B. Tickets are not necessary so that ticket sellers don't get upset C. Tickets are free so that everyone goes D. Tickets are required by the law so that organizers don't get in trouble E: Tickets are free\nRationales:1) The question is asking why it is important for sporting spectators to have tickets.\n2) Let us quickly eliminate choices which are incorrect because they do not pertain to spectators or sports events.\n3) Choice B, \"people don't get mad,\" wouldn't be true in a scenario where spectators are being prohibited from coming in.\n4) Choice D, \"organizers don't get in legal trouble,\" doesn't describe a situation where organizers are trying to sell tickets to spectators, but rather they prohibiting people from getting involved.\n5) Choice E, \"everyone goes,\" does not pertain to specific people going to events, but refers to the crowd as a whole.\n6) With only choice C left, we can determine that it is not correct because there are several scenarios", "answer": " 375000"}
{"text": "lies,' doesn't make sense as 'butterflies' is usually an archaic term people use to describe nervous energy, and being nervous isn't a reason to dislike performing. \n5. Choice E,  'energetic,' doesn't make much sense as someone who is energy would likely have the opposite problem of this person - wanting to perform and not feeling nervous about doing so. \n6. Therefore, the answer appears to be Choice C, 'anxiety,' making sense in the context of the question and fitting with the other information given about the person in question. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: Why does the carrot's hair get so tangled while cooking? Choices: 1. A: because of the amount of sugar he takes in. 2. B: the shampoo he washes his hair with is not good enough. 3. C: it's all because the drain of the sink is not unclogged. 4. D: the water is too hot. 5. E: it is because he is using very dirty water.\nRationales: The correct answer is C.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: Why does carrot's hair gets so tangled while cooked? Excuse: This question doesn't make sense.\nRationales Explanation: (1). The question makes sense, carrot hairs are usually tangled.\n(2). Because the drain is not unclog and water is heated.\n(3). The correct answer is C, the drain is not cleared, so the hot water is unable to escape from the carrot's body, which causes the water to become too warm, and when the water is too hot, it becomes difficult to untangle.\n(4). Carrot washed his body with very dirty water.\n (5). It is because he is using dirty water, the body will become dirty, and the carrots hair will be very tangled.", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "flys', does not make sense as it is written. The choice does not logically follow from the sentence before it. Further, the word 'butterflys' is misspelled and should be spelled 'butterflies' instead. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\" would be good if the response had been focused on how the person feels and did not specify a particular reason for their feelings. \n6. Choice C, ``anxiety'' is a common reaction to a situation in which a person is worried about something happening. This choice is plausible for a response, as someone can struggle to perform due to feeling nervous. \n7. Choice E, ''energetic'', is a feeling or emotion that a person experiences, and thus cannot be the answer. \n8. Therefore, we can narrow our focus down to Choice B and Choice C where the person has difficulty performing due to either physical issues like an injury or psychological issues like anxiety.\n9. In the end, Choice B, 'anxiety', is the correct answer as it describes the main reason given in the statement that someone who has a talent but doesn't enjoy performing may suffer 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: B: anxiety", "answer": " 1944"}
{"text": "fly', is not justified by the context of the question, which only mentions the sufferer's resistance to performing. \n5.

{"text": "fly', is an unnecessary statement that changes the meaning of the question. The phrasing in the question is, 'they probably suffer from what?', so we don't need to consider this as an answer choice.\n5. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', both require 'the person' to be unhappy or happy, and both exclude possible causes of that person's reluctance to perform. There is no reason to assume they are unhappy. Perhaps they are just simply uninterested in performing for some reason. \n6. Choice B, a 'talent persons cannot... ', may seem plausible. However, talent persons would indeed suffer from anxiety about performing, especially if performing is a source of competition and pressure to succeed. \n7. Choice B's assertion does not make a compelling claim and does not explain why the person who is a talent does not enjoy performing. We need to consider other possible reasons.\n8. Choice D, \"energetic\", does not directly relate to performing, and thus it's an unnecessary distraction when considering why a person is not performing. \n9. Thus the only answer that makes sense to me is Choice D: 'happiness'.\nAnswer: D: 'happyness'.\n\nInput: What word in spoken languages has the most syllables in it?

A: by two people putting their toothbrushes together 2. B: by people that brushed their teeth together 3. C: by two people brushing their teeth together 4. D: by people that put their toothbrush together 5. E: by two people brush their teeth together\nRationales: Let's first define our choice letters and words. Choice \"A\" is the word \"two\", which describes two things, a person or people. Choice \"B\" is the word \"people\", which refers to humanity. Choice \"C\" is the word \"toothbrush\", which refers to a specific personal tool used for brushing teeth. Choice \"D\" is the word \"brush\", which refers more to the action of brushing than to specific toothbrushes in general. Then, we'll proceed to the steps. Choice A is formed by two people putting their personal tools \"together.\" This doesn't make sense, because how can you \"put two things together\"? Choice B is formed after two people doing the same action \"together.\" This works and we may write it down as an option. The rest of the terms are in a similar format where people or objects do an action together. In choice D, when two people place a personal item together, the word \"brush\" appears. The other words we encounter are made up of different actions two people or objects perform together. In choice E, we find the answer and we may write it as an option.\nAnswer: E \"by two people brushing their tooth\"", "answer": " 220"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as two words that are typically not related. This is because a butterfly has no relevance to the question and talent is not generally described as a person (although a specific form of it may be).\n5. Choice D, happiness, is also not relevant as although happiness may affect someone's ability to perform, it is not what the question is asking for. \n6. Choice C, anxiety is a common psychological condition that prevents many people from performing in front of others. Therefore, it could be what the talent person in question is suffering from. \n7. Furthermore, we also know that anxiety is a feeling one can have before performing. It is thus, fitting to say that someone who doesn't like performing likely suffers from anxiety. \n8. Therefore, it does make sense to choose option C, anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety", "answer": " 25"}

Choice D, on the other hand, makes sense and fits the context in which we expect to see people talented in performing - 'happiness' - is an effect of performing. \n6. Finally, Choice E, 'energetic', would also seem like a plausible answer for someone who suffers from 'butterflies' (nervousness or anxiety), as people who are usually energetic tend to be better able to deal with such situations.\n7. Therefore the choice that matches the context of the question is, 'D: happiness'.\nAnswer: D: happiness", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "flys', is grammatically incorrect. We must consider the intended meaning of the sentence, which is that talent persons typically cannot suffer from injury and also feel anxious. This option does not fit the criteria, as it seems to be providing a general statement that everyone, talent or not, cannot feel pain or anxious. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", does not relate to a performance skill since performing is often something one does out of interest or passion rather than happiness. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is an internal emotion that can be triggered by one\u2019s performance if they are self-conscious or insecure. Anxious feelings could manifest themselves differently in each person, but generally it is an internal condition that's not readily apparent in the outer environment. Similarly, \"happiness\" is more of a feeling than it is an observable condition. Thus, only \"anxiety\" is likely to apply here. \n7. Therefore, it is likely the best answer is D, \"anxiety\".\nAnswer: D : Anxiety\n\nInput: When you first began teaching, was there anything that made you feel insecure?

Choices E, 'energetic', and D, 'happiness', aren't good choices because they are both words that refer to positive emotions. Negative emotions also cause suffering.\n8.

To find the answer, we can eliminate options that do not match the given pattern in each cell.\n3. Option C, \"ABC\", does not match the pattern of \"3 4 2\" as \"ABC\" is read as \" A B C\" and has a \"2\" in the middle instead of a \"3\".\n4.

Choice A contains \"adult women\", which are adult women. And these can only have fun together with those of the same sex and dogs, which would be adult people and animals. \n2.

Choices: \nA: it shows them appreciation B: they have too much work left C: it saves the company money D: it could show the company appreciation E: it is a legal requirement\nRationales: The question asks why a company might give employees a day off.\n1. Choices A, B and C do not have anything to do with the question. A day off only relates to companies that offer it to their employees, which isn't a good fit to the question.\n2. Option E is technically something they could choose to do, but it's only one of the reasons, so one can only eliminate Choice E from the answer options.\n3. Choices A and D do not make sense for the question. \n4. Option B, \"it shows them appreciation\", can be seen to possibly relate to employees needing a day off to appreciate them, but as employees receive regular paydays and are likely paid fairly, this does not sound like why they want a day off.\n5. Choices C, D, E and F can be eliminated, making the answer E, \"it is a legal requirement\".\nAnswer: \nE: it is a legal requiement\n\nInput: The most reliable way to detect a crime is by?

{"text": "fly', is not actually a response to this question. It is a response to the question, 'can talented people not suffer from injury'?\n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit as this refers to the person performing rather than the experience of performing.\n6. Choices C and E, anxiety and 'energy levels' respectively, don't make sense either as the person will experience anxiety before performing, but not after. \n7. We also know that energy in performers isn't exclusive to high and low energy levels, and thus can't be the answer either. \n8. Therefore, we have narrowed it down to Choices B (cannot suffer from injury and butteryflies) and D (happiness).\n9. Choice D, while still irrelevant, has been provided as the word, 'butterflies', implies excitement or nervousness, which is still a psychological reservation. However, the question implies the person is resisting performing the talent, which can't be satisfied by excitement. This provides an answer of Choice B, that the person doesn't like performing due to the fact that they are suffering from anxiety. \nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot sustain from injury and butteryls\n\nInput: The following response is incomplete. Which statement best addresses the response? Choices:\n1. A: I'm always at the party.\n2. B: I had a good time at the party yesterday.\n3. C: Sorry I wasn't at the party.\n4. D: I had a great time at the party last night.\n5. [E] I go to the party whenever I can, usually around 8.\nRationales: One. Choice A, \"I'm always at the Party\", doesn't make sense in context. The other answers don't use a similar structure. Choices B, C, and D do seem to suggest a pattern in which someone attended a party when they were asked about it, but this is too general for the question and lacks specificity.\n2. Choice E, \"I go to the party when I can usually around eight PM\", best addresses the response. It is the most specific, addressing what \"I\" says and doing so based on what \"I\" can attend, a party. This implies a time as well,", "answer": " 96"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense. This is an improperly constructed sentence that doesn't resemble an accurate thought process.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and E 'energy', would imply a more positive result. These options suggest that the performer is nervous about performing, but this contradicts the underlying statement.\n6. Choices B and C, 'butterflies' and 'anxiety', also fit this context.\n7. Ultimately, however, we are looking for any potential issue that would impair this person from performing. \n8. Therefore, choice D, 'anxiety', fits the context and should be the most appropriate answer.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety\n\nInput: The weather is not great this morning, it's cloudy which means it's the ____. Choices:  A. Sunny B. Rainy C. Gloomy D. Unknown E. Blue\nRationales:\n2. Choice A is not the answer because it's always sunny at 6am. \n3. Same with B, never raining. \n4. Therefore, the answer to the question is C, which means it's overcast and it's cloudy. \nAnswer: C. Overcast\n\n### Instructions: The following directions for a simple experiment are given.

Choice E, E: energetic, doesn't make sense because someone with this attribute wouldn't be likely to suffer from anxiety.\n6. We can eliminate choice B, C: happiness, and D: butterflies because these choices don't fit within this scenario as they are describing psychological conditions or reactions to a stimulus that an anxious person wouldn't feel.\n7. What we have left is choice A, B, and C. \n8. In this instance, choice C, 'anxiety', does the best job of expressing the condition and reservations of the person not feeling performing. \n9.

{"text": "flies', while clever, is incorrect as there doesn't seem to be a context that suggests it makes sense.  5. Choice C & D, 'talent persons are often anxious and energy', are correct but aren't specific to the context given which is one individual having a reluctance to perform. \n6. Thus, we are left with a choice between C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energetic', which both fit but only one is relevant to the context.\n7. Therefore one must choose between Choice E, 'energetically', and Choice C, 'anxious'.  8. In this instance, one must choose a term that best describes that someone who has talent but is afraid to perform might be. \n9. In this context, someone having anxiety makes more sense than energetic because a person with high energy and confidence may have no reservations about performing onstage.  10. Therefore the correct answer is C: anxious.\nAnswer: C. anxious\n\nInput: Where should you be looking for directions if you're lost?

{"text": "flys', doesn't directly answer the question - it doesn't make sense to ask about another person's psychological reservation as a way to identify the cause of another person's psychology reservation.\n5. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energetic', could be related causes of nervousness or butterflies in the stomach for a performer, however, the question is asking about what causes talent people to not perform. \n6. Therefore, these are not the correct answer.\n7. Looking again at the choices, it appears that Choice B, 'butterflies', is a possible answer as it describes the phenomenon of someone feeling nervous in a performance environment.\n8. However, 'butterfiness' isn't a logical word and Choice B, 'anxiety', is more specific and common than 'butterflies'. So, Choice B, 'Butterflies' probably isn't the correct choice.\n9. Looking again, Choice D, 'Happiness', describes the feeling of a person who is content/happy to do or not do something, which is similar to being talent and not liking to perform. So, in this scenario, the person probably isn't happy with their talent. Considering Choice D, 'happiness' provides a reasonable explanation.\n10. Therefore, the best option is D: happiness.\nAnswer: D. Happiness\n\nInput: The word 'deal' means what?

The options are: (A) to cheat, (B) to negotiate, (C) to sell, (D) to take advantage of someone, (E) to share.\n2. 'Deal' can refer to any of these actions (A-D), but this does not narrow down the answer options.\n3. If we remove the answers that don't refer to a deal (E), we are left with answers A, B, & C.\n4.

This seems like it makes the most sense given that an enjoyment of performing is considered a benefit to talent people, whereas a lack of enjoyment would be more likely to be viewed as a drawback.\n7.

Choices E, 'energetic', again doesn't make sense and sounds like an incomplete statement. \n7. We can eliminate all the choices except two - C and D. \n8. Choice C, anxiety, is a state of nervousness and stress, which could be a result of performing, and can be associated with talent but not necessarily the case of being a talent person.\n9. Then, we have choice D, 'happiness', which is something one feels, can be a result of performing but does not necessarily apply to a talent person specifically.\n10.

{"text": "fly', also doesn't make sense as it suggests that if someone has a talent, then they cannot be injured or anxious. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", sounds too simplistic and would not account for a variety of different feelings - including anxiety and aversion. \n6. Choice D, does not account for anxiety and aversion as it indicates happiness is a personality trait. \n7. Choice E, \"energy', doesn't account for any feelings of anxiety. An energy, when positive, usually refers to excitement, not anxiety.\n8.

First, we will look at the options as possibilities, then narrow them down after reading their definitions. \n3. Option A, 'clothes', is a general term that would include anything considered to be clothing, not just dress shirts.\n4. Option B, 'tailors', means \"a person who operates a loom\", or something that has to do with fabric. It isn't a clothing store.\n5. Option C, 'boutiques', are small, independently-owned shops. It doesn't sound like that's what the speaker is looking for. \n6. Options D and B may seem to be related, but option D is a specific style of store, not a general term. \n7.

Choice I, \"a habit\", describes something done regularly; however, this is too general to answer our question. \n\n2. Choice I, B) \"a tradition\", means \"somebody\u2019s ways of doing things and the beliefs and values connected to them\". Thus, this is a correct but irrelevant answer. It would be better to choose from those options that are more direct.\n\n3. Choice II, C) \"a routine\", is defined as \"a particular sequence of actions depending on a situation\". Therefore, it does make sense we use a routine when performing a habit. Considering this, this answer may be the most plausible and we should take a closer look. \n\n4. Choice II, \"a ritual\", is a more specific term than a routine, which is defined as a sequence of actions. However, it is still too general to provide a specific answer. \n\n5.

Choices:  A the customer B away from customer C the customer away from shoe D the shoe away from the customer\nRationales: Let's start by eliminating options that don't make sense based on the context. First, Choice A is \"the customer\". The shoe fits or does not fit the customer. However, the customer, not the shoe, is being discussed in the question, so option A is not relevant. Option B is \"away from the customer\", so it is also removed. Next, it's possible that a good option is \"the customer away from the shoe\". For instance, is it easier to throw the shoe away, or remove the customer first? This option, however, makes no sense, as the shoemaker is trying to encourage the customer to throw the shoe, which would mean that the customer has already been removed from the shoe.\nOption C is \"away from customer\", so it is not relevant either.

Thus, they should be able to answer this question using any knowledge that they may possess about these types of words.\n\nRationales: One of the words provided and then removed is \"knight\". The answer to this question should be the word \"knife.\"\n\nInput: You work at a job that pays well and is easy to get ahold of. What kind of job is it?

{"text": "lies', is incorrect because the statement is talking about talent persons in general, not just those that suffer from injury. Therefore, it is not a potential answer. \n5. Choice D, happiness, also doesn't make sense because happiness is a state of being and not a particular psychological issue. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is closely related to the topic of the question and seems to make the most sense when one is considering the definition of anxiety. Anxiety is described as an emotional experience characterized by feelings of nervousness, apprehension, and worry. Therefore, this choice seems to most directly align to the information being asked about. It also makes explicit sense that someone with anxiety would experience nervousness, appreheension, and worry. \n7. By eliminating all other choices from these categories, it's clear that choice C, anxiety, makes the most sense.\nAnswer: C : anxiety\n\nInput: Which number is missing from the sequence below? Choices: 13 11 23 57 25\nRationales:1. The question is looking for what number is currently missing from the sequence listed.\n\nAnswer: 3\n\nInput: Which of the following is a real number? Choices: 3/214 1/2013 25 0.5\nRationales1. The questions asks for which number is a real number.\n2. Looking closely we see that the first two options in the list are real numbers. The last two are numbers that would be defined as rational numbers or fractional numbers.\n3. 3/21 is a real number and 25.\nAnswer: 3/27\n\nInput: What are the major differences between the way water is used in this country [of unknown origin] and that of this country [of known origin]?

C) The countries have both equally dirty and clean water. D) This country takes water more seriously while the other countries take it more light-heartedly. E) This country uses more plastic water bottles and the other country uses more water bottles.\nRationales: A major difference is the level", "answer": " 106000"}
{"text": "' means this is incorrect. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\", is also eliminated because it's not a talent. Awareness is not necessarily a talent, and some performers also don't have this talent.\n6. Choices A, B and D are therefore eliminated. \n7. Choice C is also eliminated as anxiety, in its more severe forms, can prevent individuals from performing out of fear.\n8. Answer E, \"energy\", fits with the context. \n9. This implies that performance anxiety can lead to \"butterflies\", or feelings of nervousness that can affect on a person's ability to perform. This is a form of anxiety, as it is psychological in nature, and it impacts specific parts of performing.\n10. Hence, performing anxiety, as mentioned above, is the best answer to this question.\nAnswer: B: Performing anxiety\n\nInput: There were several candidates available to be appointed to an important position. How long the process would take was unknown? Choices:  the entire time or until the newest candidate came forward A: all of them had a shot B: none of them had a chance C: they all had different levels of qualification and experience D: any of them could be considered a good candidate for the position E: all of the above\nRationales:\n1. The process was unknown - this means time it would take for someone to be appointed to an 'important position' is unknown.\n2. So, if we use this to reason out the answer choices, we will go with the choices that make the most sense for this scenario.\n3. Let's look at the choices we have above: none of the candidates had a chance, they would have different levels of qualifications, and any of them could be a good candidate for the job.\n4. Looking at the process and the time factor we can see that each candidate has their own ability to be selected and they were all available to be appointed at some point, and hence, the above statement makes sense.\n5. The correct response is Choice D which means they were available to be appointed at any time.\n\nInput: A group of 20 people each were allocated $17 and had to work with the same amount of money to buy a particular gift. How? Choices:  give someone the extra money", "answer": " 1500"}
{"text": "fly' also doesn't make sense as it states both 'talent persons' and 'injury' are invalid, however, the only thing stated as being invalid is the term 'injury'. \n5. Choice D, happiness is also not a possible response as this is the opposite of the wording used in the question. Happiness here would suggest the person is fond of performing. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, makes sense because anxiety is a common emotion that arises when you are performing, especially if you don't feel confident in yourself. This makes it the answer because anxiety is a psychological response that can cause nervous symptoms and feelings.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: To get more customers, many small businesses now offer a what? Choices: A: business B: personal C: public service D: personal service E: personalized\nRationales: Option A, \"Business\" is not a service.\nOption C, \"Public service\" does not give enough information that this is a service for small business. \n\nOption D, \"Personal service\" does not give this information only saying \"Personal service\".\n\nOption E, \"Personalized\" only says \"Personalized\" and does not give enough information.\n\nOption B, Business, is the answer given.\n\nAnswer: B: Business\n\nInput: A shy person would likely be how the majority of people will perceive them? Choices: A. overly aggressive. B. quiet C. loud D. unsociable E. self-assured \nRationales: Choice C, \"loud,\" is incorrect because \"quiet\" and \"loud\" form antonyms. \n\nChoice D, \"unsociable,\" is incorrect because \"sociable\" is the opposite of \"unsociable.\" \n\nOption E, Self-assured, is the answer to the question. \n\nAnswer: E: self-assured.\n\nInput: What color hair does the woman with the short hair with tanned skin and purple eyes have?

{"text": "flys', is incorrect as 'butterflies' is not a word. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is likely not a consequence of not enjoying performing, since happiness is typically defined as one's emotional state or well-being. \n6. The likely answer is Choice E, 'anxiety', because anxiety is often a common consequence of not enjoying something, such as performing.\nAnswer: E Anaxiety\n\nInput: One's job application to a car service agency should not provide their marital status or whether or not they have had a blood test? Choices:  a. true b. correct c. false d. unsure\nRationales:1. The question is whether or not a job application to a car repair service agency should be required to include information about marital status or a recent blood test.\n2. Choice 'a' is an acceptable, factual response. \n3. 'Correct' or 'correct' should not be used in place of the literal answer to the question itself. \n4. 'False' can be excluded since the answer has already been provided as literal, factual information. \n5. 'Unsure' is incorrect because an affirmation response is required. \nAnswer: 'a'\n\nInput: If a person is tall with brown eyes and has a very wide nose, then they probably have what? Choices: a. tall head b. a wide nose c. brown eyes d. thin legs\nRationales: The question is asking what might have the effect of making someone with these physical attributes appear shorter.\n1. Choice 'a. tall head', is incorrect because a 'tall head' is not an attribute that would make someone appear shorter.\n2. Choose 'c. brown eyes', is incorrect because neither brown nor blue eyes would affect one's perceived height.\n3. Choices 'b. a wide nose' and 'd. thin legs' are reasonable possibilities, given the fact that narrow and large attributes, respectively, could be perceived as making one's height appear smaller.\n4. However, the question only asks about attributes that impact one's height perception, and thus does not allow for a non-perceptible attribute such as blue eyes. \n5. So, the best answer must come from 'a. brown eyes or", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "flys' is incorrect for similar reasons as choice A. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is irrelevant to the question because it is a positive emotion. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is probably the best fit. \n7. According to the text, the person is likely to have a talent but doesn't enjoy performing. \n8. The result of the person's reservation will likely be an anxious state in relation to performing their talent. \n9. Thus, the best choice choice for the question is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C anxiety", "answer": " 8798"}
{"text": "lies', isn't an answer as it isn't an actual question, plus it's vague and doesn't directly relate to the person's possible concern about performing. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't a reservation about performance, which suggests it's not the correct answer here. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is related to performing but it refers to an emotional response, not a mental reservation. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic,\" is not a psychological feeling either but only a descriptive word. \n8. Given that the remaining options all relate to a more internal perspective toward performance, it seems more likely that the answer should be related to an issue or emotion. Also, while \"butterflies\" are a physical problem, the question also points out that it is a psychological one. \n9. Therefore, it seems reasonable to eliminate all options except an answer related to feelings and psyche. \n10. Choice B, \"anxiety,\" seems to directly fit the criteria here.", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense, given that they're a single, unrelated choice. It's likely that the person is talking about anxiety. \n5. Choice D, does not fit either, as the question doesn't specify that the person is happy.\n6. Therefore, as Choices B, C and D are irrelevant, the best options are A and E. \n7. Based on the information provided in the question, however, it seems like the person is suffering from anxiety rather than happiness. \n8. Although the idea of suffering from happiness is not entirely fallaciou, choice D, happiness, is unlikely in this case.\n9. Therefore the best answer is A, anxiety.\nAnswer: A. anxiety\n\nInput: In which situation could it be most sensible that someone might be looking for a pen? Choices:  ----------> A: An interview B: The baggage claim C: Class D: The dentist E: The movie theatre F: A trip to the dentist\nRationales:  1. This question is asking about the situation in which it might be most sensible that someone would be looking for a pen.\n\n2. Interview, baggage claim, class and dentist are all different locations in which people go on a regular basis. To answer the question, it isn't important to determine which location is the most sensible, but rather which location the answer provided is referring to.\n3. Therefore, the best option is to determine which of the locations listed could plausibly refer to a movie theater.\n4. Choices A, B, D and F, all seem a likely answer. While the others seem implausible, they cannot be immediately disregarded without considering the context.\n\n5. Option A is implausible for the following reasons:\n        - an interview is typically not associated with purchasing stationary\n        - a trip to the dentist is not a typical situation for buying something to write with such as a pen\n6. Option B is implausible because:\n        - a baggage carousel is a location in which someone unpacks their luggage, however, the pen they are purchasing is something they probably use on a regular basis. \n6. Choice C is plausible but not the most likely option because:\n        - as classes tend to be short", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "fly', is technically accurate, but is too specific with the added detail \"injury and butterfly\". This makes the entire statement seem vague and nonspecific. \n5. Choice D, happiness, makes no sense within this context as the person has been described as having a \"talent, but doesn't like them\". Being happy is not a psychological barrier to performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, would describe the correct psychological feeling, however, there seems to be a specific detail of the feeling. Anxiety does not refer to a specific type of anxiety - you could feel anxious over anything, so this seems unnecessary. \n7. Choice E, \"energy\", does not mean anxiety. The choice refers to a feeling of joy and optimism as \"energetic\". This can be confused as the person feeling anxious, so it should be eliminated from the list. \n8. Finally, we are left with Choice B, which states \"talent persons cannot suffer talent butterfly\", which can be interpreted as someone suffering from butterflies due to talent which they don't like. Thus, this means that this is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D - \"anxiety\"\n\nInput: The ___ is the structure that has the hardest time absorbing impact.\nChoices:  A: bone B: spleen C: bladder D: stomach E: rib\nRationale: A thorough analysis of the given question states that the ___ that has the hardest of time absorbing impact is the rib. Choices A, B, C, D, and E are all incorrect. Choice A is not correct because a rib has to absorb shock to protect the internal organs. Choice B is not correct because the spleen is a soft organ. Choice C is not correct because the bladder is flexible. Choice D is not correct because the stomach is designed with its softness in mind.Choice E is not correct because the rib is a bony structure.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Bonus\nPlease see the [bonus instructions](inst/bonusInst.md) for more information on the bonus question. ___", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "fly', does not make sense as this statement is both grammatically incorrect and has no relevance to the question at hand.\n5. Choices C & D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', don't make sense because while these emotions may occur in response to something, they are not causes of a possible issue or obstacle in someone. \n6. Therefore, the remaining choices are A, 'injuries', and E, 'energy', but E, 'energy', while relevant to performance arts, is not relevant to this question as performing does not exhaust energy; on the contrary, it requires energy and enthusiasm in the performance. \n7. Thus, it can be concluded that the answer is A, 'injures'.\nAnswer: A: injures\n\nInput: What would you do if you wanted to go fishing? Choices:  C: call a doctor, the fish will need a cast E: go out and fish H: go back to fishing D: wait till it gets better B: you wouldn't be able to fish\nRationales: We need to decide what would be done if the fish is injured, and therefore cannot be fished. The three most likely responses you would receive if you said that you would be unable to fish are: 1) I would wait until it got better. 2) You won't be able to go fishing. 3) Why would you be able to fish? Only Options D and B make these statements. Thus, it can reasonably be concluded that D is the best response.\nAnswer: D, Wait until it gets better\n\nInput: Someone who is in an art class is required to do what? Choices: C: go to the dentist E: read books D: go to the movies H: practice painting\nRationales: Reading books isn't usually required for a class.

(H) Practice Painting\nAnswer: H, Practice Painting", "answer": " 37"}
{"text": "fliess', doesn't make sense. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is also a choice that doesn't make sense because it doesn't directly follow from the fact that the person is a talent. They could be happy without being talented or talented without being happy, so this doesn't fully support their identity as a talent.\n6. Choices B and D don't make sense with the context of the question, so we can narrow down our choices further. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\" might seem right at first glance as an anxiety could possibly cause their reservations, however anxiety could be about performing a talent that doesn't really exist. The question clearly states they do have a talent, and that they aren't comfortable performing. If they were unable to perform in the first place, then there wouldn't be anything to perform. \n8. Therefore, Choice C, \"Anxiety\", is wrong.\n9. Choice A, \"injury\", doesn't match either as it isn't an implication of this question that an injury would be a source of their lack of ability to perform. \n10. This leaves us with Choice E, \"energetic\", as it doesn't conflict with the other choices we've ruled out and describes someone who is easily motivated to do something.\n11. Thus, the answer is Choice E: energetic. \nAnswer: E: energetic \n\nInput: The answer to the equation 6(85% of) - 7 is: Choices:  A; 60 B; 71 C; 51 D; -155 E; 51\nRationales: First, let's break down the formula we are given. We have the formula, 6(85%) - 7. This tells us that we have 85% of an amount multiplied by 6 (a number) minus 7. \nNow, looking at the choices, we see that Choices A, B, and C are all incorrect. These choices are less than what we were given. \nThus, it makes sense that the answer would be Choice D, \"\u2212155\". \nAnswer: D: -155 \n\nSample: If you have", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "lies', is an awkward, indirect option that doesn't really say anything. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness,\" suggests that happiness is the person's main barrier because they are happy. \n6. With this in mind, we know that happiness isn't enough of a reason to hinder someone's performance, so this isn't a solid contender. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety,\" fits the best because a fear of failing would be the kind of anxiety that might cause someone to not be able to perform in public. \n8. Therefore, we narrow our options down to Choice B, \"anxiety\". The answer is E: anxiety\n\nInput: What are the primary purposes of an academic paper? Choices:  a) to provide a summary b) to share ideas c) to summarize d) to convince readers e) to help you learn\nRationales:  1. We can see that the primary purpose of an academic paper is to provide a brief overview of the author's ideas and findings.\n2. Looking at each choice individually, we can eliminate unnecessary information: choice A: \"to provide a summary\" doesn't say much more than what we already know from the prompt, and it doesn't make sense as an option in a question that is asking what the primary purposes of an article are; choice C: \"to summarize\" seems too specific for an academic paper; choice D: \"to convince readers\" doesn't make sense within the prompt, as it doesn't imply a negative judgment toward what the author is summarizing, just that the author has researched their material thoroughly.\n3. After we remove those unnecessary options, we are left with Choice B: \"to share ideas,\" the best fitting answer.\nAnswer: Choice E: to help you learn.\n\nInput: Why did the man in the wheelchair run to the corner of the street?

{"text": "fly', does not align with the question as it does not describe someone who is not a talent person, but someone who is but cannot perform.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', are related to feelings, which do not align with the question.\n6. Finally, 'energetic' does make sense as it involves being excited about doing a task. \n7. To summarize, the question is asking about a certain psychological disposition \u2013 that someone would likely not like performing because they are 'energetic'. \n8. Therefore, we can safely deduce that choice E, 'energetic', is the right answer.\nAnswer: E'energetic'\n\nInput: What do you call a place that is open air? Choices: 1. Gymnasium 2. Concert hall 3. Stadium 4. Theater or 5. Auditorium\nRationales:1. The question is about a place that is open, and therefore does not consider a 'closed space'. As such, we can eliminate choice 1, gymnasium.\n2. Choice 2, concert hall, refers to a place dedicated to musical performances. However, it's not always outdoors.\n3. Choices 3 and 4, baseball stadium and basketball court, are not referred to as 'open air places'.\n4. So, choice 5, auditorium, is left. The auditorium does refer to an 'indoor space' and is therefore not 'open air' as required by our question.\n5. And so, choice 1, concert hall, is the final answer.\nAnswer: 3.

Choices: \nA: hard work B: to have no idea\nC: not to have too many choices D: to think about it at all E: to just try it\nRationales:\n1. The question is describing what a person can do to have a successful business.\n2. Choice \"A\" is the least relevant to the question as it isn't about starting a business but, about working hard and maintaining your business. \n3. Since the question mentions starting a business, we should focus on which business starts should have no idea about.\n4. \"B\" isn't correct as having no idea is related to what you can do while starting the business. \n5. \"D\" is irrelevant as it talks about choosing the wrong product in a store to buy, that is, it is about buying a product after having tried it.\n6. \"C\" can eliminate the options to have choice in which business to start. So, it can't be the correct answer.\n7.

{"text": "fly'. This is a confusing statement that includes two things they cannot both suffer from and a butterfly is not a psychological reaction. So, we can eliminate this choice. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\u201d, does not match our criteria of someone suffering if they lack joy, nor does it seem feasible for a person to be both suffering and happy. However, it makes us think that the person in question isn't experiencing unhappiness or lacking enjoyment from performing, so this is ruled out. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\". We can eliminate this choice by thinking what would cause someone to suffer for something they have a talent for. \n7. Option E, \"energetic\" has a feeling similar to excitement, which is not listed as a negative thing about performing in the question. \n8. Therefore, from the available choices, the most feasible answer seems to be Choice B, 'anxiety' as it is a common feeling related to performing, and can be considered the most fitting answer. \nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: A gymnast's uniform, and another of their athletic related attire are what? Choices: A: pants and shirt B: leotards and skorts C: leotards and pants D: shorts and pants E: shorts and skirt\nRationales: The question asks about what a gymnast's athletic related attire might entail - essentially asking about the dress code for this sport. We know a gymnast' logic - they need to focus on their movements and the right attire gives them the opportunity to do so - should assist in deciding which of the answer options is the correct one. \n1. Leotards and pants is one possibility in general attire, but a gymnast wears leotards (rather than pants/shorts) to allow for freedom of movement and to avoid distracting or hindering their performance. \n2. Leotards and skort, however, is not only the traditional gymnastics uniform, but the only possible option considering that it is the only combination of clothing items that is allowed in this particular sport. \n3. Conclusively, Choice D, \"shorts and pants\" is the only reasonable response among the options available.", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "flys', is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", is also incorrect as this refers to a positive force or quality rather than a physical reservation about performing.\n6. Now, looking at the choices that seem fitting - \"happiness\" and \"anxiety\" - we eliminate the options that make the claim too general. Considering someone that is not happy or not in an anxiety state when performing does not exactly rule out the possibility of them being talented. \n7. So, we're left with anxiety and happiness as potentially relevant possibilities. \n8. As the person may have anxiety before performing, their anxiety is most relevant, meaning the best option is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D- anxiety\n\nInput: My family were going to have a large party, so what happened? Choices: 1. A: I was sick 2. B: I was very tired C. I did not wanted to attend event 3. D: the party were canceled E. my family did not had the possibility to have the party\nRationales: The question asked about the event at which the whole family is to attend.\n1. The first option is not valid because the whole family is attending the event. 2. Second option is wrong because the second option does not give any context to the party. 3. It is also not applicable because the family will attend the party only. 4. Option E is also incorrect because the family did not attend. 5.

Options that don't fit include \"ignore\" and \"hug\" because these don't seem relevant to the situation described and would likely not be chosen by someone who is angry.\n\n3. Options that don' have enough information to describe what might happen are \"kill\" and \"do\".\n\n4. Therefore, the options that appear most likely to be chosen are \"punch\" and \"kill\".\n\n5.

Choice D, happiness, does not go with 'their suffer' and is not relevant in the context of a disliking in performing. \n6. Choice C contains an antonym for 'talent', making it inaccurate. \n7. Choice E does make sense, 'energetic', but it also does not fit well with the question.\n8. The key thing to look out for is the context of the question, to determine the nature of the disinterest in performing. \n9. Since the question refers to 'their' talent it is possible to deduce the disinterest does not relate to shyness or reluctance to perform. \n10. The disinterest is probably in performing itself.\n11. The only choice that fits is Choice E, 'energetic'.\nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 300"}
{"text": "fly', isn't an invalid argument as the question doesn't ask about any correlation between injury and butterfly. Moreover, 'butterfly' does not match the context of the question, so it doesn't make sense. Thus, we can dismiss this choice.\n5. Choices C and D have no information available about what the person is suffering from, and Choice E does not make sense as the person's inability to perform wouldn't be a result of being energetic.\n6. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E, so the answer is Choice C, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: You think your friend may steal your credit card information, what should you do to be safe when shopping online?

{"text": "fly'. Butterflies here is a simile used to describe a feeling of nervousness or anxiety, a feeling relevant to our question. \n5. Choice B does not give a good fit with our question or the answers provided. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is a feeling described by Choice B that is relevant to a performance. There is also mention of a person not experiencing this feeling. \n7. However, 'happiness' is the opposite of anxiety. Choice E, energy, would be the only appropriate choice. \n8. Choices B, C, and D don't mention anxiety or butterflies, but they are not relevant to our question.\n9. Therefore the answer is E, energy.\nAnswer: E, energy\n\nInput: Sheila had a lot of things to do today so when she left school, what would she normally do next? Choices:  D: go shopping B: spend time with her mom C: take selfies E: go home\nRationales:  1. The question is looking for the normal next step for Sheila when she leaves school.\n2. Considering what we're looking for - a normal next step - we can start to eliminate out of place options. \n3. We can also rule out answers with an out-of-scope context. \n4. First is Choice A, 'go shopping'. As soon as school is done in the afternoon, not only is Sheila likely not to be shopping but also would be a strange thing to be doing. \n5. We can eliminate Choice B as well. Sheila presumably wants to get home as soon as possible. If she wanted to go home, then she would simply stay in school, as leaving is often seen as too late.\n6. Choices C and E are things she definitely wouldn't do next as a normal next step.\n7. The last choice that works is B, in other words,'spend time with her mom.' \n8. Even if it wasn't a normal next step, this was something she would still do.\n9. Therefore \"Take selfies\" is the correct Answer.\nAnswer: A, taking selfies\n\nInput: What type of tree drops the most fruit in the fall? Choices:  B: apple C: orange D:", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "fly', is a non-sequitur, as it doesn't provide any reasoning to support the claim.  \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", is irrelevant to the initial question as it doesn't answer the specific question.\n6. Choices C, \"anxiety\", and B, \"talent persons cannot suffer a heart attack and butterflies\", refer to mental states, suggesting that anxiety or a heart attack would likely be a reason someone doesn't enjoy performing.\n7.

Choices: 1: The scientist was excited to be on his boat because of the beautiful weather. 2: That guy smells good. 3: Ms. Horton was so funny. 4: His friend said. 5: The team's coach was happy with their last match.\nRationales: This question is testing comprehension, not grammar knowledge.\n1. Given the options, we can identify which ones are complete sentences and which are not complete. \n2. First, we can start by eliminating the sentence that's very clearly incomplete, 5: \"The team's coach was  happy with their last match.\" We know these are sentences because each contains a capital letter and a period, but they lack the subject and predicate of sentences. Therefore, it's the last complete sentence.\n3. Next we know to look at whether sentence 4 is complete as it's the one that's ambiguous. \n4. The sentence is actually correct in how it's written. We could replace \"that guy\" with \"he\" to make the sentence more clear and identify the subject of the sentence. So, sentence four is a complete sentence, thus eliminating it from the list. \n5. Now, all of the remaining sentences can potentially be considered complete, so we need to identify the ones that truly are. \n6. We know that 1, 2, and 3 are complete because each contains a subject and predicate (two or more words that can be found in the sentence and can explain what the subject is doing, feeling, or thinking) separated by a verb (two or more words indicating an action, state or possession, or quality). If we rewrite these sentences", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "fly', is grammatically incorrect and does not make sense. \n5. Choice D, while an adjective describing happiness, still doesn't make sense in the context of the question, in which it describes someone who may be suffering from anxiety and lack of confidence.\n6. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energy', do not make sense as they do not describe psychological reservations about performing.\n7. Therefore it is reasonable to eliminate choices A-E, and narrow down the choices to Choices B and C. 8. Choice B and C both describe mental states, however, Choice B, being anxiety, refers back to an internal mental state concerning a performance, while Choice C refers to a more external state concerning their environment. \n9. Therefore, we can infer that Choice C is more likely, as the question implies that the person in question will be affected by reservations about their performance in some way, and that choice C seems to fit this context. 10. Therefore, the best option is Choice C, as it provides more specific details.\nAnswer: C. Choice B and Choice C are possible.\n\nInput: Why do people like to buy and sell diamonds? Choices:  a. They like to buy diamonds and sell them for a profit b. They like to buy cheap diamonds c. They like to sell their diamonds back to the jeweler d.

They are willing to sell their diamonds, but they do not like their buyers. They keep saying that it is because diamonds are not very profitable.  \n2. They want to sell their diamonds and buy other diamonds at a low cost to make more profit.  \n3.

{"text": "fliess', refers to a specific type of performance art and doesn't encompass the broad idea of a performance art. \n5. Choice D, an incorrect grammar structure (e.g. happiness but happiness energy).\n6. The last two choices are plausible options, referring to a type of anxiety or a positive emotion. \n7. However, we can eliminate these options as well. \n8. 'Insomnia' is a type of anxiety, but it doesn't relate to performing. \n9. 'Energetic' is a positive emotion, but it's too specific to indicate the issue here. \n10. Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate them because none of them indicates what type of anxiety or positive emotion would cause one to refuse to perform in spite of their talent.\n11. 'Anxiety' does make sense as the appropriate term to describe one's anxiety about performing, and it does not relate to the talent aspect, so it is a likely candidate.\n12. Looking at the first and last letters of the four-letter option words, we can see how 'Anxiety' would be the answer that best fits as an acronym of the given answer choices.\n13.

{"text": "fly's', does not make sense as it suggests a person suffering from both injuries and butterflies. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness,\" does not mean lack of happiness, it implies to have joy and positivity in one's life. \n6. As \"happiness\" is not what's being asked for. \n7. Choice E is unnecessary, as it merely offers 'energetic,' which is already included in the question phrase. \n8. So, we're left with A and C.\n9. Choice A is not the right answer, as the implication is the person is being made fun of for their talent. So, they don't enjoy it, but others enjoy observing it.\n10. Considering C choice, 'anxiety,' makes more sense. It can be related to the question wording. \n11. The person may have a talent, such as singing, but feels anxious when performing as a result of their past experiences. \n12. Therefore, the answer would be Choice C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: B: Anxiety\n\n###", "answer": " 300"}
{"text": "fly', is too descriptive and not the answer to our question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit as this would mean that the person enjoys performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is too vague and could fit several different people, so it's not a good option. \n7. Choice E, energetic. is also vague in nature and not specific to our question. 8. Therefore, the only answer choice that remains valid as it relates specifically to someone not enjoying performing out of fear of anxiety or embarrassment etc. is Choice B., anxiety.\nAnswer: B: Anxiety", "answer": " 584"}
{"text": "flys', is likely to be incorrect as it sounds like multiple phrases put together. \n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', are emotional states often caused by performing and can relate to the anxiety of performing or the eureka moment of a successful performance. However, both are more likely the outcomes of a performance rather than the deterrents from performances, so they don't make sense in the context.\n6. Choices E, 'energetic', and B, 'energetic and butterflys' are more ambiguous. We don't know for sure what energetic in this case would mean. \n7. We also can't say with certainty if the butterflys is either a typo or referring to the nerves associated with performing. It's unclear. \n8. Let's start by eliminating the choices that are contradictory to what we know about the question, starting with choice C: anxiety. \n9. We then consider choice B: energetic. \n10. Let's read it again and see if the 'and' that follows is ambiguous or is clear as to whether the butterflys are the performance or are a part of the performance. Reading it as a part of the performance, 'energetic butterflys' makes sense as being an outcome of performing, not a reason to avoid performing. \n11. Therefore, the best choice is B: energetic, and it's probably 'energetic and (performance) butterflys'. \n12. Alternatively, if it's 'and', it could refer to the energetic environment of the audience, so 'energetic and audience butterflys' has to be considered.\n13. However, the audience might be energetic about the performance as a whole experience, not just about a part of the performance or a single moment within it, so it could also be 'energetic and the experience butterflys'.\n14. Both these choices are also too vague and not direct enough, as it is not enough to just say the person suffers from 'energetic but butterflys' or 'energetic and experience butterflys'\n15. So, by eliminating all other choices, we get to choice", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "flis', is also incorrect because 'talent persons' refers to a person who can perform well. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not describe a feeling that prevents a person from performing, so that could be removed. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, means 'feeling uneasy, worried, or nervous before something difficult or unpleasant is likely to happen'. Therefore, an artist who suffers from anxiety would not likely perform well. \n7. All that is left are Choices C (anxiety) and E (energetic), the latter of which suggests a person is unreservedly positive and enthusiastic, while the former refers to a person being uneasy before performing.\n8. Thus, the correct answer has to be Choice C, 'anxiety', as it is the feeling more likely to prevent the person from performing. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: According to history, when a person was accused of a crime that could lead to execution, they were tried _______. Choices:  A. with an army B. with witnesses C. with the crown D. before being placed on trial E. by the person that was accused\nRationales: A) A common phrase is tried with an army. However, the context of the question suggests the person is already on trial. Thus, we can rule out choice A. \nB) In the context of the question, we are looking for someone with authority to have power over the outcome of the trial or execution. So, we can cross out choices B) and C). \nC) Try _______ before being placed on trial. The context of the question says that witnesses would already have been called to the stand and to be found as guilty or acquitted, thus eliminating choice C. \nD) Try _______ with the crown. The context says that the person who is being tried is already executed - the opposite of being able to try someone. Thus, we can consider eliminating choice D). \nE) Try _______ by the person that is accused. In the context of the sentence, it states what the accused would have, suggesting the trial takes place, thus eliminating choice E.\nAnswer: E. try by the person that was acccused.\n\n### Input: Where does science begin?

Choices:  A. immigrant B. traveler C. person of color D. nomad E. explorer\nRationales: Choice is B: A immigrant, B traveler, C person of color, D nomad, E explorer. \n1. Immigrant is the right answer: a) Immigrant is a traveler. b) No other option is a traveler. In reality in most cases, immigrants travel.\n2. The sentence is not: \"A immigrant, B: traveler, etc\" (that type of sentence does not exist in GMAT, if there are A, B, C, etc. choose the main and more important option).\n3. Immigrants are people who travel, they are most likely travelers, therefore, B: traveler is the right answer.\n4.

A person of color is a person who traveled to another country and is color that that they are not here.\n7. B: traveler is a better answer because it relates to the type of movement.\n8.

{"text": "fly', is a long-winded phrasing that doesn't give us a helpful answer. The phrase 'talent persons' may be a common saying, but this isn't the question context. Additionally, it is confusing as there are no known physical injuries that cause a person to suffer from 'butterfly'.\n5. The choice C, 'anxiety', is a logical possibility here, as the person may be nervous about getting on stage and their nerves may affect their performance. However, the person may also enjoy performing, they could simply be anxious because of other factors such as a fear of failure, which is related to more of a mental challenge rather than a physical or emotional one. \n6. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense because happiness implies enjoyment, whereas we know that the person does not enjoy performing.\n7. Choices E, 'energetic', is incorrect because this word refers to energy (stored in batteries) and enthusiasm. However, we don't refer to such physical resources as 'butterfly'. Hence, choice E, 'energetically', doesn't make sense here.\n8. Thus, we are left with two choices that remain uneliminated: 'anxiety' and 'not enjoy performing'.\n9. Comparing the two, we can eliminate choice C, 'anxiate' since it is a repetition of the root word.\n10. Therefore, we can deduce that the best answer is choice B, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: She needs an excuse for her absence, so she decides to make one up. However, she isn't too great at making up lies. She needed what to aid her in this task?

Some choices are given as eliminated. First, the options of art talents and honesty must remain as she needs to be creative with what she says so as to not be detected by people. She could not have used art talents or honesty to make up an excuse as she doesn't believe in using such talents to deceive people.", "answer": " 1700"}

Choice D, ''happiness', doesn't match the question either, as the subject feels more uncomfortable than happy. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", however, does fit the subject feeling more nervous than happy.\n7.

The question states which of the given statements about a job are not typical or important. These statements are: Requires travel, higher pay, good working environment, open to remote work, job stability.\n\n3. As these aren't typical or important, it makes sense to choose the statement that is.\n\n4.

Choice C, \"anxiety\" and \"energetic\" describe a type of reaction that is experienced by many people, not just people with performance-related reservations, and do have clear relevance. That leaves Choice E, \"a butterfly\" as the only viable choice.\n7. In fact, it's a clear choice as a butterfly is a metaphor for nervousness, but only a metaphor - and even then, it's just a figurative butterfly, not a literal one. \n8.

{"text": "fliess', is obviously wrong as the question relates to an individual's emotional state, not a specific instance of injury or butterflies. \n5.

However, that choice sounds too generic to be a correct response. \n7. Choice E, energetic, sounds like it may be relevant to this question, but we should consider how this pertains to performing arts and see if that is the case. \n8. While it does not matter whether the person is energetic at the time of performing, it does matter whether that energetic person enjoys what they are performing. \n9. Therefore, choice C, 'anxiety', is what the question may be looking for. \n10. While this may sound contradictory in itself, anxiety can make it difficult for someone to be energetic or happy. \n11.

However, to solve this question, you first need to understand that vegetarian animals must be herbivorous, which means they only eat plants, such as grass. This does not mean that all plants-eating animals are vegetarians. For example, bears are not vegetarian because they eat insects, carrion, fish, and honey. They also consume seeds in their diets.

So, it's time to focus in on what's left. \n7. Choice C, anxiety, is a common feeling people have when they are not at ease to perform. It's therefore plausible as an answer, but this doesn't completely remove it from consideration. That's because the \"they probably\" suggests that anxiety is likely to occur.

Choice 3 would conflict with choice 1, which refers to healthy food, and choice 2, which refers to physical exercise.

Choice D, \"happiness\", may seem like what this person feels, but it doesn't address the specific point \u2013 namely, concern about performing. \n7.

E: I'll keep an EYE on him! \nRationales: The question is making us think about the passengers with a suspicious car at a very late hour. \nOption B, 'Not suspicious', is not an option. \nIt isn't right because we were at a very late hour at the airport. \nOptions D, 'Stranger', E, 'Eye on him', A,'suspicious', and C, 'Crazy person', can all be true. \nAnswer: A: Suspicious", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "flights' could be interpreted as a statement that is either factually incorrect or vague, in relation to its context.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness' respectively, refer to mental states, but these mental states would not necessarily explain why someone may not like to perform. \n6. Choice B, as mentioned, is similarly factually erroneous or vague. \n7. As such, Choices E and C, 'energy' and 'butterflies', respectively, remain possible explanations for not wanting to perform when one possesses a talent.\n8. Looking at these options, it could be deduced that the person may be anxious about how well they will do during their performance or they feel a burst of energy before a performance.\n9. However, the person may have a talent, but still not feel energy, such as when they are nervous, as illustrated by Choice D.\n10. Therefore, while it is not immediately clear what the true explanation for this might be, it seems that Choice D, anxiety, may be the appropriate choice. \n11. Anxiety is typically referred to as a disorder caused by an intense and persistent worry that interferes with daily activities. This means that the person would feel anxiety regularly when not performing and not just during the act of performance.\n12. Therefore, by carefully removing all the less appropriate possibilities, the best fit is Choice D.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: I wanted to look for flowers so I found a florist at which location?

'A: Poochoo' is not a correct answer because it does not make any sense that a girl would name her pet bird 'Poochoo'\n\n1. 'B: Puttup' is not a correct option because 'puttup' is the same as 'cockadoodledoo'.\n\n1. 'C: Fupup' is too vague an answer and doesn't make much sense so it is not the answer.\n\n1. 'D: Eepup' is not correct because it does not make sense.\n\n1.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as a single person cannot'suffer' from a physical injury and a mental anxiety at the same time, which makes 'anxiety' a potential answer. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense either as this is not a concern of performing artists who don't wish to perform. \n6. 'Not enjoying a situation' is still valid, thus making 'not suffering from an enjoying performing' also a logical choice. \n7. 'Energetic' is an unrelated category, not even related to talent and performance. \n8. However, 'anxiety' is likely to be a valid choice as anxiety can also be a psychological block regarding the performance.\n9. Therefore the best answer is option C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C.

Choices: A: trail B: mountains C: river D: the beach\nRationales: Choice A, 'trail', refers to a path or track, typically used for hiking. A 'trail' is not often associated with getting away, suggesting a different answer choice. \nChoice B,'mountains', is also not an appropriate answer. A mountain is not typically associated with a hike. \nChoice D, 'the beach', is a type of terrain that would not be conducive for hiking as is typically done on a trail.\nChoice C, \u2018river\u2019 is also not an appropriate choice as rivers typically lead to water which would likely not be conducive to hiking.\nThe correct answer choice must be some location or terrain that could be hiked through and could afford a person enough distance to be able to get away from where they currently are. \nTherefore, the answer is, by process of elimination, choice D: the beach.\n\nAnswer: Choice D: the beach. \n\nInput: A wolfdog or any dog has what breed can be mixed?

Choices:  B: I made the decision to do nothing A: didn't cause any harm C: accidentally caused a fire D: didn't bother me due to the candles E: nothing happened\nRationales: Choice options: 1. The given scenario:  \"I tried to do nothing at the party, but the cakes didn't help when I fell over\"\n2. In the situation, we do not have freedom to choose our behavior. \n3. Since the question is about freedom of decision, the question wants to know what freedom of decision I will likely have in such a scenario. \n4.

Consider the choices:  A) \"I made the decision to do\" anything, but in the given scenario, we do not have the freedom to choose our behaviors. \n6. Considering option B) \"didn't cause any harm, any\" decision, if there is a cake on the table and there is a candle that falls over, the candle is likely to cause harm to the food or injury if the cake is on the floor, or even to people nearby. \n7.

{"text": "lies', is a flawed logic as it doesn't state why talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety; it is simply stating that they cannot. \n5.

Choices B and D don't seem plausible options, and so, we're left with two: C or E.\n7. Option C, 'anxiety' seems most plausible given that anxiety pertains to the psychological state, and what we are seeking from a person who possesses talent to perform is their psychological mindset. \n8.

Answer O is too vague, as it does not answer the question as'safest', rather it refers to 'place A and B'.\n4. Answer A is too broad, as the question refers specifically to location, which would imply something more narrow than this.\n5. Answer C is also unclear. \n6. Choice D is specific enough to answer the question, as 'location B' would be considered the safest place to'stop' because it is not within location A, which is a'safest place' according to the given information.\n7.

{"text": "flys', appears contradictory. \n5. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019, doesn\u2019t fit in the context of the sentence since the context implies that the person being described does not feel confident when performing, which is the exact opposite of energetic.\n6. The remaining choices, \u201canxiety\u201d and \u201chappiness,\u201d provide possible explanations. \n7. Thus, the choices seem to be a psychological condition of either anxiety or happiness. \n8. When a person is not feeling confident about their performance, they might be experiencing anxiety.\n9. Thus, as we try to find a phrase that means 'not enjoying', 'anxiety' is the best choice as the meaning of anxiety involves feeling worried or uneasy, which doesn't fit the person's situation if they are good at performing. \n10.

Choices B and D are also irrelevant, as they don't relate to this specific context.\n7. Choices C and E indicate concerns over anxiety and happiness, but these are general emotional states that wouldn't necessarily apply to the context, unless there is something significant suggesting such a response.\n8.

The first paragraph in the first sentence is: \"During the first day of school you will meet classmats and discover how to get along\". Thus, you can expect to learn how to get along. It's probably what you'll learn most on the first day of school.\n3. Choices A and D are not relevant because A is not what you discover, but what you meet.

Looking at our choices there are some irrelevant options to discount:\n3. Choice C, \"shadows', doesn't make sense here as shadows have no physical relevance to the sun.\n4. Choices D and E, \"Night\" and \"clouds\", are also not relevant since they don't have anything to do with the sun. They are only things that can block the sun.\n5. In this context, we can narrow our options down to only four choices, since B and C are the only two choices that could potentially be the correct answer.\n6. Choices B and C are then narrowed because we know sunset is not caused by light, and light is not an object. We can then eliminate Choice C by elimination since we have already eliminated Choices D and E. \n7.

So, 'injury+butterfly' does not make sense with the question as it is trying to find what the'suffer from' phrase is referring to. Butterflies and injuries are unrelated. \n6. Therefore, we can eliminate it. \n7. Choice C, however, makes sense. Anxiety is a psychological condition, and it is related to feeling nervous and nervousness is associated with performing.\n8. Furthermore, choice C indicates that a 'person' is the subject, not an injury, indicating the question is talking about talented performance artists, who can suffer from anxiety.\n9.

Choices:  I: floating, on a log  II: walking on water, swimming  III: eating the river  IV: riding in the canoe, in a canoe\nRationales: This question asks how a tree was traveling to indicate a difference between transportation methods.\n1. \"The [flower] was in a bucket\" implies the flower was not riding in the cano, meaning choice I could not be an option.

What was the patient's blood culture result? Choices: \n* A: Negative\n* B: Positive\n* C: Slow growth\n* D: Intermediate growth\n* E: Poor growth\nRationales:\n\n1. The question states that the patient's blood pressure is 150/25.\n\n2. We know that this represents high blood pressure.\n\n3. We also know that the patient has a  PTT 21.\n\n4. This means that the patient is anemic.\n\n5. We know that this patient has eosinophils, but they are too small to see.\n\n6. The doctor's conclusion is that this patient is a hemophiliac, meaning that they are at risk for bleeding.\n\n7. However, we know from the other answers that the patient is not bleeding.\n\n8. Therefore, we can deduce that the patient has an infection and that the blood culture is positive.\n\n9. Therefore, we can choose B, \"Positive\".\n\nAnswer: B. \"Positive\"\n\nInput: After a storm that resulted in a major power outage, what can be expected from the electrical grid", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "fly', refers to a phrase that does not fit the criteria of the person. The context does not describe or imply a person who suffers from injury and butterly.\n5.

Choices: A: the school they go to B: the teachers they have C: the students' laziness D: their learning disability E: how much they study\nRationales: The question is asking what causes many students to have reading and solving algebra problems.\n1. One can assume that if there is a problem with reading algebra, the problem is most likely reading and doing algebra problems, especially if the problems are algebra. These options provide the answer, either by saying that the problem is caused by the school (A, B) or lazy students (C), but neither is correct.\n2. Choice D states that students who have problems are not lazy (but rather hard-working students) and does not imply that there is an issue with their reading ability.\n3. Choices A, C, and E do not provide a credible explanation for the reading capabilities of students since these types of schools, students, and the amount of time spent studying do not imply an issue with reading.\n4. Therefore, the best option is E, meaning that the only option left is choice E: the amount of time spent by the students studying.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: A large crowd has gathered to see a famous singer, can you tell what they really want to see by looking at their behaviour?

{"text": "fly', is a logical fallacy. Even if it is true (if it is not) that a group of talent persons cannot have these conditions, that answer is irrelevant as it doesn't answer the question. \n5. Eliminating B as a possible answer leaves us with Choices C, D and E. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, would be a reasonable answer if this question stated the person suffering from anxiety. However, it doesn't. As such, that option must be eliminated too. \n7. As the question has also eliminated Choice E, which states that the individual is energetic, it is safe to say that the answer most likely relates to the feelings that go into performing. \n8. Choice D, anxiety, is the most relevant choice. Even though Choice C, anxieties could be about the performance, anxieties by itself are not exclusively feelings about performing due to nerves. Thus Choice C would be a better option if the question also had an answer that specifically related to nerves, which it does not.\n9.

Choice C could also be written with a possessive noun, for example, 'can't suffer from anxiety', as that wouldn't make grammatical sense.\n9. Choice D, \"happiness,\" doesn't fit because people can be talent but not happy all the time when performing.\n10.

{"text": "fly', is a grammatically incorrect argument, which means that it is likely to be irrelevant to the rest of the question. \n5. Choice B says that talent persons suffer from injury but not butterflies.\n6. Choices A and B are irrelevant to the main point of the question, which is about psychological or psychiatric concerns rather than physical concerns, such as injuries. \n7. Choice C, \"Anxiety' is a common mental health concern, which a person could suffer from without performing on a stage.\n8. Choice D, Happiness is not directly related to performing because a person can be happy and still not enjoy performing. 9.

Choice D, happiness, has no logical link to someone 'not liking to perform'.\n9. Choice E, energetic, may seem to fit, but the question specifically asks the performer lacks energy.\n10.

Choices: \nA, pigment\nB, plastic\nC, paint and brush\nD, plastics\nE, paint\nRationales: As the question asks for the primary elements of most paintings, we can eliminate outliers. \n1. First choice, \"pigment\" would be an outlier, as pigment is a common ingredient of paints.\n2. Second choice, \"plastics\" is also an outlier. Plastics are typically material used in the manufacture of paints, not their constituent elements.\n3. Third choice, \"paint and brush\", is also an outlier, as paints are normally bought as a ready-made product, not as a combination of paint and brush.\n4. Leaving only the remaining answers as options. \n5. As \"paint\" is the primary ingredient in paintings, it is a sensible candidate as the answer choice for the primary elements that make most paintings. \n6.

Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', do not necessarily refer to the inability to perform, and Choice E, 'energetic', seems too general to be an answer for the question.\n6. In looking at what would be a plausible explanation for an aversion towards performing, Choice B, 'anxiety', seems to cover this, given that it refers to fear and stress.\n7.

The question asks about the job of that person, based on the statement that they have an excellent voice. \n2. The statement about his excellent voice means that this will apply to his singing talent.\n3. In looking at choices A, B, C, D, and E, Choices A and D are impossible because harmonica and singing are separate art forms.\n4. Choices B, C, and E are also excluded because veterinary medicine and singing are different fields.\n5.

The only choice that could make a person not enjoy performing despite having a talent would be choice E \"Energetic\" as energetic people may often have an overbearing or aggressive attitude that can come across as negative or intimidating; this could cause the performer to dislike performing.\n8.

Choice B: \"report incident\" is the correct answer. The first step would be reading the mail, then reporting to management any incident. This would then warrant a reset or change to be made.\n3. Choices D and E: \"log system incident\" and \"reset system\" are too specific to be correct answers as there could be many reasons why a system may need a reset to function again.\n4. Choices A and C: are too general and implausible. The general \"change something in a system\", or a more vague \"report a change to the system\" do not make sense.\n5.

{"text": "fly', is not relevant to the question either as it is related to nervousness of presenting in front of a crowd, which may not be relevant to the context as the performance may be prerecorded. \n5. Choice E, happiness, is irrelevant as the individual is not expressing happiness with their circumstance, but rather suffering through it.\n6. Looking at the remaining choices, we can start focusing our choice on Choice D. \n7. Choice E, anxiety, has a similar context to choosing Choice D, which is about performance issues causing suffering. \n8. Therefore, we can eliminate Choice B, 'butterfly' and Choice E, anxiet as they have similar meanings to Choice D. This leaves us to choose between Choice D, anxiety, and Choice D, anxiet as the first choice may be incorrect, so we can also eliminate Choice D, anxet.\n9.

Choices: \n A: accepts foreigners B: accepts graduates from certain high schools C: accepts graduates from high schools that offer bi-lingual education D: accepts no foreigners E: offers study abroad opportunities\nRationales: The question asks which university the student plans to attend.\n1.

Choice C, accepts graduates from high school that offer bi-lingue education, does not provide information whether or not the student is looking for a mono-lingual or bilingual university.\n3. Choices B, D and E are only options if the question is about whether the student has plans to attend university and, therefore, are irrelevant.\n4. Choices A, C and D only provide information if the student is looking for an English-speaking university. However, if the student wants to attend a non-English-speaking university, none of the given choices apply.\n5.

{"text": "fly', is not a logical statement, so we can eliminate this option and any others that might confuse themselves with the original premise.\n5. Similarly to choice B, Choice C, 'anxiety', also doesn't fit, as a person doesn't have to have a talent related to performing to feel anxiety. \n6. Choice D, \"happiness\", may feel relevant at first, but does not make sense as a reason not to perform - a talent need not be enjoyed to be useful, and choosing not to perform is not an inherent act of unhappiness.\n7.

{"text": "fly', is irrelevant because it does not describe the issue that this person has nor does it provide a solution or possible alternative. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense as \"the person probably... suffers from injury and butterflie\" could be applied to someone who suffers from a happy accident on stage. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\" is one possible explanation or reaction to \"suffering from injury butterflie\" because anxiety is a response to stress, which can be caused by performing. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't make any sense as the person isn't energetic if they don't like performing. \n8. Finally, choice D, \"talent\" is what will fit in terms of the question, but it doesn't provide a solution for the person because they don't like to perform.\n9.

Choice II doesn't tell you whether the answer is positive or negative.\n4. However, we don't know yet if the numbers will be positive or negative, so Choice II is a plausible answer\n5. Choice III is not a real number because no integer, let along any number, can form the first word of a sentence.\n6. Choices IV and V do not tell us which answer you would get when adding zero to a number.

Looking at D, 'talent persons can suffer from anxiety,' we know that a performance-based art like dancing is a talent. \n10. Looking at B, 'talentpersons cannot suffer from injury and anxiety', we know that an injury is a physical condition that talentpersons cannot suffer from. \n11.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense, as it is grammatically incorrect.\n5.

Rationales: 1)The Question asks us what the conductor told the group. After asking why the conductor would deny a request of an experienced group. 2) Looking at each Choice A \"The Conductor did not like the Order\" does not describe anything relating to the Question. Choice B \"More Rehearsal Time\" describes a situation that is similar to why the Conductor would deny a slow and soft performance, a conductor would normally deny a request to rehearse after the first meeting. Choice C \"A better Player could be hired to perform the Drum Solo.\" is similar to the question and why the conductor denied a slow and smooth performance. We know that a more experienced player should be able to play slow and soft. Choice D \"An Instrument was Broken\" is a different situation. The band is asking the conductor to rehearse and play slow and soft. We know that the Conductor is aware of the instrument's broken condition from the Question. Conclusion the group is asking to play slow and soft and it is normal for the conductor to turn them down. We know that this person knows that the drum solo is broken and does not deny that they need to play slow and soft, therefore Choice E \"The Conductor and the rest of band needed more practice\" is the Correct answer.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense, as 'butterflies' is not a specific condition. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't directly related to performing arts, so it can be eliminated \n6. Choice C, anxiety, and choice E, 'energetic,' both deal with mental states of mind, rather than performer status, so they can be eliminated. \n7. This leaves us with two likely choices - either a psychological condition like 'anxiety', or an unwillingness to perform.\n8. Since the person in question has the talent to perform as implied by their 'talent', we can eliminate choice D, 'anxiety,' since having a pre-show mental block can be overcome with preparation, practice, and experience. We can then narrow down the options to: A: talent person or B: person unwillingness to perform\n9.

This choice is the only remaining that aligns with the requirements of the question, and is the most relevant to a feeling of anxiety and related to performing. \n8.

Someone who enjoys performing would not be plagued with anxiety and would thus not suffer from it. Choice E, \"energetic\", does not make sense as it is not a psychological issue.\n8. Therefore the most likely answer is Choice C: anxiety. \nAnswer: A: injury\n\nInput: What makes a good student?\nA: studying B: working hard C: participating D: failing E: enjoying\nRationales:\n1. The question asks, about what makes a good student? \n2. We first need to differentiate between the characteristics of a good student and a bad one.\n3. In order for something to be considered a good quality, it must be present - not absent - so we can safely eliminate the negative choice, \"failing\".\n4. Choice D, \"failing\", does not make sense given we are asking what makes a good student as we do not want them to fail. \n5. Looking at Choices A, B, C and E, we can determine that they're all about characteristics that are beneficial to students - \"studying\", \"working hard\", \"participating\" and \"enjoying\".\n6. We can further narrow down our choices by observing that the question specifies students are \"good\", meaning we can assume these qualities must be present.\n7. Choices A and C describe qualities that are present - a good student studies and works hard. We can infer Choice B, \"participating\", is also present in a good student.\n8. Finally, we can determine that Choice E, \"enjoying\", might also be present in a good student, as they may enjoy learning and find the process of performing well rewarding.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: studying.\nAnswer: B: working hard\n\nInput: If a person wears a raincoat but can't walk, they probably suffer what? Choices:", "answer": " 10"}

This requires an understanding of how a cash register is secured from theft.\n\n1. Considering the given information, \"nothing\" is not an option.\n2. Choice B, \"cameras\", is a measure taken to prevent the theft of an object.\n3. Choices C and D, \"bulletproof glass\" and \"security officers\", refer to physical measures taken to prevent the thetheft. \"Alarms\" could be considered a physical security measure, but it also refers to a type of security that produces sound.\n4.

{"text": "fly' is incorrect grammar, as there is no direct subject-verb relationship. \n5. We know the answer is related to psychological issues as people with physical issues don't have similar reservations about performing.\n6. Looking at the choice D, 'happiness', we know that people who suffer from happiness are suffering from something else, as happiness is an emotion.\n7. Choices A and C, 'injury' and 'anxiety' are both considered anxiety-related, while choice B, 'talent person(s)', does not directly describe an emotion - just the plural of 'talent'.\n8. It thus seems that choice E, 'energetic', is the most likely answer.\n9. It makes sense as someone who is talented but doesn't like to perform may have energy to perform and enjoy performing, but they are not happy or anxious while they perform.\n10. They are still energetic, though.\n11. Therefore, the best choice is E: energetic.\nAnswer: E, energetic\n\nInput: The most useful thing in a classroom that can get more students to speak is usually what? Choices: A: an overhead projector B: computers C: the teacher D: a computer screen E: a white board\nRationales: The question is asking what the best tool in a classroom is to encourage students to speak. Choices B, C, D, and E are all valid options, and all are things that can be found in a classroom. Choice A, an overhead projector, is used in classrooms but primarily for the display of static content, such as slides or handouts. Choice A is only useful for presentations where students are given a handout to read and respond to questions orally. So, even though it could be helpful, it is not the best choice, as it doesn't help increase student speaking. Therefore, the best option is choice B: Computers are used in classrooms primarily as sources of information and entertainment, and some students also use computers to discuss topics with the teacher. Therefore, computers generally encourage students to speak; Choice C, the teacher, is often the person who asks questions in classrooms and generally motivates students to participate.

Choice D, however, is the exact opposite of such an emotion. One would not like performing if they enjoyed it, so it is the most direct choice and therefore the correct one.\n7.

Choices B and D are eliminated for that reason. \n7. Since Choice E, 'energetic', mentions a trait that is not directly related to being nervous while performing, it can be crossed off. \n8. If we look at the remaining choices, we can see that they all relate to one type of experience - being anxious or nervous about a performance, thus one of the choices must be 'anxiety'. \n9. From this we can eliminate choices C and E. Choice B is excluded because 'butterflies' refers to the feeling of butterflies in the stomach, which is not related to nervousness. \n10.

Choice A, 1/4, is the wrong answer because average speed is a calculation that uses units of time instead of units of division, and this answer is not defined as time. \n2. Choice B, 60, is the correct answer, because this is how far the train travels in one hour. \n3. The correct way to calculate average speed is the equation, (distance/time) and the question asks about the distance, not the time. \n4.

The question is about what type of animal cannot see clearly below or from behind itself.\n2. We don't know that the animal in question is smaller than another.\n3. Thus, option A doesn't make sense as it suggests that any smaller animal cannot see clearly below itself. Since no animal in that group can fit the description, this eliminates it. \n4. Similarly, option B doesn't make sense since it says no bigger animal can see clearly below itself. But no animal in that group would fit the description either, so it gets eliminated as well. \n5. Option C, on the other hand, makes sense as it indicates that only animals shorter than this animal can't see clearly behind itself. \n6. Option D seems obvious as there is no animal that is incapable of seeing clearly from behind itself. \n7.

Choice C, an anxiety disorder, is too broad to relate directly to performing arts. \n7. Choice E, an 'energetic' person, is a good trait to have but doesn't directly tie to a question about performing. What's more, the adjective, 'energetic', doesn't directly relate to a particular emotional state. \n8. Thus, the wording is slightly misleading, and we can rule out this answer too. \n9.

It is therefore reasonable, by removing the other choices and narrowing in on the choice that specifically mentions a psychological response, C, 'anxietiy', our answer for this question is C, option 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: Someone with a good singing voice is capable of being a what? Choices: a singer B: voice teacher C: musician D: musician/sportsman E: musician/voice teacher\nRationales: The question refers to someone with a good singing voice who has the potential to be a ___.\nLooking at the answer choices, a singer is clearly not what is sought, or a voice teacher, a musician, nor a musician/sportsmen. \nMusic teachers and sportsmans/women do not have a voice, so this rules them out. \nThe choices A and B have the same issue with sportsmen/women. \nThe remaining choice is C, a musician. \nAnswer C, musician, is the correct answer.

Choice D, happiness, is a positive feeling and does not indicate feeling of negativity in regards to performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is a psychological disorder experienced as an overwhelming or excessive feeling of worry or anxiety. It is an emotion related to performing and the general context of the question, suggesting it makes more sense.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is Choice B: \"Anxiety\".\nAnswer: A: Anxiety\n\nInput: A man lost his wallet containing his driver's license at his house. A. Where else besides his wallet could find his name and address? Choices:  B: telephone book C: grocery store D: library E: post office\nRationales:\n1. The question is saying that the man lost his wallet to which his driver's license is included and that his name and address can be found in his wallet.\n2. The man may have received the driver's license when he registered for a driving test so he will have to go to the government institution to get it back but this may take a pretty long time so the man can take an action much easier.\n3. Looking for clumps from a sentence, B and E are not likely to be the answer because these are institutions and not shops.\n4. To a shop that we can find the address and name, there is the library(A), telephone book(B) and post office(C).\n5. C is wrong because the library is a study place with limited books. You can get your library book and address through the card and it takes only a few minutes.\n6. B and E are not right, a telephone directory is likely the same size as the library and will not be easy for the person to search when there are many people going in and out.\n7. Therefore A is the choice.\n\nAnswer: A: library\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade question.\n\n## Demonstration: Input: Which is the most common type of virus that affects computers?

{"text": "fly', while it may make sense at first glance, is actually talking about two separate issues. It is true that injured persons cannot suffer from butterflies, but the person suffering from injury isn't necessarily the person suffering from butterflies. Therefore, the sentence does not provide much information for us to determine which issue has affected them. \n5. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019 seems like a plausible choice and may relate to the person in question. This can create a positive effect, though, as an individual may have confidence in performing a certain role but lack the energy to perform. \n6. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, may also be true, as being confident and having happiness both relate to performing well. Therefore, they can also both work as an excuse why they may not like performing. \n7. Finally, choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, may be correct, as this can potentially dampen confidence or enthusiasm in performing, though not necessarily the entirety of either. \n8. We can combine our current information to decide the best option. \n9. Choice B may mean that talent persons cannot be injured and still have butterflies in their stomach, so we can remove it from consideration. \n10. Choice C may mean that talent persons can struggle with anxiety in spite of their talent, though being unable to perform because of it. \n11. Choice D may mean that one can be very confident and enthusiastic but be very happy when performing, however this would not justify someone's performance anxiety. \n12. Choice E may mean that one is energetic but lacks the confidence to enjoy performance. \n13. Looking at the information we have, the best answer given the question is choice C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C.

{"text": "fly', does't fit as it is too vague and doesn't describe the phenomenon experienced by those with anxiety disorders. \n5. Choice D, being 'happy', isn't a problem, because if one likes performing then they can't suffer from anxiousness. \n6. Choice B, anxiety can refer to the feeling of apprehension, foreboding, dread, or uneasiness about what might happen. \n7. Thus, it makes sense that those with anxiety, especially those with social anxiety or performance anxiety, experience butterflies or any other form of nervousness that might manifest as physical symptoms.

Choices: 1. be worn a lot 2. be taken to the shop for repairing 3. be bought again in another color 4. be washed by me with the color still maintained 5. never be worn again\nRationales: Choice 1 A: be worn a lot B: be taken to the shop C: be bought again in another colour / colour D: be washed by me E: never be worn again\nNotes: 1. From the question itself, we can conclude that the answer to the question is a statement about how I react to my jeans. 2. There are also some hints provided by the question, suggesting that I am happy with the purchase and will continue to wear them. 3. We're given the choice between some statements about my jeans and some statements about me. We can eliminate the first three options, because they are not about me. 4. Eliminate D for the same reason. 5. Eliminate E because we're not looking for a reason not to wear my jeans. The remaining two options then become the choices to decide from. 6. Based on the context, it seems unlikely I will buy the same jeans again. This is because the question is about \"If I like the jeans, I will...,\". It's not about a random choice, but about my choice, based on my opinion of the jeans. 7.

Choices:   A: too bad B: not important C: bad news D: a great problem E: sad to hear\nRationales: The question is asking what the employee experiencing an unallowable amount of vacation days may feel. \nHere, we are seeking the answer within one of two possible scenarios.\n\n1. Assuming scenario A, the employee is actually eligible for more vacation time than permitted, then it must be difficult news as the employee will not be allowed the additional time. \nThis scenario provides the most direct and clear-cut answer, using a less figurative word that actually encompasses the correct meaning, thereby eliminating many unnecessary or less relevant answers.\n\n2.

This leaves choices C, 'anxiety' and E, 'energy'. Given the question, these are most likely the best options to choose from.\n7.

Therefore of the remaining choices, C, 'anxious', has the best fit due to its relationship with 'performing', which it expresses as a reluctance to act on a performance.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: Anxiety.\n\n###### Note: While choice D: happiness can be ruled out, the word \"nervousness\" can be used in place of \"anxiety\" to reflect its meaning. There is no grammatical rule prohibiting this here.", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "flys', doesn't fit because although butterflys are a psychological sign of nervousness, they don't exactly relate to the concept that talent persons can't suffer from any. \n5. Choice D, happiness, can't be the correct choice. Happiness doesn't sound like a reservation about performing. Also, happiness is a mood or a state, not a personality trait. \n6. We can look at Choice E, 'energetic'. An energetic person can mean someone who is full of energy or someone who is overly energetic, so not everyone who is energetic is suffering from nervousness. There's a difference between someone who is energetic and someone else who wants to avoid performing. \n7. So, the best answer is Choice C: anxiety.\n8. If we look at the rest of the question, the answer is definitely Choice C: anxieties, as it suggests that these people are likely talented, but reluctant to perform. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: What happens when someone runs fast? Choices: \tA: their legs get tired B: they slow down C: they get stronger D: nothing E: they become older\nRationales:1. The question is about the effect of running. 2. The best response is 'they get stronger'. 3. First, let's eliminate the incorrect answers. 4. Choice B: as no option does the opposite of getting stronger, the only option that allows for this is B. 5. Choices A and D: this does not make sense as you might get physically stronger, but your legs tiredness could still make you slow down when running. 6. Choice C: this doesn't make sense as your strength and muscle can get stronger, but not your age. 7. There is only one remaining option: 'C: they get stronger'.\nAnswer: D: C: they get stronger\n\nInput: What does it matter to a person if their children choose to be vegetarian?

{"text": "fly', is irrelevant because it is not relevant within the context of what type of ailment the person may be experiencing.\n5. Choices C and D also can be eliminated because they do not make sense within the subject of the question. \n6. Choice C, \"Anxiety\" refers to the anticipation of performing and may not be related to stage fright. Choice E, \"Energetic\" is an adjectival word describing performance abilities, not the type of discomfort experienced in performing. \n7. Therefore, we can select choice D, \"Happiness\", \"nervousness\" or \"anxiety\" are the only options that would potentially fit as a potential response of the person not to continue performing. These options are not too narrow in terms of performance art.\nAnswer: D. Happiness.\n\nInput: I was given a recipe that took me five minutes to prepare. It sounded like it was something that would take me 30 minutes to prepare. Do you think it was worth it? Choices:  I haven't prepared it as of yet A: no B: yes C: maybe D: probably\nRationales:\n1. The question asks if the answer is yes, it will still take a long time.\n2. The question is implied in the recipe, and we need to figure if we want to prepare it now or not. \n3. Since you were given the recipe, you know how much time will be spent on the recipe. \n4. A would say no, you aren't prepared yet and it is unclear how long it will take. \n5,B says yes that it would take a long time without specifying the time. \n6, D would say yes with no elaboration. \n7. C would say that it probably would take a lot of time. \n8. D is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D is correct.\n\nInput: You need to figure out how to get home on this one stormy night.

{"text": "fly', makes sense, but does not apply to those who are talent and don't like performing. This means this is not a valid choice. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense as well. Those who are 'talent' but don't like performing wouldn't likely be happy in performing jobs. \n6. Looking at the leftover answer choices (C and E), we see that they are both psychological conditions, which would be reasons for someone to not like performing. \n7. We also notice that these both contain the word 'anxiety' in them, which is a very common feeling before a performance. \n8. Therefore, it seems likely the answer to this question is C: anxiety. \n9. This is because of the way it makes sense as well as because all of the remaining choices are similar, which narrows down the answer to a more specific psychological condition.\nAnswer: C. \n\n###\n### The task \n\nThis section presents a task that you should understand at a basic level so that you can complete the subsequent sections to get a deeper understanding of the task.

{"text": "fly', does not pertain to enjoying a performance and can thus be discarded.\n5. Choices C, D and E are all terms generally pertaining to psychological or emotional feelings. This makes them more likely options as they are more relevant to the context.\n6. Of these, choice D, 'anxiety', does not apply to either performing or feeling happy. \n7. Based on this logic, the best answer is therefore E: energetic.\nAnswer: E, energetic", "answer": " 670"}
{"text": "fly', is irrelevant, as the question is not about people in general, but about people with specific talents. \n5. Choice D, happiness and energetic, are too vague as they don't indicate what someone is feeling exactly, or how they are expressing that feeling. \n6. Therefore, we can narrow the choices down to 'anxiety' and 'can suffer from'. This is relevant for the context. \n7. However, anxiety is also a broad term that would be associated with a number of circumstances, such as general uneasiness, feeling overwhelmed or irritability. This is too broad to indicate only the reluctance of one's talent. \n8. It is thus not clear whether the individual suffers anxiety before or during performance, which would be necessary to answer the question. \n9. Based on this, the most suitable answer is 'can suffer from'.\n10. However, the question also implies that the person with the talent does not like performing. This implies that there is a link between the dislike of performing and the person suffering from anxiety. \n11. Hence, the link is that the person does not want to perform and thus suffers anxiety or dislike from performing.\n12. Therefore, the answer should be 'can suffer dislike for the performance'.\nAnswer: C: can suffer dislike for the activity\n\nInput: What was a great way to keep your pet safe while walking?

Thus, the option that makes sense is one that keeps the dog safe while walking.2. The given answers are A: a leash, B: a carrier, C: a dog park, D: a stroller, and E: all of the options.3. Out of these choices, some of them are directly related to walking a dog.\n4. These are C and E\n5.

{"text": "fly', is not grammatically correct. It's also unclear how this would be different from, or related to, 'anxiety'.\n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", does not involve suffering at all, as it is the opposite of suffering. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is a mental state related to the fear of performing, or uncertainty, which could be understood as an obstacle for anyone with performing talent. \n7. Choice E, ''energetic'', doesn't align with the personality traits described. While energy is subjective, anxiety is often described as the lack of energy, which is more accurate here. \n8. Therefore, by eliminating the incorrect answers, the best choice we are left with is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C; anxiety\n\nInput: Who is the first recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize?

Since we're looking to change hair color, we know that it must involve hair and hair products.\n2. Choice I, \"hairdresser,\" fits as it contains the word \"hair,\" and is a common place people would go to get a new hairstyle.\n3. Choices II, III, and IV are not relevant to hair color because they involve beauty, shops, or spas which refer to other products and services.\n4. Choices II, IV, and V all refer to establishments where you could change hair color.

However, if the person is truly talented and the performance is a type of art form, the anxiety they may feel could inspire creative output.

Choice C, anxiety, is the logical choice as it makes perfect sense - an inexperienced performer may be anxious about their performance so they don't perform as much. \n7.

Choice C, anxiety, seems like it could be a good match, but the given term anxiety is usually used to refer to an emotional reservation or fear about a particular task or situation, so the answer might be more specific to their concern about performing in front of others. \n7. As these terms are specific concerns about fear or anxiety about performing, we should now look to the remaining choices: Choice D, 'Energic'. \n8. The other four answer choices focus on psychological reservations or emotional problems, and this choice focuses specifically on a lack of energy. \n9.

The logical part of this question revolves around whether or not option E accurately reflects what the given data indicates.\n2. While option E states that the world's oldest males and females are equally aged, it makes an incorrect assumption that because males can live longer than females, that all women should follow the same pattern.\n3. Looking beyond the statement \"yes\" and \"no\", we have to determine what the data actually indicates. It makes no sense to assume women will all behave the same as the data suggests no such conclusion.\n4.

As anxiety is a psychological and emotional reaction, it makes more sense.\nAnswer: D. anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following is not an element of a sentence? Choices:  a. capital letters b. punctuation c. words d. capital letters and punctuation e. no capital letters\nRationales: As indicated by the given statements in the question, the choices should be arranged in a way that leaves only choice b: punctuation is not an element of the sentence. Therefore, the correct answer is 'C: words'. This choice makes sense when considering an element of a sentence comprises the constituents, in other words words and their meaning.\n\nInput: When it comes to learning, a lot of people often try to understand, what? Choices: a. the definition of understanding b. the definitions of understanding c. understandings, what a person understands d. understand what other people understand and what a person misunderstands e. nothing but what someone else has misunderstood\nRationales: The question requires the user to determine what people often try to understand when it comes to learning. After evaluating all the given choices, the correct answer turns out to be 'd. understand what other people get' and what a person misunderstood'. As indicated by their placements in both this and the next question, these choices follow the exact same pattern - each of them are the inverse of what they are asking about at that particular moment.\n\nInput: A lot of people often try understand what?

{"text": "fly', while somewhat clever, is not actually valid because it doesn't make sense. \n5. Choice D, happiness, probably has not affected this person because the question says they'seem happy', not that they actually are. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, while not completely irrelevant, does not seem likely for a person who is otherwise content. \n7. As such, we can safely cross out Choices B, D and E.\n8. Choice C, anxiety, seems to fit well as people often use the term 'butterflies' as a euphemism for anxiety-induced restlessness.\n9. Therefore the answer is B: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: What animal gets nervous in unfamiliar places? Choices:  a: coyote b: squirrel c: fox d: monkey e: squirrel\nRationales: Choose the animal that gets nervous in un familiar places.\n1. We don't know why the animal is nervous, which means we need to eliminate any options that are specifically directed at a cause. \n2. As nervousness is a common trait for people, it's safe to remove Choice A: people are not relevant to the answer. \n3. Like Choice A, Choice B, coyote, is an animal that people are familiar with. But coyotes are often nervous, which would mean that removing Choice B would still be valid. \n4. As Choice C: fox is also related to humans and thus relevant, it's safe for us to cross out Choice C. \n5. Likewise, Choice D, monkey is relevant to humans, who are the subject of this question. As such, it's safe we cross out Choice D, as well. \n6. As Choice C, fox, is not related to humans we can safely cross it out. \n7. At this point, by eliminating all answers that are related to the human, we know that the creature that answers this question would have to be an animal that's not human. \n8. As all remaining choices are other animals, we can eliminate this entire branch. \n9. As Choice C is an animal that is not related to people, we can cross", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "fly', is not relevant as we already know there is a talent, and it does not mean the person does or does not enjoy performing.\n5. Choices C & E, 'anxiety' and 'energy', are also not relevant. \n6. Choice D, happiness, could be related. Perhaps happiness hinders a performer, or happiness is the feeling when performing. \n7. However, as we already know that people with a talent do not enjoy performing, and we also know that people who like their talent often find joy in their talent, we can eliminate choices D & E as well. \n8. This leaves us with two options, 'talent' and 'anxiety'. \n9. 'Anxiety' is a psychological state characterized by feelings of nervousness, apprehension and fear leading up to an event. \n10. If a particular person is experiencing anxiety, this could very well prevent them from performing. But, the question is specific to talent, not anxiety. Anxiety itself is not a talent. \n11. Therefore, the correct answer is 'talent'.\nAnswer: A: talent", "answer": " 108"}

Choices: A: vaccinate everybody B: wear face mask C: eat food\nRationales: Here is the answer:  1. As we understand the definitions of pandemic and vaccination, these terms are closely related, as a pandemic is defined as an outbreak of a disease on a global scale. \n2. As such, the answer to the question is to 'vaccinate everybody'.  \n3. Vaccines are created, with a relatively high rate of success, to counteract epidemics and spreading diseases. \n4. Therefore, vaccination is the best response to what the question is asking, as it directly counters acts of epidemic spreading. \nAnswer: A: vaccination\n\nInput: I am trying to put a word to a person with a name like Lacy, what is her name?

Choices:  C: 20% B: 80% D: 100% E: 0%\nRationales: The question asks about the percent of a child's body that were legs.\n1. A person's height can be divided up into several different aspects such as the length of the legs, torso and arms so it is obvious that a person only has a maximum possible total of 100% of their height that is legs. \n2. Since the body of the child was not specified in the question, it could have been a child of any height who was just referred to by their legs. \n3. We can determine that 20% of their height was legs. \n4. The first step could be to divide the height by the height of the legs. If we assume that the height and the legs are both positive numbers, we get the following: \n  * (length of the child) / (length of their legs) = child's height / toes\n  * (1.2 / 1.4) = 1.2 \n  * child's height / child's height = child's height\n  * 3 feet / 3 feet = 3 \n  * child height = 3\n5. So then we can say that the child's height is equal to 3 feet. \n6. Then the child's height multiplied by 100 is 300. \n7. Then child's height", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "fly', and Choice C, 'anxiety', don't make sense, as in both options, talented people are not suffering from these issues. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense either, as being happy isn't necessarily connected with performing in particular. \n6. Choice choice E, 'energy', isn't relevant either because this option implies not having enough energy. If someone has been given a task to perform, it will take energy, so they would either have a lack of it, or find enough to fulfil the task. \n7. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the best possible answer is 'E'.\nComment:\nAnswer: Choice E.\n\nInput: What are two things a person should do first before buying anything? Choices: 1: A: buy it with a good price 2: B: try it to see if it's good 3: C: learn more about it 4: D: not buy it just because they think they need it 5: E: compare it with the other options\nRationales:\n1. The question is posing a series of possible questions that someone might ask before buying something. \n2. The first choice \"buy it with a good price\" makes no sense as you should buy it at any price unless you have an extra budget.\n3. Choices B, D and E are all good options, but Choice D is more direct in asking \"not buy it just because they should think they need it\". \n4. Therefore, the best option is D: not buy it because they think they need. This is because you should not buy something because you think you need.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: Someone might feel sad when they get good grades, and someone might feel happy if they get bad grades. How can we describe this feeling? Choices: A: happy and sad\nB: happy sad\nC: happy or sad\nD: sad or happy\nE: sad or happy or\nRationales: This question is asking how can someone explain both feeling happy because you received a good grade and feeling sad because you received a bad grade. The correct answer should be a statement that encompasses multiple emotions and provides a comparison between a positive and negative emotion. There are six possible answer choices and multiple possibilities exist for both A and E", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "flys' is wrong for several reasons. First, a person would not just'suffer from injury', but would perhaps also suffer from butterflies. Second, talent does not describe a particular physical form or stature that defines their anatomy. This makes it hard to interpret this line of text. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't fit as it isn't a physical state, but rather an emotion that people experience. The sentence also implies that the person does not have happiness in performing, even when they are naturally talented in that regard, which seems to contradict.\n6. Choices C and E are also irrelevant. \n7. We can infer that an anxiety may be a result of a talent that is not enjoyed or expressed. Thus, we start looking at all the choices that mention anxiety. \n8. Choice B, \"anxiety\", doesn't fit since anxiety refers to a mental state, while performance does not imply that the person is anxious, but rather that they're not comfortable or don't enjoy performing.\n9. Choice D, the same as choice B, \"anxieties about performing\", doesn't make sense, as anxiety is already mentioned above. \n10. Therefore, the best choice is A, \"injury.\" \nAnswer: A: injury.", "answer": " 1000"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as the idea is an untalented person is likely to have butterflies.\n5. Choices C and E are both emotions and out of place in this context. \n6.

Choices: \nA: obstetrician B: pediatrician C: family doctor\nRationales: The question wants to know what kind of doctor treats pre-natal children. Given that this doctor would be working with babies in utero rather than during their birth. \nTherefore, the question wants to know about obstetricians. \nAs a family doctor can provide multiple types of medical care for patients, obstetricians work specifically with pregnant mothers and fetuses. In short, it's about their specialty. \nAs pediatricians care for newborns shortly after their births, the question is asking about a specific medical profession needed for prenatal care.\nRationale:\nInput: How does an author decide what to write about? Choices: \tA: research B: personal experiences C: inspiration D: imagination E: dreams\nRationales:\nInput: What does the phrase, \"in due course,\" most likely indicate is about to happen? Choices: A: a wedding B: a funeral C: a baby shower D: a graduation E: a birthday party\n\nRationales: I will begin with an example of \"in due course\". Most people probably remember the 2016 Olympics being held in Rio de Janeiro. The Olympics in Brazil was delayed one hour because of the announcement about Zika virus. This means that there was a time constraint to the ceremonies as we were waiting for the event to begin. During \u201cin due course\u201d, it means there was a delay to move to the next part of the Olympic ceremonies.\n\nAnswer: C: a baby showers because a baby shower is a special event that happens when a baby", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "fly', makes no sense because it is not about a personality trait. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense because the question states the person is suffering. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, could be related because anxiety is a psychological condition related to the act of performing or facing an unknown. So, while it does fit, it isn't the only thing. \n7. Choice E, energy is a state of being, not a psychological condition, so it doesn't make sense in relation to this question. \n8. Because option C, anxiety, is a good fit, it is most likely to be the right answer. \n9. Therefore, it is likely the answer is C: anxiety. \n10. Another option is B: talent persons cannot perform talent and butterflies, which is technically incorrect, but can be helpful in identifying the best answer because it describes a personality that fits closely with the question.\nAnswer: D. Talent persons cannot perform talent and happiness.\n\nInput: How would you determine the correct measurement for the width of a doorframe? Choices: 1. A: compare sizes with known measurements 2. B: measure widths from a single surface 3. C: measure widths from three different angles 4. D: estimate the measurement based on the length of the wall 5. E: take notes from a website\nRationales: Question: 1. 'How would you determine the correct width measurement for the length of a doorframe?' This is asking what we would do to get an accurate width measurement for a doorframe. \n2. First, eliminate irrelevant possibilities. 3. Choice A: compare measurements with known measurements, makes no sense because the given measurements in the question aren't measurements at all. They are descriptions of the surface of the doorframe that we are trying to measure. 4. Choice C: measure widths at from three different angles. This is related to the idea of measuring width from multiple angles, but it doesn't help solve the question. \n5. Moving onto the more relevant choices, choose E: take notes from the website and go with it. 6. Choice B: measure widths at a single surface, is a good answer choice because it aligns with the context of the doorframe. A doorframe", "answer": " 768000"}
{"text": "fly', is not relevant either. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is also incorrect. The question doesn't state happiness, it states talent + performance = happiness. So, it doesn't make sense.\n6. Choices B and D don't make sense, because butterlies could be an issue, but injury probably wouldn't be a big issue, and they would probably love being at the recital because they're performing a role they've been practicing for.\n7. Therefore it's unlikely that they suffer from anxiety.\n8.

Looking at Choice A, if you wear a jacket, you won't suffer from the summer heat, but you wouldn't be wearing an ideal summer outfit. We can eliminate this choice, and move down the list.\n2. Consider Choice B: a skirt will make your legs hot, which would make you sweat, but you'd still get the summer sun. We can eliminate Choice B.\n3. Let's look at Choice C: a jacket and shirt. Although you aren't getting burned, you aren't showing any skin, and you're probably hot - not a pleasant summertime outfit.\n4. Choices D, E, and C, are all too heavy. We can eliminate them.\n5. Finally, we have Choice A, shorts and shirt. It's too informal, and leaves exposed skin, which leaves the chance for your skin to get sunburned. We can eliminate this.\n6.

Choice C, \"anxiety\", can be attributed to many emotions, and may be related to the subject's feelings about performing or being in the spotlight. \n7. Finally, Choice E, 'energetic', is not related to emotions so we can eliminate it.  \n8. Among the options, \"anxiety\" seems relevant to the description given in the question.  \n9.

{"text": "fly', does not make sense as it does not align with the general phrase'suffer from' when describing a concern about performance. \n5.

Louis Pasteur \nRationales: This is a tricky question because the names presented don't clearly match the criteria given. However, this question is asking for a name with the initials \"L.P.\", which can help to narrow down the choices. \n2. To begin with, we can eliminate unrelated choices.\n3. Choices b and d don't fit because their initials don't match with \"L.P.\"\n4. Choice e doesn't match because it's not clear that it relates to breathing at all, let alone gills.\n5. Choices a and c don't match because they don't have the first initial \"L\" and their last names don't have the word \"Pastor\".\n6. Thus, the remaining options are choices B and C. \n7. However, the only name with the initials L.P. in choice B is Thomas Jenks, who was indeed a scientist who observed how fish breathe through their gills. \n8.

Choices:  C: cold night D: heat E: injury F: blow\nRationales: To begin, identify what the question is asking. \nThe question is implying a scenario where ankle-high, socks are worn for protection against something, but what exactly? \n\nNow that we understand the question, we can start eliminating incorrect options. Starting with 'C' as it relates to cold nights. Certainly, having warmer socks can protect your ankles on a cold night or foot, but protecting against a blow is not one of the relevant topics under consideration. \n\nSimilarly, 'D' also eliminates the correct answer. There is no specific threat to the foot during a race of 'heat' so it would not be relevant to pick'socks' as the only protection to the foot, let along the answer. \n\nNow, 'E' can be ruled out as no injury can be prevented directly by ankle-highs, as opposed to just protecting your feet while running. \n\nWe are left with three options 'F' (blow), 'B' (foot) and 'A' (feet). We can go straight to the answer here, by recognizing 'F' is the incorrect answer as there is no blow involved, only a blow protecting one's foot from a further blow. A blow preventing a blow is just as redundant and the same logic of going to the next choice. \n\nIf going to another choice than the final choice is ok, then 'A' must be the correct answer.

We know performance can be emotionally draining, so perhaps a happy person would be energized? \n6. And yet, happiness likely isn't a problem for someone who doesn't like to perform. They would likely find many other things to make happy too. It's the performance itself that the person has difficulty with. \n7. Choice E, energetic, is too vague. Being energetic doesn't have anything to do with performing. Plus, many people could be described as energetic, not just someone who isn't inclined to perform.\n8. Choice C, Anxiety, is a legitimate answer that would make sense here. \n9. Therefore, we can cross off C Anxiety.\n10.

Choces A, C, and D, are all too vague to use as an indication of if the candy was bad or not.\n5. Choise B, \"It was pretty much okay\", is the correct answer as it describes the candy as bad but not terrible and makes sense with the sentence.\n6. Choise B: 'it was pretty ok' is the answer, as it is the most indicative of the given sentence and provides a response that makes sense with the sentence given.\n7.

When looking at Choice D, 'happiness', this doesn't make sense because the point is that the performer doesn't like performing - they're not choosing to do it. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", does refer to a psychological discomfort, so it's the correct choice. \n7. Therefore, it's reasonable to pick Choice C, anxiety. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following best describes the shape of an octagon? Choices:  a) has curved lines b) has smooth straight lines c) has sharp corners d) can fit only one octagon into a space where you could fit two squares for more information: In geometry, an octagon has eight points, while an octahedron has eight faces. An octagon is also shaped like a square. But we're looking for a geometric shape here\nRationales: The question is asking about a shape - an octagon. \nThe only shape given in the questions that does not fit is square. \nSquares and octagons are shapes that have completely different shape attributes. The other choices do fit: they have straight, curved, or smooth lines. \nAnswer: a) has curved or smooth lines.", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "flys', it does not make sense to say 'persons', as 'person-people' is more grammatically correct. Further, it is also unnecessarily specific and repetitive. \n5. Option C, 'anxiety' is unlikely to cause a person to not want to perform based on the information given.\n6. Similarly, if someone is talented but does not have feelings of anxiety, they are likely to feel less inhibited by feelings associated with performing. \n7. Therefore, it makes more sense to choose option D, happiness, as this would have an opposite affect to anxiety and allow the person to perform.\n8. One might then consider whether performing makes them happy and whether not performing causes them to have feelings of anxiety. \n9. In order to support this, it is likely that there would be a link between their mental state and their ability to perform.\n10. Choice E, \"energetic\" is not an emotion, rather it is a state of being. Thus, it does not make sense for a person to perform out of energic.\n11. One might then consider emotions that might be caused as a result of performing and which might result in a person not feeling capable of performing. \n12. Thus, a person could not feel capable of performing if they were suffering from anxiety. Therefore, the best option is D: happiness.\nAnswer: D.happiness\n\nInput: When you want to find people with specific skills, what do you look at? Choices: 1. A: a contact list 2. B: resume details 3. C: work history 4. D: their websites E: references\nRationales: The question is asking what one should look at to search for people with a specific skill.\n\n1. As the question specifically states that we are looking for people with a specific set of skills, Choice A, 'contact list' is not an accurate answer. A contact list could contain contact info for everyone or it could just be a list of contacts generally. It doesn't specify that the contact list should contain a set of people with particular skills. Further, it could be that the people are on a single contact list. There is nothing to suggest that the person searching for a skill needs anything beyond the names of the people in question and their contact information. \n2. Choice B, resume", "answer": " 3600"}
{"text": "' refers to an unrealistic rule in the sense that it assumes an unattainable reality in which talent persons cannot ever injure themselves. Also, this rule refers to 'talent persons' and yet the subject in question is an individual who suffers from anxiety.\n5. Choices C and D refer to emotional states, and while either could be related to the person in question, they are not the specific concept referred to in the question.\n6. Therefore, the only remaining choice that makes sense is Choice E: an energetic person can be reluctant to perform in fear of performing poorly.\n7. Thus, the best answer is E: energetic.\nAnswer: E : energetic\n\nInput: How can you tell the location of an airbnb listing? Choices:  \"A: When you book the unit, the host will provide details such as the street/avenue and unit number of the property.\" \"B: When you are in the unit they will post a paper in the main window to show the location.\" \"C: You can see if in the rental agreement.\" \"D: You can see in a picture provided by the rental advertisement.\" \"E: You can see in the address of the postcode.\"\nRationales:  1. The question asks about how to find the location of an Airbnb listing. \n2. There are several options provided that all pertain to the process of obtaining or learning about that location. \n3. While each option is correct in some aspect, let's eliminate the ones that are incorrect. \n4. Option A mentions the location of the property rather than the listing, which is what the question asks for. \n5. Option B makes good sense and relates to Airbnb listings, but assumes that a postcard at a window can be obtained when there is no guarantee that this will be done. This option also mentions the location of the listing rather than how to find the location. \n6. Option C also makes good sense but presupposes that the rental agreement shows this information. There is a possibility that it does not or that it could be missing. \n7. Option D is somewhat related to getting the location but assumes that a picture of the listing property would also show the location. A picture, however, could show a map of the area, with the listing not always appearing", "answer": " 84"}
{"text": "flys' sounds like an incorrect phrase, so it too should be eliminated. \n5. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, seems unlikely as someone who feels happy probably feels excited about performing and isn\u2019t overwhelmed with anxiety in their everyday life. \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2018 seems like the best fit, as it can involve physical symptoms such as butterflies, as well as psychological anxiety about a performance.\n7.

Choices: \nA: grief B: confusion C: worry D: sadness E: disbelief\nRationales: Look at the question and the choice options to identify an answer that does not apply to the question at hand.\n1. It helps to note that we are identifying a natural reaction to finding that an old loved one has a disease.\n2. Reviewing the option choices, we can rule out \u201cdisbelief\u201d and \u201cgrief\u201d in the following ways:\n3. \u201cDisbelief\u201d is unlikely, because even though it can be a reaction, it is more often that older loved ones are actually very sick, more than an assumption.\n4. \u201cGrief\u201d is very unlikely because it\u2019s an emotional reaction, and the older loved one has more often than not been ill for a long time before it was diagnosed.\n5. Hence, the answer that does not make sense is \u201cdisbelief\u201d, and that is not something that someone would be having when the older loved one is terminally ill.\nAnswer: \u201cdisbelief\u201d\n\nInput: Which statement is INCORRECT\nA: The man made some delicious brownies\nB: The man ate some brownies\nC: The man got some brownies\nD: The man baked some brownies\nE: The man saw some brownies\nRationales: Identify the statement that does not make logical sense within the context of the problem.\n1. It\u2019s most obvious that \u201cThe man made some brownies\u201d is the statement that doesn\u2019t make sense, as it doesn\u2019t show up as making sense with the rest of the statements.", "answer": " 49200"}

Choice D, happiness, doesn't relate as it doesn't describe why someone would suffer when performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, could be a possible answer because it describes someone's emotional state in the lead up to performing. It fits but isn't specific enough as it doesn't refer to performing per se. \n7. Choice E, energetic, is out of the question as it doesn't reflect poor performing either! \n8. Choice C, therefore, is what makes the most sense to answer the question.\nAnswer: C; anxiety\n\nInput: The professor wanted to give him the best chance to do well, so he picked out the most basic class he could? Choices:  C: simple; easy B: none; complicated D: all of the above\nRationales:1.The question asks why the professor would have chosen a more challenging class for the student (who had trouble in advanced class).\n2. It'll be hard to figure out why the professor hasn't chosen the most challenging class if you don't take a look at the alternatives. \n3. Looking at the possibilities: \n4. Choices B, C and D don't make much sense because: \n5. Choices B, none and complicated make no sense - the easiest option is a basic class, as 'basic' implies it's as easy as possible.\n6. Choices C, easy and simple don't make much as they don't fit to the context.\n7. Choices D, all of them, also don't make much since simple, easy, and complicated refer to the process of education, not to the subject material.\n8. If a class is easy to do and simple, it's likely not the best choice in terms of teaching approach, thus the professor would likely have picked a more challenging course instead.\n9.

Choice D, happiness, doesn't seem to fit the context as it seems a bit far-fetched to say that someone who has talent but is not interested in performing would be happy.\n6. Choices C, anxiety, and E, 'energetic', appear to fit this context, though they fail to explain the cause of the situation. \n7. Therefore, it seems that the best option would be Choice C, 'anxiety', as the context fits the meaning in such a context and a person with anxiety may not have the desire to perform, even if they have talent. \nAnswer: C: Anxiety\n\nInput: A _______ allows people to communicate by sending and receiving text, messages, and digital audio through wireless networks  Choices:  A.

{"text": "fly', isn't specific to what the individual in question is feeling about performing. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is incorrect because happiness is a feeling, not an illness.\n6. This is relevant because feelings can, however, be used to diagnose and describe an illness. \n7. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019 is not related to feelings, and so it should be rejected.\n8. Next, consider Choices C and B, and consider that they both imply a struggle with anxiety. \n9. Choice C is more specific, so it is more relevant - even if it's not the \"best\" answer.\n10. Therefore, the answer for this question is B: anxiety. \n11. When you read through your choices, you can always look for the best answer. But, the best doesn't always have to be the correct answer. 12.

Choices:  a) Dial 911 b) Call the cops c) Do not call any number d) Go the doctor e) Go to the emergency room \nRationales: The question asks if we should 'dial' or call emergency services during an accident. Here, we are looking for an action that will be taken after an accident in the event that it happened.\n1. Looking at option A: dial 911,' it's important to note this is asking about the emergency phone line. Emergency phone lines are for communicating with the police and other emergency services, which means we're looking for an action that is done after the accident, and after the accident, we should get police and other emergency service involved. So, we are going to mark down option B: call the cops.\n2. Next, we consider option C: do not call any number. Remember, we're looking for the action we should perform after the accident. So the question is asking about police and emergency service. So, it does not make sense to choose option C.\n3. Similarly, option D: go to the doctor, doesn't make sense since this answer requires us to visit a healthcare facility, which implies the victim just experienced", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "fly', isn't correct, as butterflies are typically a source of anxiety, not a cause of it. \n5. Choice E, a feeling of energy, isn't necessarily a dislike of performing, but rather a feeling of being energetic due to the task at hand.\n6. Choices B and C, 'injury' and 'anxiety', respectively, are psychological issues which can result in a dislike of performing.\n7. Hence, we are looking for an answer that describes the psychological source of an issue, rather than a physical one like 'injury' or a psychological result like 'anxiety'.\n8. Choice D, a source of happiness, isn't correct, because 'a source of happiness' isn't a dislike that the person experiences. \n9. Choice E, the feeling of being energetically, isn't correct as it isn't specifically due to a disliked activity, such as performing. Choice D, therefore, remains our final choice.\n10. The conclusion is that the best answer to this question is choice D: a feeling of energy.\nAnswer: D.Feeling of Energy\n\nInput: The new student was a quiet person, she often kept to herself.

Looking at 4 D: school parties, 5 E: school classes and 3 C: school fundraisings, one could incorrectly assume that this includes 2 B: school activities and 1.

{"text": "lies', is incorrect because a talent could involve singing, which would cause someone to feel nervous or have butterflies before a show. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't fit the context either, as it doesn't seem to relate to nervousness.\n6. Choices B and D are not completely irrelevant though as they have qualities related to performance, so we should consider them for a moment. \n7. Looking at choice D, 'happiness', we see that it is more specific than choice B, 'talent person cannot suffer from injury and anxiety'. \n8. The idea of suffering is a broader concept than anxiety because suffering involves an emotional or spiritual aspect, while anxiousness focuses more on the physiological response. \n9. So while choice D doesn't fully make sense in terms of its exact phrasing, it does have overlapping concerns with the previous choice, choice B. \n10. Because of this, by eliminating choices A and E, we know choice B, 'talent person does not suffer from injury and anxietly', does not fit the question.\n11. Therefore, we know choice D, 'hapiness', is one of a few answers that don't make complete sense in its phrasing but might nonetheless address the concern of one experiencing nervousness about performing. \n12. However, this does not make the best answer for this question because it is more specific than the others. \n13. Choice E, happiness, is the least specific. This might seem reasonable considering the question doesn't ask for a specific response, but we consider that an answer should be as specific as possible in order to be the best choice. \n14. Therefore, the answer that makes the least sense if we're answering with the least amount of information is choice E, 'happiness'.\nAnswer: E: happiness\n\nInput: What's a good definition for a good life for a farmer?

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense given that butterflies are not related to physical injuries. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't relate to the act of performing, as that is often a nerve-wracking experience. Also, most people who pursue performing arts do so because they want to make an impact, not necessarily to be 'happy'.\n6. Choice B, anxiety, seems like it would make the most sense, as it's what is most likely to prevent an individual from carrying out their talent.\n7. Therefore the most rational answer is C: anxiety. \nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: Who is the manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers?

Choice A, Ron Cey doesn't have the job of manager as he is listed under 'Current Active Players'.\n3. Choice B, Walter Alston played for the Dodgers, but he is not the manager of the Dodgers. \n4. Similarly, Choice C, Jackie Robinson does not hold the position of manager. \n5. Next, let's look at Choice D, Don Mattingly, and Choice E, Joe Torre. \n6. While Don Mattingly played for the Los Angeles Dodger, he is not listed as the current manager. However, Joe Torre is a former manager who held the position, making him the right answer.\nAnswer: D.

{"text": "fly,' doesn't make sense as butterfly's are described as winged insects, not a talent-related term.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', do not fit the context since neither of them are associated with a lack of interest in performing.\n6. Choices E, 'energetic,' could potentially describe someone who performs, but that doesn't necessarily describe someone who likes to perform. \n7. Therefore, we know the answer is Choice E, 'energetically.' In other words, someone who feels energized by performing.\n8. However, the question still remains unclear. Why do they like or want to perform? \n9. A closer analysis of the question reveals that the question is asking why people like to do what they do or love to do. \n10. Let's look at each option to see the best answer. \n11. Choice A, \"'injury,' doesn't fit,\" as an injury is a tangible, physical type of hurt, not a psychological feeling.\n12. Choice B, \"Can't\" doesn't make sense since it doesn't follow the question's sentiment or intention.\n13. Choice C, \"anxiety\" doesn't fit the context since anxiety is a feeling, not a reason to perform.\n14. Choice D, \"happiness\" doesn't fit as someone is sad in this context.\n15. Choice E, \"energetic\" is the preferred answer because although it is a positive term, it can still be read as simply feeling good while performing or otherwise.\n16.

Choices:  a: the leader b: the boss c: the employee d: the performer e: the performers\nRationales:\n1. Given this description,  likely the leader is the person who commands the most attention from the crowd of people.\n\n2. However, boss is the person whom the employee reports to directly, so does not necessarily have much to do with this question.\n\n3. Performance refers to something that is done on stage, not necessarily done by a person. So, e is incorrect.\n\n4. c, Employee, may be performing, but this answer refers to the person who gets paid for performing and is not necessarily the best option.\n\n5. Looking at choices left, a, leader, makes the most sense because it involves a person being recognized and having a commanding presence. This is something not just limited to their position as a leader, but also something that applies to them regardless.\n\n6. Therefore, our answer is a: leader.\n\nAnswer: A: leader. \n\nInput: Which of these are types of computers?

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as it implies that this talent must be able to suffer from injury, but only talent people cannot experience butterflies. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\" does not make sense in this context in relation to the question. It would generally be an incorrect answer, but in the context of this question, it's explicitly wrong. \n6. Choice C, \"Anxiety\" does make sense in this context as performing is sometimes stressful, potentially inducing anxiety in the person. \n7. Choice E, \"Energetic\" does not make sense as \"energetic\" is typically associated with being passionate and enthusiastic, rather than not liking to perform. \n8.

Choices: A: anagram B: acronym C: abbreviation D: rhyme E: haiku\nRationales:  1. The question asks about a word made up of five letters.\n2. Choice A, \"anagram,\" doesn't contain the correct number of letters.\n3. Choices B and C, acronym and abbreviation, both contain the correct number of letter and they both have a relevant meaning. \n4. A common abbreviation is \"ac\", which comes from the root word \"accelerator\". Therefore, it cannot be correct.\n5. Therefore, it's reasonable to conclude that choice B is an acronym and choice C is an abbreviation, making them the most likely answers.\n6. Choices B and D, \"rhyme\" and \"haiku\", are not words of only five letters.\n7. Choices D and E, rhyme and haiku, respectively, are poetry types that don't necessarily have to contain only one syllable.\n8.

If this was the case, the person wouldn't need to be talented. \n5. Choice D, Happiness, could be seen as a type of reservation due to lack of happiness, but this is not explicitly stated and this does not adequately describe a 'talent person' in this context, indicating that they like or wish to perform or have talent.\n6. Choices B and D both suggest a lack of something, such as confidence or the ability to perform. This is different to what we are asking, as we are seeking a reservation in regards to a desire to perform.\n7. Choices B, D and E, all discuss things that cause people to feel anxious or energetic, which are feelings that aren't discussed with the original question.\n8. Choice C, Anxiety, is probably the most fitting of options since anxiety can be cause by a lack of motivation which can affect performance. Given that this option is closest to the correct answer, this is the best option to choose.\nAnswer: C- Anxiety\n\nInput: You like the beach, you should think about what?

Choices:  a) Dazzling b) Cute c) Rich d) Stable e) Stunning\nRationales: The question asks which words are used to describe a man such man who is handsome, rich, and/or stable.\n\nThe words \"man\" (the singular form used in describing someone generally), \"handsome\", \"rich\", are all used to describe a single person, and not a separate man.\n\nIn addition, neither \"stable\" nor one of the other options are used to describe a single man.\n\nFurthermore, \"stunning\" refers to what is generally beautiful or attractive, but it does not refer to being \"handsome\" specifically, so it cannot be used to describe someone who is handsome.\n\nAs we can see, the most appropriate answer here is \"e: Stunning\".\n\nAnswer: Striking\n\n### Diversity\nYou are a writer. You have to describe how much you would like to work there, and why?\n\n1. When you first apply for a job in your area, you will often write a letter of introduction to the employer, in which you explain who you are, and why you are interested in working for them. \n2.

What were the most likely result of this behavior\nChoices:  A: she was arrested B: she went to rehab C: you were scared D: an angry mob came after her E: she had a mental breakdown\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about the likely result of a woman's angry yelling.\n2. Looking at their choices, we can quickly eliminate any options that are not relevant to the behavior in question. \n3. 'She went to rehab' and 'You were scared' don't make sense within the context, as yelling doesn't describe going to or being scared.\n4. 'An angry mob came after her' doesn't make sense within an internal setting.\n5. 'She had a mental breakdown' or 'She suffered a mental breakdown' doesn't quite work because a mental breakdown indicates a longer process, and this case is specifically about the woman after yelling.\n6. Therefore, the best possible answer is 'you were scared', as the behavior of yelling can be related to a fear response, which this example indicates.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: \"If the doctor gives you prescription and you take it to the pharmacist, you will be told what?\" Choices:  A.

{"text": "fly', doesn't fit either as the sentence is only describing one type of emotional reaction to performing; not listing multiple reactions.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', cannot be ruled out, as they are both emotions. \n6. However, they don't quite fit with the scenario. For one, the given sentence implies a lack of positive feelings towards one's talent, so \"talent person cannot be anxious\" doesn't make much sense.\n7. Similarly, \"talent person cannot feel happy\" can be true, as one's personal feelings toward a talent may not match how others react to it. Yet, this isn't relevant to answering the question of what someone with talent but negative feelings toward performing has \u2013 they simply have negative feelings, not positive ones.\n8. Therefore the answer must be option E, 'nervous'.\nAnswer: E: nervous\n\nInput: What are the two sides of the ocean?

The answer we are looking for should be an option that is problematic with the student's response on a test.\n2. We have 6 options so we will examine all of them\n3. The student has not studied for the test so we can eliminate Option B.\n4. The student was being dishonest which is a problem but isn't what the question asks us to find. We can't eliminate Option C until we have all 6 options\n5. The student was dyslexic so we can eliminate Option D\n6. We look at Option E but the question didn't say the student can't read the question so we can't eliminate option E\n7.

{"text": "flys', is incorrect as it contains several grammatical errors. \n5. Choice B, however, provides insight into the correct answer, but a little more context is needed. \n6. Choice B implies that talent persons don't like performing because they can experience physical issues during shows. \n7. However, we know that the person in question is talent but doesn'd like to perform. This suggests that what may be holding the person back is anxiety.\n8. Choices C and E, both referring to emotions, are not relevant as the person is concerned about their talent, not how they feel. \n9. So, we know the answer is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D \n\nInput: The boy's grin was contagious. Therefore, he needed to? Choices:  a: stay home. b: go to school c: get more sleep d: go to sleep e: go to class f: stay quiet\nRationales: In this question, the grin of the boy was described to be contagious, which means his smile is infectious and people could not help but smile around him, too.\n\nChoices: 1. Choice 1: a: stay home.\n\nChoice 2: b: go to school\n\nChoice 3: c: get more sleep\n\nChoice 4: d: go to sleep\n\nChoice 5: e: go to class\n\nChoice 6: f: stay quiet\n\nIn the options, 'a: stay home', 'b: go to school', 'd: go to sleep', and 'e: go to class' are irrelevant because they do not support the question which requires a specific action that the boy should take so that he could stay happy. The question is not asking what the boy should do rather it is asking what the boy should have been doing in order to spread his happy grin (contagious grin). In 'c: get more sleep', the boy should get more sleep only if he is not sleeping well enough and, in this case, 'd' would likely be the answer because he is sleepy. A contagious grin spreads happiness to everyone around, even happy and sleepy ones. In 'f: stay quiet', the boy is not instructed to stay quiet when he has to speak (i.e. he has something to", "answer": " 12834"}
{"text": "fly', is not a logical conclusion and doesn't follow from the premise of the question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, would not likely preclude someone from performing, even if they were nervous, simply because experiencing joy and pleasure, by itself, does not hinge on whether someone feels comfortable and happy while performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, does make sense, however, we have already eliminated choice C since it doesn't follow logically, so it is likely not the correct choice. \n7. Choice E, energy doesn't mean not performing even if it is enjoyable.\n8. The best answer then, when considering the given information and the choices, is choice D, 'anxiety' since there is no logical contradiction and it does make sense that it would not allow someone to freely perform despite enjoying it.\nAnswer: D.\n\nInput: When a person asks for a ride home, they may be asking for the? Choices:  1. vehicle 2. time 3. space 4. a place to rest 5. something else\nRationales:  1. The question is posing a set of five options, and asks to \"tell me the option that describes what the rider needs\".\n2. Looking at each option and comparing them to the premise given, we can eliminate a few. \n3. For example, Choices 4 and 5, 'a place to rest' and'something else', don't describe space but rather a non-physical need - comfort and the ability to relax. \n4. Because of this, choosing'something else' is not appropriate. \n5. Looking at more logical connections between the premise and the options reveals that only options 1-4 have any plausible relevancy.\n6. Comparing these options with the word choice, we can arrive at Choice 1 with confidence: when a person asks for a 'ride home', they may be asking for a vehicle, because a ride refers to traveling.\nAnswer: D, vehicle\n\nInput: Whenever a person asks for a free ride, what are they likely wanting?

Choices: A) An introduction B) A discussion about benefits or other compensation C) A discussion about expectations or goals D) Any of the above\nRationales: The question is asking what you should do when starting a job interview. \nLooking at the answers, A) introductions are generally given at the start of an interview, such as by saying \"Hello, my name is...\" so they should not be given after starting an interview.\nC) The question doesn't specify whether the interviewee should discuss the topic of expectations or goals.\nAs C can refer to any interview-related conversations, it makes sense to eliminate it from contention as we search for the correct option.\nB, a brief discussion about benefits and other compensation, is also unnecessary as it can be discussed after the interview itself has ended.\nTherefore, D, 'Any of the above', is the best answer because it is a broad statement of a wide range of possible options such as introductions, discussions about benefits or compensation, or any of the other available options.\nAnswer: C) A discussion about goals and expectations\n\nInput: What types of pets do people prefer?

Choices:  Cabbage B: Carrots D: Cream cheese E: Lentils F: Peas\nRationales: The question is asking for the food item that is not a vegetarian option.\n1. Option A, Cabbage, is not a vegetarian food item.\n2. Choice B mentions carrots.\n3. Choices C, D and E all mention vegetarian food items as their options. They thus, do not fit the given scenario, rendering them incorrect.\n4. For the correct answer, we must look at the choices that are vegetarian.\n5. If we exclude the ones that are already correct, we are left with Choices F and Peas\n6. Choice F, Peas, can be considered a vegetarian food item because it is made of vegetables.\n7. Similarly, Choice E, Lentils, is also vegetarian since they are made exclusively from lentils.\n8.

{"text": "flys', is also an irrelevant answer choice. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\" is also an insignificant possibility as although happiness has been shown to affect a performers' performance, it shouldn't take the place of talent when describing how someone expresses their talent. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is irrelevant because a performer can suffer from anxiety at work and still enjoy it. In this scenario, the person is only experiencing anxiety when they are performing, not because of it. \n7. Choice E, \"energy\", is also out of the question as no matter how much energy a person has, they can still fail to enjoy performing.\n8. Therefore it is reasonable to conclude that Choice D, 'happiness', is the most plausible option. \n9. Option A, 'injuries' could be related to the choice of 'happiness' as an injury could physically prevent someone from performing; however 'injuries' in this context is a more relevant answer to an entirely different scenario. \n10.

They first looked at the playing surface, and then looked at what? Choices: A: the goal posts B: the field markers C: the fences D: the pitch marking E: the players\nRationales: The question describes the player's attempt to figure out if they can play a match on a certain type of ground, so the players looks at the \"ground\" first. The player then looks for clues on if they can continue playing. As the player asks about \"the pitch\" or \"the ground\", that means he is looking at markings and such features, that provide a useful information about the pitch. \n\nAnswer: C: the fences\n\nInput: The professor wanted his students to know how to create a research paper from scratch, so he started by giving a research paper, giving tips on how the students can research", "answer": " 810"}
{"text": "fly', is incorrect for two reasons. \n5. First, butterfly isn't the name of an injury, so it doesn't make any sense here. Secondly, persons aren't necessarily defined as people with talent. \n6. Choice C, ''anxiety' is, as it refers to a mental or emotional feeling, not a physical problem. \n7. Therefore, choice D, 'happiness', or Choice E, 'energy', can be used. \n8. Looking down these, we can eliminate choice E as there is no reason to suspect that the person is not happy with their performance. \n9. There is some ambiguity around choice D, happiness', as there are other definitions of 'happiness' and 'talent' in addition to our main choice, which could throw off your interpretation of the question.\n10. To eliminate this confusion, we can narrow down our choices to the two that most clearly describe the question: Choice C, anxiety, and choice D, happiness. \n11.

Ultimately, Choice C, 'anxieties', would be the better answer here as it is the simpler choice. \n9. However, neither answer is the best possible answer, as the subject doesn't need to suffer anxiety to avoid performing.

However, in the context of a performance, 'butterflies', could refer to nerves or excitement which is related to performing well; while anxiety is related to a sense of insecurity or worry in relation to how the performance may go.\n9.

{"text": "fly nervousness' is a misnomer as it's the person and the talent that can suffer from anxiety.\n5. Choices C & E, 'anxiety' and 'energy' are relevant possibilities.\n6. A possible scenario could be that the person is a shy or introverted personality type. For example, a person may have stage presence but is terrified of performing. This would explain why they may be talented but not happy performing due to their natural disposition. \n7.

This question asks, in what order are these relationships to be ranked, given that one of the relationship types is of greater importance than another.\n2. Let't start by comparing the first of the two choices, '4: 8:  6: 2:1: 3:  9: 5:  7'. \n3. The options seem to list the items randomly with no obvious order. If you look closely, one thing is certain - items ranked as '4: 8'  are less important/significant than the others.\n4. It would make sense that item 4 and item 8 are ranked the lowest, as a hierarchy of relationships, item 8 may refer to the lowest relationship, and then item 4 may likely refer to one of the next least important or strongest relationships.  \n5. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the relationship is of greater importance as it is related to '4' then '8', thus giving them two stars.\n6. So, if we were to rank the choices, the order of ranking would be 8: 4: 6: 9: 3: 1: 2: 7\n7.

{"text": "lies', isn't a possible psychological concern (a 'butterfly' is slang for anxiety), but more a logical fallacy (suffering is usually a negative experience and thus cannot occur alongside pleasure such as the happiness described in option E). \n5.

This leaves options C and E.\n7. Based on the given information, it is unlikely that option C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, is the correct answer choice. Anxiety is typically characterized by worry, feelings of doubt and a strong desire to avoid the object/person that causes the anxiety in the first place. This is not reflected in our given context.\n8. So, the answer that still makes sense is E: energetic. \n9. In this case, a likely cause for the person's dislike of performing would be nerves or fear of public speaking, which have nothing to do with enjoyment or pleasure.

Choice B, \u2018anxiety\u2019 is more relevant because it pertains largely to the person\u2019s emotional state over performing rather than how they physically feel. This makes it a likely candidate. \n7. Finally, Choice E, \u2018a feeling of energy\u2019 is incorrect. Energy is a word typically referring to one\u2019s physical state, not mental. \n8.

We know that the scientist observed something in the lab, but this wording implies that if the scientist observed something negative happening in the lab, they would observe a chemical reaction that causes someone to get nausea.\n3. However, choice A may still be incorrect because the question isn\u2019t asking the subject of the study, but, rather, the objective of the study. \n4. Taking the question into consideration, when we look at choice B, \"a formula for a chemical that cause nausea\", it fits much better because the scientist is looking to observe a formula. \n5.

{"text": "fly', is not a complete phrase as it mentions neither 'butterflies' nor 'injury', thus it can't be the correct choice. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness,\" is neither a psychological nor physical condition, making it irrelevant here.\n6. After comparing, we are left only with choices \"anxiety\" and \"energetic\".\n7. Anxiety does make sense in this context, as it is a possible psychological barrier to performers.\n8. So, the response that makes the most sense here will be 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: The people in the restaurant are always ready to eat? Choices:  a: dinner\nb: desert\nc: desert\nd: dinner\ne: meal\nRationales: In this example we are talking about the people in \"the restaurant\" as in the group of diners.  \n1. In order to solve this problem we need to understand the text and determine the context.\n2. Notice that we are answering a Yes/No question so we need to find the word \"are\" which can be found with the term \"ready to eat\". \n3. Remember the text mentions that the food items are \"always ready to eat\". It does not mention \"always ready to eat\" in case of the diners (people in the restaurant). \n4. We can eliminate choice \"B: desert\" because it does not mention \"are\" with the word \"eat\".\n5. Choice \"E: dinner\" and \"D: dinner\" do not make sense. If the food is ready to eat people (dinner) will eat the food. \n6. Choice \"C: Desert\" sounds like we need to search for the word \"ready to eat\" in the phrase \"desert of food\", however, the word \"deserts\" can also mean \"the state of being desolate and uninhabited\".\n\nAnswer: \u274c\n\nInput: What does the word \"nonsensical\" mean? Choices: A: does not make sense B: makes sense C: does not feel right D: makes you feel bad\nRationales: Let's breakdown the word and define it: \"Non-sensical [adj] = not sensible; not reasonable, practical, or logical: 'n", "answer": " 504"}
{"text": "fs', isn't correct as it's not the talent person who suffers from injury. The talent does not have an issue performing when injured. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not consistent with the prompt, as talent could stem from any source of inspiration. 6. Choice E: energetic, doesn't make sense either, as the question doesn't suggest that the person is overly energetic.\n7. The only remaining choice is C: anxiety. This choice is consistent with the question. \n8. Hence, the answer is C: anxiety\nAnswer: C: anxiety", "answer": " 11"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense. A butterfly is an insect, not an emotion or psychological reaction. This also implies that talent persons cannot suffer from anger, love and so on. \n5. Choice E, energic, is not typically used to refer to an individual's psychological state. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is probably the answer that comes to first mind. It's commonly known to affect people, and there's certainly nothing that says that anxiety is not shared by talent persons. However, anxiety is usually related to the ability to perform rather than the desire to perform. \n7. Choice C, being anxious about performing and liking performing are not the same. Anxiety relates to performance, but liking or not liking perform is a separate issue. \n8. Therefore, it makes sense to choose choice D, 'happiness'.\n9. Choice C, could be considered as an alternate answer as it's very close to the question given, but it's more associated with performing talent rather than the more general liking-not-liking ability/impedance given in this question.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: happiness.\nAnswer: D. Happiness\n\nInput: How many words are there in a dictionary? Choices: 32,000 A: 4.550 B C: 32,550 D E: 4,550\nRationales: The question, \"how many words are there in the dictionary?\" is similar to that of \"how many coins are in a pile of pennies\". It is commonly established that piles of pennies contain 99 pennies, 198 pennies, 297 pennies, the answer is clearly not 4,555. \n1. The question does not provide the context in which the dictionary's word count is to be defined. Dictionary definition is very specific to its definition, and would be subject to different definitions in different publications. \n2. So, the question doesn't make sense, unless the intention is to point out the difference between pennies and dictionary definitions.\n3. Without any additional information, the question doesn' have any logical answers. \n4. Therefore, it's appropriate", "answer": " 92"}
{"text": "fly', is incorrect. 'Persons' is not a grammatically correct word - rather, we should be searching for a word to describe a group of talent people, such as 'talented people'. \n5.

{"text": "lies', is incorrect as there may be multiple ways for a person to suffer in different forms.\n5. Choices C and D are incorrect as well because they reference specific anxiety-related experiences, as opposed to generic anxiety, which may have multiple triggers.\n6. Choices A and E is the best candidates. \"Anxiety\" can arise from many different triggers, and \"energetic\" can also be seen as a psychological trigger.\n7. Therefore the most viable answer is to pick the answer that describes a more general psychological issue, which is anxiety.\n8.

Choices: A: stay out of it B: use the word no C: ignore D: give a hand E: help out\nRationales: Choices: 1. The best option must be one that helps the other person but doesn't invade their privacy.\n2. Invasion of privacy is when you intrude and violate another person's privacy.\n3. Choices A and B, \"stay out of it\" and \"use the word no,\" respectively, are irrelevant because they don't have anything to do with privacy.\n4. Choices C and E, \"ignore\" and help out,\" respectively, are also irrelevant because they refer to not acting with the correct intention but not invasion of privacy.\n5. Choose D, ignore. \nAnswer: D: ignore\n\nInput: The two students were so into their game that when they hear their alarm clock? Choices: A. they woke up happy B. they were shocked C. they ignored it D. they were displeased E. they were embarrassed\nRationales: The question asked what the student would do when their alarm clock went off. \n1. You need to remember the context of the game to make the right choice. \n2. The two students were so interested in their game-playing, that they would not notice anything that happens when the alarm clock went off.\n3. Choose E, they were embarrassed. Choices A, B, and C doesn't make sense.\n4. Choose E as the answer.\nAnswer: E. they were embarassed\n\nInput", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because if you suffer from something 'and butterfly', it could be either talent or injury, but not both. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't fit as it is related to energy levels and not psychological ailments.\n6. Choices B and D remain as possible answers based on general, broad concepts, such as anxiety (a common emotional response to performing) and happiness; but nothing explicitly relates to performing in a way that would suggest a person might struggle to enjoy performing.\n7. The best answer is A: 'injury', as it is the only option left that is based on a person being able to suffer from an injury or inability to perform, not psychological or general issues.\nAnswer: A. injury\n\nInput: Why was Bob angry? Choices:  the phone was ringing as the entered the room B: he could not find the key C: you could not go to sleep D: he was hungry E: he did not get the position\nRationales:\n1. Why was Bob angry?\n2. Bob walked into a room.  The phone was ringing.  Bob became angry when he arrived in the room. That is, Bob became angry upon hearing the ringing phone.\n3. The word \"did\" in this context is often used to mean \"became\".\n4. The question is only asking why Bob became angry.\n5. He became angry upon hearing the phone ringing. So, his anger is related to hearing the ringing phone, not to finding the key nor the position.\n6. Therefore, Bob became angry because the phone was ringing when he walked into the romm, as can be inferred from the sentence provided.\n7. Thus, the best answer to this question is E: he was hunting.\n\n### Solution:", "answer": " 95"}
{"text": "fly,' refers to talent as an entity separate from a talent person, which doesn't make sense in context.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety,' and D, 'happiness,' do not describe specific mental states but rather emotions in general.\n6. Choices E, 'energetic,' doesn't refer to mental state either, but it does specifically relate to a person's energy level, rather than state of mind or psychiatric condition. \n7. Considering the above facts, the answer is A, 'butterflies' because the word refers to an expected condition a performer may experience before a show.\nAnswer: A. butterflies\n\nInput: Some people say that we learn better by understanding things ourselves and not by a lecture. What is the correct response? Choices:  I agree, understand why. You might be right  A: I agree, you are correct  B: We can both be correct  C: That makes sense and I agree  D: No, that's not true\nRationales: To say that we learn better...(we can insert information you've been told), and not by a lecture (teacher) indicates we do that ourselves...(what you have told us). 1. This indicates that some people believe we do best, when we can do it ourselves. (our own efforts)\n2. What we have been told, is that there are two responses to this question. Those with \"I agree\" have a different understanding of a lecture than those who say \"no, that's not correct.\" Those who agree agree. Those who do not, don't agree. \n3. If I \"agree,\" meaning I agree or agree with other responses, I say \"Yes, I think we can learn best ourselves.\" It will make sense to others who will say the same!  We agree with the statement and we say why. \n4. Example Answer: \"Sure I agree too! A teacher has a lot to do. A lecture might not be the best way to learn, and I know how valuable it is for you to be able to do it yourself.\" (A: I agree, understand why) \n5.

However, emotions are not mentioned as part of the question, and a talent person who does not enjoy performing may not feel one way or the other.\n7. The only possible option left is E, 'energy'. This choice seems most fitting as it directly describes the reservations around performing an art that the person may have.

We know for certain that the movie is one in which a person is murdered, as the mother is nervous about 'watching a person being murdered'.\n3. Considering the answer choices, we can eliminate the choices that don't make sense. \n4. \"The green light\" is not a person murdered. It's a reference to a literary work that deals with a person who commits suicide. \n5. \"The mask\" is a reference to a horror movie in which a person turns into a killer. While a person is killed in this movie, it probably doesn't directly relate to a movie in which a person is killed.\n6. \"The great gatsby\" is a literary work that also deals with murders. \n7. \"The shining\" is a horror movie in which an axe murder occurs.

Note that there are a few different ways to count note taking as taking notes for 38 minutes, for example, could include taking notes for 37 minutes and then continuing to take notes for 1 minute after that time. However, these different ways to count how long the student had been taking notes do not affect the answer. 2. Consider the options. 3. Choice 1, 45 minutes: To get 45 minutes, we would begin by taking notes for 15 minutes, then take notes for another 30 minutes, all while adding a few more random minutes after each time to continue counting for a few extra minutes. The end result is 45 minutes. 4. Choice 2, 54 minutes: This is more complicated to calculate because we would first need to determine how much time went between the time the student started taking notes (which we know to be 0 minutes) and when he began to take any specific notes (e.g. 1 minute). Once we know that, we can figure out how long the student took to add all of her notes for the first time since she started taking notes. Then we would add a few extra minutes on top. The end result is close to 54 minutes. 5. Choice 6, 46 minutes: Once again, we have to determine how long", "answer": " 132"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as the phrase contradicts itself. There must be at least some overlap if people with talent feel nervous or have anxiety.\n5.

Therefore, we can eliminate all the other choices, and the answer that remains is E: energetic as this is the only answer that makes sense within the context of the question.\nAnswer: E - energetic\n\nInput: What are an important quality to look for in a leader? Choices: 1. A: experience in leadership 2. B: someone capable of making hard decisions 3. C: the ability to motivate 4. D: intelligence 5. E: someone who stands up for justice\nRationales: The question asks for an important quality to look out for in a leader.\n1. Experiencing in leadership doesn't give enough about a leader or what makes them effective.\n2. Someone who makes unthoughtful decisions might still be a better leader than a competent leader who lacks moral conviction.\n3. Capability to motivate others doesn't mean that a person has the best skills set to be a leader.\n4. Capability to do something isn't enough for a leader who doesn't motivate others.\n5. Intelligence is a necessary element but it isn't enough without moral conviction or leadership qualities. \n6. Standing up for justice, or a commitment to fairness, is important, but doesn't completely sum up what a competent leader needs.\n7.

It would be more correct to change the second part to \"talent person\" and \"can suffer\" since this makes more sense in the context.\n5.

So choosing these options would require additional explanation as to why they are specifically'related to performing'.\n7. As for Choice E, 'energy', it would make sense to choose that if there was a performer who could get energized when performing, but it doesn't seem to make much sense in this context.\n8.

Choices: \n A: bailiff B\n C D\n E\n Rationales: 1 The question is about who the lawyer is who would work for the company being sued. This means the lawyer would be representing the defendant rather than the plaintiff.\n2. Since a \"bailiff\" is a court officer, this answer is incorrect.\n3. Similarly, \"juror\" is incorrect as the person they would be working for is the defendant, not the plaintiff, meaning they would not be a juror during the trial.\n4.

Moreover, the choice lists an absence of a psychological reservation as reason of incapability; however, this option does not define what someone without butterflies or injuries cannot suffer from. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is too specific. The phrase 'butterflies in the stomach' connotes the psychological reservation that can accompany a performance, but does not imply that talent persons cannot ever experience happiness. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is better because it covers a wide variety of psychological factors that could accompany a performance.\n7. Choices E, 'energetic', doesn't indicate any psychological condition.\n8.

Choices:  a: church b: rehabilitation program c: pharmacy d: mental health clinic e: physiotherapy clinic\nRationales. 1. The task asks for which medical care centre people with chronic pain typically go to for help.\n2. 'Chronic pain' is a long-term medical issue that typically affects the body so it is reasonable for us to assume that medical care centres can help with this.\n3. Let's look at the options for help that are available to people with chronic pain:\n4. a) Church: 'church' typically refers to a place of worship or faith, not to physical health care.\n5. b) Rehabilitation programs: rehabilitation programs are geared towards physically recovering a disabled or ill individual. It is helpful to people with chronic back, knee or joint pain, but it is not the answer to the question.\n6. The pharmacy offers medication. People with chronic pain can go there to receive prescription medications to help alleviate their pain, but this doesn't necessarily get them medical attention for them chronic pain.\n7.'mental health clinic' or 'physiotherapy clinic' could be used to treat chronic pain and thus would be relevant to this question.\n8.

Therefore, we're left with choices B and C. \n8. Choice B, referring to the inability of talent persons to suffer from injury and butteflies, does not directly relate to the dislike of performing. So this must be eliminated. \n9. Choice C, referring to anxiety, does not make sense as a response to the given information. As we know, anxiety is related to physical and mental reactions to psychological stress. So, this choice doesn't directly relate to the question.\n10.

Choices: 1A: Fatigue B: Fit 2B: Anxious C: Happy 3C: Lacking 4C: Bipolar\nRationales: Question 1: 1) Exhaustion is a good starting word as it refers to an excessive weariness as a result of over-work. 2) Anxious is a close match, but it would be more likely for someone to be anxious about finishing work, rather than about over-exerting themselves. 3) If you're doing too much work, the likely effect would be fatigue or exhaustion, which is ruled out as too many alternatives, making it incorrect. 4) Fatigue refers to mental or physical exhaustion.

Choices C and D are unnecessary in that 'anxiety' can result from any situation, and 'happiness' may not apply if the person is unable to perform, which would affect their mood.\n6. Choices E and F are also not related to the performing context, which means that the individual is either suffering from anxiety or a different psychological condition caused by performing, but there is nothing to suggest that they are suffering from butterflys or being energized.\n7. Therefore the best answer is that the person likely suffers from an anxiety related to performance.\nAnswer: F: anxiety\n\nInput: If you are in a room and it's locked, you can't escape.

{"text": "fly', is in fact false and contradictory. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is related to positive mental emotions that may arise from performing, but it does not directly refer to the person's overall dislike for performing.\n6. Thus, we are left with Choice C, 'anxiety' and Choice E, 'energetic'.\n7. While the person might be more enthusiastic when performing, anxiety is related to negative emotions such as nervousness, uncertainty and fear, and it is also characterized by an intense mental preoccupation, a tense and restless disposition, and a sense of being overwhelmed.\n8.

Choices:  G: accountant A: journalist B: surgeon C: writer D: nurse E: doctor\nRationales: The question asks for what type of work requires extensive focus or attention.\nChoices:\n1. 'G', 'accountant' often requires extensive focus to complete tasks such as bookkeeping or tax preparation as they can be complex and time-consuming.\n2. 'H', 'nurse' can require a great deal of focus and attention as they may be responsible for the care and health of individuals in hospitals or long-term care facilities.\n3. 'J', 'journalist' also often requires a great deal of concentration and focus, as they can be responsible for covering a range of topics in a short period, and may need to meet deadlines and adhere to strict reporting standards.\n4. 'M', 'lawyer' can require extensive focus and concentration, as they may be involved in high-stakes court cases or complex legal proceedings.\n5. 'K','musician' may require attention to details and precision in their craft and may spend a significant amount of time practicing, rehearsing and performing. \n6. Therefore, the best way is to eliminate choices that don't make sense under the context. First, eliminating choices related to law since lawyers don't often require extensive concentration.

As the question implies, it is more about the reason for refraining from performing rather than the reason for performing.\n6. What we can conclude from this is what that the person, despite having a talent they enjoy, has some form of hesitation for not performing. \n7. In other words, they're suffering from some sort of issue related to performing. That leaves us with Choice E, 'anxiety'. \n8. Because of its relation to performing, this makes sense.\n9.

This would directly oppose Choice D which states that talent persons will usually have an aversion to performing. \n6.

Choice B also provides an answer in regards with a talented person struggling psychologically and does not fit as the answer as we know that we already have a psychological answer in Choice A. \n8. So, only Choices C and E remain. \n9. Choice C presents symptoms of a mental issue, so it becomes incorrect. \n10. Looking at Choice E, we know that happiness and energetic responses to performing are not directly opposite and would not reflect a talent person. \n11.

Choices:  Do what she asks and get angry Do get angry and obey to instructions Do nothing Do as she said Do nothing Do as she tells\nRationales:1. The question poses the riddle of what our character would do given a set of instructions, which reads: \"She gave me instructions: \"do not drink any water!,' so I?\"\n2. We see from the beginning of the question that our character is getting instructions from someone about drinking water, and we can narrow it down further by looking at the various ways our character has been ordered/allowed to do something.\n3. The three options that don't make sense are: \"do as she says\" and \"do as she tells\" as the character is already giving an order rather than giving an order to do something.\n4. The options that don't match are: \"Do what she asks\" and \"Do nothing\".\n5. The character should not drink water, so it only follows that the character would become angry at being denied water. So, \"do as she asks\" and \"get angry\" are the only choices that make sense.\n6. The correct answer is therefore, \"do as she tells and get angry.\"\nAnswer: Do what she asks and go angry\n\nInput: He found a strange looking creature in the woods... What kind of animal was it?

{"text": "fly', also doesn't fit, as the entire phrase is grammatically incorrect.\n5. Choices C and D may also seem relevant, as anxiety and happiness are mental phenomena too. However, anxiety and happiness are emotional states or conditions. A person who is anxious would perform because he or she had to; and a person who is happy would perform because they enjoy being on stage. Choices which refer to an emotional state or condition do not necessarily exclude a person who likes performing from suffering from them. \n6. Therefore, we must be searching for something which would cause a person to dislike performing, despite the existence of a talent.\n7. Choices C, 'ansiety', and D 'happiness', do not make sense either because they directly contradict the claim that they suffered from anxiety or happiness, respectively, which is the exact opposite of not liking to perform, indicating the person is willing to perform despite their anxiety or happiness.\n8. This leaves us with Choice E, 'energetic'. \n9. While 'energetic' may refer to a physical or emotional state, generally it means 'dynamic', 'vital' or 'exuberant'. It can refer to either high or low energy levels. 10. So, a person who felt energetic would not be opposed to their emotions and would therefore be willing to perform again. \n11. While someone suffering from 'energetic' would not necessarily like performing, it does not exclude the possibility that they have a talent despite an inability to perform.\n12.

{"text": "fly', is illogical since it is a statement with a flawless parallel construction. If someone could not have an anxiety at all, their inability to have an anxiety would be impossible and thus, have no relation whatsoever to the word 'butterfly'. Similarly, a person suffering from an anxiety would not automatically have a butterfly. Hence, this is out of the picture. \n5. Choice D, is out-of-place as performing does not necessarily entail happiness. It can be stressful, or unpleasant, for example. \n6. Looking at Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energetic', does, however, fit this question.\n7.

{"text": "flys', may be confusing to think of as a choice for an ability, but this phrase does not make sense. \n5.

Choice C, \"anxiety\", is a mental condition that can occur before or after performing, making it a good candidate. \n7. While none of these options exactly address the issue of the person in question, Choice C, \"butterflies\", does provide a clue: Butterflies could relate to nervousness or anxiety in the context of a performance. \n8. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that the answer is C: anxiety. \n9.

{"text": "flys', implies that talent persons experience pain and discomfort, a contradiction to what we know about talent. \n5. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019 also does not suffice. Although it's possible for individuals to experience great happiness while performing, the idea of performing is not necessarily tied to the emotion.\n6. Choices B and D are still options and must be further examined, however. \n7. One explanation of being talented is being extremely gifted at something. \n8. Therefore, talented individuals who are not happy with performing would likely experience anxiety rather than happiness. \n9. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019 is likely the closest choice, as its connotations refer specifically to a psychological state and not just a simple emotion. \n10. However, even this choice is not fully appropriate because anxiety is something an individual experiences, not something a person is. \n11.

Choices E can be eliminated as 'energetic' doesn't have anything to do with liking to perform. \n7.

Therefore, it should be treated with great respect and care. Choices:  A; pigs B; cows C; sheep D; horses E; goats\nRationales: When we refer to an animal being \"domesticated\", we mean they are the species of a larger animal and have been adapted to live with humans for everyday interaction.\n1. Pigs are domesticated animals. However, it doesn't mean we should respect them greatly, since humans domesticate many species that often don't get respect.\n2. If we are asking a question that refers to a domesticated animal, it makes more sense to choose something that is more likely to be a species that humans domesticated than others.\n3. In this case, we can eliminate other items such as sheep and cows since they cannot be domesticated by humans.\n4. Goats and horses are also domesticated animals, but we can eliminate them because the question refers to an animal people are likely to interact with more frequently, so we would want to focus more on choosing something people tend to have a lot of interactions with, meaning we can eliminate the species that are less domesticated.\n5. Therefore, we have narrowed the four choices to choices C, E, and B.\n6. We have eliminated choices E and D because they are still more domesticated than choice B, meaning we can eliminate choice A.\n7. We can now eliminate choice C because horses are generally far more available to most people than cows. For example, when someone is at", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "flys', is actually a quote from a different context and doesn't explain anything about what is wrong with someone who has a talent but doesn't enjoy performing. \n5.

Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't make sense because if the person is talented but doesn't enjoy that talent, then the talent isn't happy.\n7. Choices E doesn't make sense either because the person isn't suffering from an energy deficit, there is no mention of exhaustion, lethargy or apathy.\n8. Therefore by eliminating all inapplicable choices, one ends up with Choice D: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C\" Choices: injury B: talent and butterflies  D: anxiety\nRationales: The question is implying 1.

Choices B and D are both ways of explaining a situation with the root cause of \"help needed\". \n4. But, both also suggest a situation where \"help\" isn't available - \"talent and butterflies\" and \"anxiety\".\n5. Choice E, \"happiness\" doesn't work because it is a result of help being received not the cause of the person needing it.\n6. In other words, we are looking for a situation where help cannot be received because of the cause.\n7.

Choice D, \"happiness,\" is too general answer to help us find the actual answer in this case. Happiness in general doesn't necessarily mean that the person in question will have less worries related to performing in front of a crowd. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety,\" is a possibility, but by definition it's a feeling of worry, not related directly to performing. \n7.

Choice A: A doctor's visit is a \"checkup\". This is a general term to describe a visit with your doctor to see if you have any major problems. For example, it could be your annual checkup or your appointment after your doctor suspects you have a problem. 2. Choice B: A diagnostic test is when you go to a doctor for information about your health. That is what it is called if the goal of your appointment is to diagnose you with a disease. 3. Choice C: A physical exam is a general screening to determine some basic information about your health and fitness. 4.

Choice B, talents persons cannot suffer from injury', refers to a fear of performing, or that an injury may affect performance. These don'ts describe someone with the performance ability who doesn't like performing. Therefore, Choices B and C don't fit for the question. \n6. Choice D, happiness, is a state of mind that could potentially allow someone to perform with ease. However, it does not necessarily cause a person to actually perform. \n7. Choice E, energy, is a quality of performance that causes someone to be able to be perform better. However, this doesn't affect whether performance takes place or not. \n8. So, looking at the remaining options, we can conclude that it's more likely to be Anxiety, because it's a state of mind that may affect a person's ability to perform. \n9.

As Nobel Prize winners are renowned experts in a particular topic, it makes sense to look for choices related to this specific field. \n2. Choices A, 'cancer' and B, 'a new virus' do not make sense, as they do not align with the context. Choice A refers to an illness, and Choice B includes words such as 'new,' which could suggest it is not something with already existing records. \n3. Looking for phrases or words that relate to historic records helps narrow down choices. Choice C, which says 'history', makes sense as it is related to historical documentation of past events. \n4.

Choice C seems to make the most sense out of what is left, however, 'anxiety' is more specifically referring to an emotion of fear or nervousness. \n7.

By ruling out incorrect answers, we find that choice D makes the most sense. \n8. The question asks what this person suffers from, not what person they suffer from. Thus, the person's talent does not suffer from anything as it isn't an entity that can be afflicted. \n9.

Because of the question, it is not likely the person is going to the peppermint section (although it is possible). \n3. Option D mentions the peppermints not having a section. This could be a viable choice for the person, but not for the question.\n4. The question specifically looks for where that 'person' is heading if they were going to the 'grocery store' section. \n5.

Considering that the choices provided include both anxiety and happiness, it's reasonable to think that perhaps someone may also have feelings of butterflies as they begin to perform. \n9. However, the presence of butterflies can be both a cause AND effect of anxiety, suggesting that it is more likely that the performer has anxiety, rather than butterflies.\n10. Since anxiety is related to injury, we can cross out choice A and B. \n11. Also, since choice B is not phrased as an answer, we know it is irrelevant and can cross it off as well. \n12.

{"text": "lies', is a grammatically incorrect phrase and is a possible solution to an unstated question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not the desired answer, as the person with a talent would want to perform, even if it made them slightly anxious.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety' and E, 'energy', are close to the desired outcome; however, they are too general and not specific to being able to perform.\n7.

{"text": "fly', is an incorrect structure of the sentence and doesn't describe a psychological affliction. \n5. Choice E, which describes a positive mood, does not make sense related to this question. \n6. Choice D, which speaks of a positive feeling, does not make sense as the person has a talent to perform but does not want to perform, implying that they lack confidence in their ability. As such, they may suffer from anxiety, leading to nervousness, hesitation, and other concerns. \n7. Therefore, we can conclude the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C, anxiety\n\n### Input: When a team is underperforming to the best of its capabilities, the manager should often give the team? Choices: \tA: confidence B: advice C: motivation D: a better view E: a good scolding\nRationales:\t1. The sentence's key idea is the manager's responsibility to support and motivate the team to perform to its best ability. The phrasing implies the team has already demonstrated this ability by performing at the expected level but the manager needs to facilitate the team's performance at a higher level.\n\t2. The question is not asking about the team's level or achievement in general, nor is it asking about the manager's own skills and abilities, so we cannot answer based on these factors.\n\t3. Looking at the choices: \n\t\t* A, 'confidence', describes an emotion which would not improve the team's performance, unless the emotional aspect was so severe that it was interfering with their productivity.\n\t\t* B, 'advice', does not facilitate the performance of the team, it simply offers suggestions to the team. Advice is typically provided by a superior to a subordinate, so it seems irrelevant to the question of supporting the team's performance.\n\t\t* C,'motivation', does not mean inspiring the team to perform outside of their expected ability. That would be better described as \"pushing\" or \"pressuring\" the team to perform, which has a negative connotation related to manipulation and forcing. In addition, motivation simply isn't described as giving the motivation needed to exceed the expected level of performance, so it's unlikely to be the correct answer in relation to the question", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "fly' (sic) is a non sequitur, as a person with a talent can suffer from anxiety, or other mental issues. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't apply since the question asks about a reservation about performing, rather than an inability to. \n6. Choice C, anxiety is the reservation most people will likely associate with performing arts. However, it isn't necessarily the only one. For example, we can imagine an anxiety that isn't specifically related to performing arts, as some people simply don't like the spotlight. \n7. Choice E, energetic, makes no sense as a description of someone who doesn't like performing. \n8. Therefore, we can rule out all the choices except anxiety and energetic. \n9. An energetic person typically doesn't describe someone who doesn't want to perform at all, so we can rule this choice out too. \n10. So, by process of elimination, the most plausible choice is C, anxiety. 11. Therefore, the answer to the question is C, anxiety, as that is what a well-examined person would likely associate with this type of reservation.\nAnswer: C-anxiety\n\nInput: How can a person find if someone has passed a certain age at? Choices:  VA: a birth certificate B: citizenship ID card C: hospital records D: the phone book E: the internet\nRationales:\n1. This question is asking how a person can find out if someone has passed a specific age.\n2. There are several possible options based on what information might be available regarding a person's age.\n\nRationales: As you are looking for the most likely answer: you consider what the question is really asking:\n\n```\n\"What can a person use to find out if someone has reached that age?\"\n\n```\n\nLook at the choices and consider their relevance.\n\n```\na birth certificate\n\na\n     citizenship ID card\n\na\n     hospital records\n\na\n     the phone book\n\na\n\n     the internet\n\n```\n\n\nThe relevant answer is probably a birth certificate.\n\nNow you consider the less relevant choice.

{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense as a grammatical issue. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", isn't correct because happiness may occur even without performing, while performing is necessary to suffer from fear. \n6. Out of these left-over choices, the only one that may fit is \"anxiety\". \n7. Therefore, this answer makes the most sense as an anxiety can prevent a person from performing, and it can be specific to performance arts. \n8.

Choices: \nA: to die without knowing \nB: to eat \nC: to grow \nD: to have no energy \nE: to have a problematic sleep.\nRationales: The question is asking what is likely to happen when someone sleeps at night, not during the day. By not explicitly mentioning this time-frame, we need to limit our answer to things that are typically only relevant to nighttime sleep. 1. Considering choice A: someone who is asleep has no awareness of their surroundings, which means they will not be aware if they are dying, so this isn't what will happen because someone is asleep. 2. Same logic applies to Choice B: if someone sleeps, they are likely to be unaware of what they are eating, so this will not happen. 3. Choice C: if someone is asleep, they are likely to grow, because sleep helps the body repair and grow. 4. Considering Choice D: someone sleeping would likely not have energy because their body is relaxed and at rest, and when the body is at rest, it doesn't have energy. 5. Choice E: having a problematic sleep is not likely if a person is actually sleeping. 6. The answers that fit are A, B and C because the others don't go well with the context of the question. 7. There are three similarities between A, B, C: 1. People who sleep aren't aware of what they're doing. 2. People who sleep are unaware that they're eating. 3.

{"text": "fly', is an awkward construction, and we shouldn't use the term 'person'. This could be translated as \"'People who are talented don't suffer from injuries.' butterflies\", which doesn't make sense either.\n5. Next, let's look at Choice C, 'butterflies'. This means anxiety, meaning that this person does not suffer from anxiety or nervousness. \n6. Choice D, \"happiness\", might seem appropriate for people not fond of performing, since performing is not always a joyful process. But this can be misleading, as happy people may not like performing and those that don't like performing may still find it enjoyable from time to time. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", does not refer at all to psychological states, such as anxiety or depression. Therefore, this is not a suitable answer. \n8.

Choices C and E, anxiety and energetic, do not directly implicate performance anxiety - anxiety could relate to a wide range of other areas of life, and energetic does not relate to anxiety at all.\n7.

Choices: 1: A: friendship B: love C: networking\nRationales:1. Given the choices given, the question relates to two people who do not share any common occupations. Therefore, we'll want to look at options that indicate common social circles or other common interest.\n2. Choice A, friendship, does not directly reflect the two individuals spending time together outside of work.\n3. Choices B and C, love and networking, both relate to specific interests that the two share.\n4. Choices A, B and C, friendship, love and networking, are not all mutually exclusive.

Choice B, \"enthusiasm\", is a different term than \"energetic,\" which has different connotations.\n7. This leaves Choice C ('anxiety') and Choice B ('talent persons cannot suffer \u2026' combined) as remaining options. \n8. It makes sense because anxiety is a possible negative consequence of doing something new or something scary and it's the thing holding the person back since they have talent and know how to perform but are just worried about performing. \n9.

Choices: 1. A: depressed 2. B: rich 3. C: richer 4. D: sad 11, 5. E: happier\nRationales: If we look at the options, we see that some imply a person is \"sad\" or \"depressed\" if they lose a job while others imply a person is \"richer\" if they lose a dog. This is true because if somebody loses something they value highly, they are likely to be sad about it, whereas if somebody loses something relatively unimportant, they are likely to feel happier.\n\nTo choose which one is correct, we should ask the important question: Do we lose something when we lose our job? Or do we lose something when we misplace our dog? From the given information, we can conclude that people typically don't think that they \"lose\" a job in the same way they \"lose\" certain physical things such as a pet or a wallet. Hence, \"richer\" is the correct answer.\nAnswer: D. Richer\n\nInput: In a room with pink walls and green chairs there are six boys and six girls.", "answer": " 64"}

It helps explain how and why a choice was made. \n1. The question is about why someone is not wearing a mask. \n2. Choice B: It doesn't make sense to say \"not wearing\" a mask is a right. The opposite of wearing a mask is wearing a mask, not the right to doing so. \n3.

Choice C, \"anxiety\", could potentially be an indication that the person might be anxious about performing, but there are other emotions the person might experience around performing such as nerves, shyness, excitement, and stage fright. Anxiety is just one of those emotions. \n7. This leaves us with Choice D, \"happiness\" and B \"Anxiety\". \n8. Both these answers suggest the person has anxiety, however, the former provides more context by specifically mentioning 'happiness', thus, narrowing down our choices.\n9.

Choices:  A : cleaning b: eating B: gardening C: dancing E: washing the car\nRationales: I. The question \"Which of the following activities is a known as a \"hazzard\"?  indicates that we are searching to find a word that can replace \"hazard\", however \"hazzard\" is an incorrect spelling of \"hazard\". \"Hazard\" is a noun that can be defined as \"An action, object, or circumstance that threatens safety\".\n2. Considering what a hazard can be, we can eliminate some incorrect answers. \n3. Cleaning does no typically cause accidents or have hazardous properties, thus, this eliminates choice A. \n4.

Choices A: graduate school B: high/secondary school C: college/university D: elementary school E: trade school\nRationales: There are many types of schools: graduate, high/secondary, college/university, elementary, and trade.\nA student who is looking for a job after graduating usually isn't seeking some sort of trade/technical training, nor would a high or elementary school student necessarily need to know the intricacies of graduate studies.\nCollege-university is too inclusive a term, as it would also typically cover the high-school level, which, as discussed above, is unnecessary for somebody entering the workforce.\nAlso, there are no options between college and university, as those would be used interchangeably.\nGraduate school is specifically for people who have already graduated from their undergraduate program, which isn't necessarily what is being asked here.\nThus, we can eliminate all but two.\nIn this case it's possible to split Choice D into elementary and high/secondary. We already eliminated high/secondary in the explanation above, so it cannot possibly be a correct answer.\nThe only remaining possible answer is Choice C, 'college/university'.\nAnswer: D: College/University\n\nInput: If I'm a good driver, why do I have a ticket?

Choice C, anxiety, is directly appropriate given the context. \n7.

Choices: 1.A: his opponent 2.B: the rank of the bull 3.C: the type and size of the bull 4.D: the placement of the bull 5.E: the cowboy who rode the bull\nRationales:  1.Based on the context of this question, the expert would review a) who is riding the bull, b) the bull's ranking, c) the bull' s particular features, and d) the placement of the rider in the competition. Therefore, each of the given choices can be eliminated.\n2.If the expert were examining the bulls to choose which bull to ride, they would most likely take into account the bull's size and weight. The bull may be too young or too old, too aggressive or too shy. \n3.It would also be important to examine the bull's rank. Bigger bulls with winning records are more powerful and intimidating than smaller, less experienced bulls who lack a history of success.\n4.An important factor is the rider's position. Some cowboys stand at the end of the row, where bulls tend to begin bucking. \n5.Opponents can also influence the bull's behavior. For example, the fear of an upcoming bull or competition can make a bull less likely to buck.\nAnswer:  C: The type and size of the Bull\n\nInput: A shark is one half man. What is one half of a man?

Choice C, C, \u2018butterflies\u2019, does not make sense as it is a feeling related to excitement which would generally be positive, not negative as seen in the question. \n8.

The question is asking which option would not apply. \n2. In this question we're asked to choose which of the answers does not fit into the \"you can write essays quickly\" box. So, it isn't necessary to know if the other options fit into that specific box.\n3. So, we can eliminate any answers we know don't make sense in that specific context.\n4. Looking at the options given we can easily see that B, C and D are not correct. \n5. Because B does not apply to a 'can write essays quickly' box, does not fit this category. \n6. Because C is able to find new places that it hasn't been too, does not apply to the context of writing essays quickly. \n7. Because D does not apply to the category of writing essays quickly, does not apply. \n8. So, choice D: I like writing to-do lists on phone does not fit.\nAnswer: D.

Choices C and E don't make sense as they are general emotions, which we know the person in question isn't experiencing.\n6. This leaves us with Choices B and D. \n7. As Choice D, 'anxiety,' best describes a psychological issue that is relevant to the question, it is the most plausible.\n8. Therefore we can eliminate the other choices. \n9. Therefore, we know the most accurate answer is Choice D: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "fly', refers to butterflies as an emotion and injury as a physical ailment. Thus, it does not make sense in this context. \n5. Choice D, happiness, seems to be an unrelated concept to the question at hand.\n6. Looking at choice C, it is apparent that the key ingredient of this word is anxiety. The prefix of anxiety, 'an', implies that anxiety is a feeling against something else. \n7. Therefore, anxiety might be an indicator that the individual lacks passion in their current pursuits. \n8. Since the question states that a performance art in which the person is talented may be less than desirable, it could be that they simply don't feel passionate about their craft and the question may also be referring to the fact that they are passionate about something other than performing.\n9. Thus, the answer would be choice E: energy level, because this is the most suitable phrase regarding 'energetic.'\nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "fly', means everyone who has talent is not subject to injury, which doesn't make sense. \n5. Choice D, \"energy\", does not make sense as the word refers to life force, not emotions. \n6.

Choice E, \"happiness\", is another feeling not typically related to performance.\n8. Looking at the remaining choices, the best fit seems to be A, 'anxiety', because anxiety is characterized by both emotional and physical symptoms, and the person might be experiencing it in relation to performing.\n9. The choice then becomes A: anxiety.\nAnswer: A, anxiety", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense as butterflies refer to a fluttering in the stomach caused by nervousness, while injury describes a physical effect of trauma.\n5. Choices B, 'talent', and D, 'energetic', sound like they could relate to performing arts, but these are not relevant as their relationship with performing arts isn't clear. \n6. Choice C, \u2018Anxiety\u2019, can relate to performance, because anxiety may cause you to be nervous or suffer from butterflies.\n7. Choices D, 'happiness', and E, 'theatre', are not correct answers as happiness doesn't usually hinder a person from doing something, and theater is just a place where many people perform.\n8.

The first two choices, \u2018pond\u2019 and \u2018snow\u2019 are neither a place nor particularly cold in relation to the question.\n2. Choice C is a mountain, but it hasn\u2019t been provided that this is the coldest during the coldest time of the year.\n3.

Choices:  A. find B: lose C: obtain D: buy E: search\nRationales: Question focus: 1. To what does the word 'duplicate' refer? (a.k.a. what does the question ask us about?) 2. How can we infer a person's probable action when faced with this situation? 3. If the person does not have a duplicate do they have the key? \nChoices, why they're incorrect/distracting: 1. The use of the word 'lose' is in reference to the person losing both the key and the key holder. The key can not be 'lost' in this scenario. 2. The word'search' while in a sense similar to 'lose it', refers to the action of searching for something, not actually doing so. 3. The use of the verb 'buy' seems to be an action the person does but that is not the focus of action. 1. A. Is an action the is not relevant in the question which also includes the word 'find'. 2. B, refers to an action done by the person who is in possession of the key to find the duplicate. 3. C, Is an action that is not relevant in the statement of the person to gain a key. 4. D, is an action that is not pertinent in this question because it is irrelevant to what the question asks of us. 5. E, refers to the finding of a key holder that is identical to the original key and does not refer to the original key holder. \nAn Example of correct reasoning: 1. The verbs within the question are 'lose/losing', 'finding' and 'obtaining/obtain'. 2. From this, we know that the key must be 'lossed' or 'found'. \n3", "answer": " 220"}

Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't relate to this scenario and is not a reasonable answer to the question. \n6.

A: $10 B: $20 C: an annual salary D: $1\nRationales: This question is about when telephones were first becoming available and asking what the cost was at the initial stage. The inventor is referring to Alexander Graham Bell, who invented the instrument. \n\nOne way to think about this question is how similar it is to a phone carrier charging different prices for an unlimited plan compared to a limited plan. While it may be true that the person with this contract pays $10 and $15, respectively, for that plan - the first plan was undoubtedly a far more expensive investment than the second. \n\nTherefore, since the person on the original plan, who in essence paid the same amount as the annual subscription, had to invest at least twice as much, $20 makes sense. We do not need the precise figure, as $20 will suffice.  \n\nAnswer: E: $1\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAfter some time and experience, one can develop the skills to identify the specific words used in a mathematical expression or to understand the mathematical principles behind a question. Such experience, however, cannot be found easily and quickly. \n\nIn the future, we should try to use a more structured approach.

{"text": "flys', is a confusing combination of an error in phrase and a questionable answer. It does not make sense as an answer.\n5. Choices C and D, 'butterflies' and 'happiness', are related to positive emotions, however, a reservation about performing would be different. The fact that they are positive emotions implies they are not negative enough to indicate the person may have a problem with acting. \n6. Choice B is a bit too general and doesn't make sense in terms of the context given. \n7.

Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales:  1. The question is telling us what will amount to be required to buy the tickets, if we wanted to bring our friends along. It also implies that we have the funds necessary to buy the tickets. What would it cost to buy the tickets on our own?\n2. The movie tickets can be bought separately, which is one of the choices. But, does buying the movie tickets make sense when we are simply trying to find out how much they would cost for us to go?\n3. Taking all of this information together, the answer we are looking for is the price of the tickets, for everyone to go to the movies.\n4. Looking at the choices we can see that there are a few that do not make sense. Choice D, is missing one of its words, making it impossible to know how many people will go. Choice E also does not make sense as it does not relate at all to the concept of the movies and how many people are going.\n5. Choiced B makes the most sense, because, just like the question asked, it is the amount of money necessary to buy the ticketes for all of us to go.\nAnswer: B", "answer": " 81"}
{"text": "fly's', does not fit because it implies a physical or mental blockage to performing that prevents the person from accessing or pursuing their 'talent'.\n5. Choice D, happiness, is not specific enough because happiness can apply to any situation, not just performing. \n6. Choices A and D, injury and happiness, can also both apply to a situation that does not involve performing. \n7. Choice E, \u2018energetic\u2019 is not an adequate response to the question as it can apply to a variety of situations unrelated to performing.  \n8. Hence, we can safely eliminate these options as they do not make logical sense according to the question at hand.  \n9. Choice B, \"anxiety\", is a mental disorder commonly associated with fear and apprehension. However, it is often related to physical manifestations \u2013 butterflies in the stomach or sweaty palms. \n10. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, is the more specific answer to the question as anxiety is associated with fear or apprehension.

A dog and a duck are not both feathered creatures, so Choices A and B are incorrect.\nChoice C fits the question, as an animal may have bones.\nIt is also possible that a duck enjoys eating vegetables and meat, therefore, Choice E is also an accepted answer.\nTherefore, the best answer would be Choice C: they have bones.\nAnswer: C) they both have bones.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\nThis instruction requires the examinee to answer a two-part math question in which they must correctly identify the correct option from a set of available options rather than calculate the answer to a specific question.

Looking at each of the answers in their respective order:\n\n   - Answer 1, \"James does teach,\" isn't correct because \"James does\" does not indicate future tense. It is, therefore, incorrect syntax.\n\n   - Answer II, \"James does is a plumber\" is also incorrect because the phrase 'is a plumber\" is the job title, it is not James, which he is listed as \"does\" following a comma.\n\n   - An answer 3, \"James is a plumber\" may seem correct, however, it is incorrect because the person \"is\" has commas, so it could also refer to other job titles such as \"James is police officer\".\n\n   - Answer V, \"James is a police officer, is incorrect because the sentence does not include a subject pronoun.\n\n   - As a result of that, answer 4, \"James is a teacher\" is correct because James is referred to as the subject, and the grammatical format is also correct.\n\n   - Similarly, answer 1, \"James is a lawyers\" is grammatically correct, but the subject does not accurately correspond to the title (James, not a Lawyer), it does not make sense.\n\n   - Furthermore, answer 3, \"I am a lawyer,\" is not grammatically correct and does not relate to the job title.\n\n   - Therefore, the answers 3 and 5 must be discarded.\n\n2.

{"text": "-flies,' has an error which is evident by a logical contradiction. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not relevant. If someone was talented, it is not logical to suggest that they could be happiness.\n6. Choices C and E are still not relevant because anxiety and energetic do not adequately explain why someone would suffer in the context of performing. \n7.

Choices:  - A: warehouse facility B: online site C: brick and mortar D: both online and brick and mortar E: none of these\nRationales: The question is asking about a bookstore which offers a variety of materials that includes books, movies, music, art, and other various objects.\n1. Since it is asking about a 'variety of materials,' it cannot be a warehouse facility as this simply refers to holding or storing a variety of items. \n2. Choice Online is referring to an online business, which does not offer its materials in person. However, choosing to shop online is an option that the store does offer. Therefore, this is not what the business asks.\n3. Brick and mortar is a common term for store which have a physical presence and operate from that location. Therefore, choosing this as the answer makes sense, but it is not what we want. \n4. So, we can now eliminate choices C and B, brick and mortar and online. \n5. Our next choice can be D, both online and brick and Mortar, but this also doesn't answer the question of the type of business. \n6. Our final option is E, None of Theses, which would seem reasonable to be the right answer since the bookstore does not offer any other types of materials, which the other choices reference. \n7. This is indeed a good choice, but our next step is to cross check that choice. \n8. Reviewing each other choice, it doesn't seem that any of them can apply the statement with the correct answers.

{"text": "fly', doesn't relate to performing talents as a person doesn't'suffer' from butterflies, but rather from butterflies being experienced during performances.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', D, 'happiness', and E, 'energetic', don't match how the question is phrased. These options are broad feelings and emotions that are not explicitly related to a talent or performance. \n6. Therefore, by taking away all the irrelevant options, to answer the question we need to focus on a term related to a psychological concern affecting someone's talent or performance. 7. Considering Choice D, 'anxiety' has the meaning the question is asking for - an emotional state that could potentially affect someone's talent. To understand how 'anxiety' might potentially affect a talent, imagine how having anxiety would make it harder to focus. \n8.

Similarly, while you can listen to music, you don't become less likely to remember by listening to classical music.\n8. Therefore we can say, choice A helps you study more to improve your memory while choice A and B improves your skill to do better. \n9. Choice D, exercise, doesn't improve memory itself.\n10.

Choice D, energy, doesn't make sense as energy is a force, not an emotion, so it cannot be an answer. \n7. Looking at the remaining answer choices, we can conclude that C, 'anxiety', and D, 'anxiety.', are the most likely options for a person to be reluctant to perform. While these answers do not provide the same information, they are most appropriate as answer choices. \n8. Therefore, C is the correct answer, as a talent person cannot suffer from a physical injury nor can they be reluctant from fear about performing.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense in this context because talents and injuries are mutually exclusive. Besides, the question specified that the person has a talent, not many. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't match the premise of the question, which is that someone suffers from an emotional restriction on performing, which would not necessarily be happiness in itself, but perhaps a fear associated with it, such as anxiety. \n6. Finally, Choice E, 'energy', doesn't fit either and is thus eliminated from consideration. \n7. With all of these reasons, we can determine that Choice C, 'anxiety', is the most likely option.\n8. According to the Oxford Dictionary, the definition of anxiety is \"a feeling of worry, nervousness, and unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome.\" The context of the question is specific in that it is someone refraining from performing due to an emotional or mental reservation. \n9.

If you are given all the colors of the Crayola set this might be an option, but without that context it makes little sense. II. Green is considered part of the color family of green/blue. Accordingly, describing the green color family can suffice here. III. Green and brown are both colors in the green/brown color family, but describing them both in a response can feel redundant/redundant. Further, a focus on the color brown doesn't really help identify the Crayola green shade as it can be a shade outside of what the Crayola set offers. IV. Red and red are both colors in the red/maroon/red color family. Again, we'd be describing the same thing twice if we chose the red option. \n5. V. Green, green/blue, green/maroon and green/yellow are all the potential options to describe the green color family. Thus, the best answer here is the green/blue family.\n\nAnswer: D. Green/blue\n\n### Demographics:\nIn grade math, 42% of students failed a math test with a specific number of questions. The test required to answer at least 15 questions.

Choices:  I. cover it with tomato sauce, sprinkle on fresh basil, serve with grated Parmesan Choice II. cover it with pesto sauce, sprinkled with pecans, served with rice and steamed kale Choice III.cover it with spaghetti sauce, sprinkles basil and feta Choice IV.cover it with pesto sauces, sprinkled with sunflower seeds, served with rice and sun-dried tomatoes Choice V.cover it with spicy tomato sauce, with fresh jalapeno, served with a fruit chutney\nRationales: We are looking for the best way to cook spaghetti squash. \nThe first word, many, is plural. So, more people find spaghetti squash to their taste than some people.\nIn addition, spaghetti squash is vegetable related and therefore an option would be some vegetable sauce.\nIf there are five options then we should take a look at them too \nChoice 1. cover it with tomatoes sauce, sprinkling on fresh basil, and serve with grated parmesan\nChoice 2. cover it with pisto sauce, sprinklings with pecans, accompanied by rice and steamed kales\nChoice 3. cover it with spaghetti ponto sauce, sprinklers of itching, and served with rice and squeezed dads\nChoice 4. cover it with pestos sauce, sprinkler with sunflower sees, served with rice and dried suns\nChoice 5. cover it with spicy tomatoes sauce, with fresh Jalapenos, served with a fruit cutlet\n\n\n### Analysis:\nFirst lets see there are 2 statements that we need to be answered.", "answer": " 400"}
{"text": "fly', is also irrelevant because it describes a situation in which an injured person who is also talented cannot perform, rather than a person who suffers from injury but is somehow able to perform.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energetic', do not fit either as anxiety is an emotional state and energy is a potential. \n6. Looking at the remaining answers, 'anxiety' best fits the context of the question, as it describes the negative emotion that someone might feel before performing.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: What did the child want to do during an extended afternoon? Choices:  a. sleep b. read c. eat d. play e. study\nRationales: The question asks about what the child would want to do during an afternoon. To answer this, consider the options and ask ourselves: if you could do anything during an extended afternoon, what would you want to do? The question doesn't give more information than that the child wants to do something on their own, but we need to pick an activity. Note that the question doesn't say the child wants to do anything with anyone or that they want to be entertained, which would narrow down our choice by eliminating the options that mention someone. \n\nChoices A, B, C, D, and E cover 5 different types of activities. It's likely that the child wants to choose one of them. We first consider Option A. One can read without sleeping, so it's not the correct option. Likewise, if you're going to sleep, there's no need to eat, so B is ruled out. Option C includes the word 'eat', but it also includes the word 'play', which rules out C. Option E includes the word'study'. However, what is it that we study most naturally in the afternoon? We nap? Read? Eat? Play? Study? The correct answer is what we want to do during an \"extended\" afternoon. That narrows our choices by eliminating those who do these things everyday, such as sleep, nap, and eat. If you're talking about study, it suggests something different, that it's an activity that people don't normally do in afternoons. Hence, the correct answer is Option D: play.\n\nAnswer: D: play\n\nInput: A", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": "flights', doesn't make sense as butterflies refer to emotions and injury is an injury. \n5. We can eliminate choice B as well as choice C, 'anxiety', because while anxiety could be a reservation about performing, it is a psychological issue, not a talent problem. \n6. Choice D, D: Happiness, describes what the answer is not, but doesn\u2019t relate to the person\u2019s talent. \n7. Choice E, \"Energetic\", doesn't fit either, as this answer implies the person in question does not lack the energy necessary to perform well. \n8. Choice D, \"Happiness\", fits best. \nAnswer: \tD:Happiness\n\nInput: While driving in the city, why might the driver not immediately see an intersection? Choices: \tA: Traffic B: Hidden C: Litter D: Light E: Crosswalk\nRationales:\t1. The question implies that a city driver may not immediately see an intersection. \n2. The choices can help us understand why this might happen. \n3.\t'Traffic', 'Hidden', 'Litter', and 'Light' are all reasons a driver might not immediately notice an intersection. \n4. 'Hidden', 'Litters' and 'Light\" are not necessary, as the intersection is already visible. \n5. 'Crosswalk' is also not necessary as an intersection is already in view. \n6. 'Litter' is possible but unnecessary. \t\n7. The intersection is already visible, so the driver should see it. \n8.\tAnswers B, D, and E are not possible reasons the driver may not notice the intersection: 'Hidden', 'Little', and 'Light', respectively, are already in the driver's field of vision and 'Crosswalk' does not seem to apply. \n9.\tThe only answer left is 'Hidden\". \n10. 'Hidden' is the option that seems to best fit the context. \n11.\t'Hidden' is the answer that the question is asking for.\nAnswer: \tHidden\n\nInput: If a person is very tall then what is that person probably wearing?

{"text": "fly', is an incorrect use of \"and\". We are not asking if talent persons suffer from or butterflies, but whether the person in question suffers from butterflies. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is also unrelated, as happy people do not necessarily have a problem with performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is not what is being described as the response. This person could be anxious about performing, but the question doesn't describe that, nor does this answer encompass it in full. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", does not describe the response either. It makes sense to be energetic when performing, but this person doesn't enjoy performing. \n8. In the end, we are left with two choices: 'anxiety' and 'injury'. \n9. While 'anxiety' could describe a person's condition, the root of the question is about the talent, and it is therefore likely that performing makes this person anxious. \n10. Therefore, the correct answer is B: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: What was the name of Marilyn Monroe's dog? Choices:  D D D C: Marmaduke B: Fifi C: Flick E: Mango\nRationales:  1. The question seeks the name of Marilu Monroe's dog.\n  2. Excluding answer choices that are not the names of Marilyn Monro's dog, \"Marmaduke\" appears to most closely resemble the dog name \"Marmaduke\". \n  3. Since there are only 5 letters in the name \"Marmadukee\" and there is no letter \"E\" in \"Mango,\" the answer would appear to be \"Maramaduke.\"\n  4. However, there are three dogs named \"Marmaduke,\" which are as follows: Marmaduke (from the comic strip), Marmaduke (the cartoon-strip dog turned movie), and Marma (Freddy Quinn's dog, later turned into the famous cartoon).\n  5. There is only one \"Mango\" that was owned by Marilyn Monroe, although there were a few others (most notably named \"Bow Wow", "answer": " 81"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't work, nor does the wording 'butterfly', which is not grammatically correct.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', do share a conceptual overlap with the task but are too broad, and as such should be eliminated. \n6. This leaves us with two viable answers: 'anxiety' or 'energetic'. \n7. 'Anxiety' and 'energetic' are both plausible options as each of them covers a possible emotional state related to performing. While it seems fair that a performer could be anxious or energetic, it's difficult to imagine someone being both at the same time. \n8. For this reason, the answer must be 'anxiety'. \nAnswer: A: anxiety\n\nInput: What would be the perfect gift for a friend who has everything? 3.Choices:  A: a day at the spa B: a movie ticket C: a romantic dinner D: a book E: a ticket to a baseball game\nRationales: This question is asking for a gift idea for a friend who already has everything. The other gift ideas do not make sense in relation as we're considering the friend to have everything. Thus, one needs to find a gift idea for a person who already has everything.\n\nAnswer: The only option that makes sense is B: a movie ticket.\n\nInput: If a plant requires a lot of sunlight, but the plant is indoors, what do I do?

{"text": "flys', also doesn't make sense as a talent isn't typically physical, more like psychological, unlike anxiety or injury, which refer to a mental state and physical trauma or malfunction respectively. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't relevant to the question, as the person may be happy in general but this does not necessarily affect their willingness to perform in talent-based performance art. \n6. Choice B, anxiety seems to be the most logical choice, as it best fits the context of psychological inhibitions and reservations about performing.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is choice C, anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: I was about to take a picture of something when at the last minute the dog decided to jump in my way, what could I have done to prepare for that? Choices: \tA: take three pictures at once instead of one B: tell my dog not to jump in my way C: put my phone in another room D: ask my dog for permission before taking picture of her E: do nothing - I needed to shoot the picture ASAP\nRationales:\t1. This question asks what solution the narrator can implement when the dog decides to block a picture being taken at the last minute. \n2. Among the provided choices, only A can be considered a complete solution to this circumstance, since B, C, D and E don't provide sufficient alternatives. \n3. By eliminating the other choices, A, the only potential solution left is B: take 3 pictures at once instead of 1. \n4. B is the best possible solution because this solution will address the context of the question by allowing the narrator to take multiple pictures in case the dog blocks the first one. \n5. The solution B is thus the best possible answer option available. \n6. Answer: Choice B - \u2018take three pictures, instead of one\u2019\n\nInput: My friend gave me a gift. I was so excited!

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense, as this phrase was intended to introduce Choice D, 'butterfly', into the context of Choice B. \n5. Choice B, could also be replaced with 'and talent persons cannot suffer from butterflies'. Again, this phrasing does not make sense, as we are discussing the talent person's feelings about performing, not their talent itself. \n6. Choice C, however, is relevant, and refers to anxiety related to performing.\n7. Thus, Choice C is the correct response.\nAnswer: C, anxiety\n\nInput: A dog, cat and a cow would be part of a farm? Choices:  B: yes D: no E: the zoo F: no animals are allowed\nRationales:\n1. The question is testing for comprehension of a topic where cows, chickens, and sheep etc. tend to be raised.\n2. Choice A and B are not valid options because farm is a general term that encompasses animals such as cats, dogs, cows and also plants that we don't typically associate with farms.\n3. Choices C and E are obviously invalid because a zoo includes many species, not only cats, dogs or cattle.\n4. Choices D and F are also invalid because a dog or cow (or any other animal) can be raised for meat or other products and may not necessarily be living at a farm at any given time.\n5. Choices A, B and F can be disregarded because they are not relevant to the question. We know that there are cats, dogs, and cows on farms because they would likely be among the livestock that is being raised at that farm. \n6. We rule out Choice D because it's talking about the fact that a dog, cat, and cow can't be part of a zoo. We want something that is true about all farms, especially ones that are currently raising meat in order to consume them.\n7. The answer choice that most aligns with what we're looking for is therefore Choice B, yes.\nAnswer: B: Yes\n\n#### 7.

Choices C, D, and E, 'anxiety', 'happiness' and 'energy', respectively, don't make sense either because someone with these feelings wouldn't experience the same reservation as someone without anxiety, happiness or energy.\n6. One remaining possibility is the statement that someone who is not able to perform may suffer from injury or butterfly. This would not normally reflect someone's psychological feelings of happiness, anxiety or energy, making Choice A, 'talent', make sense.\n7. Therefore the best answer is A: talent.\nAnswer: A. talent\n\nInput: The movie company that had the most tickets sold to the movie theater was which one?

Choices:  a: is easy to find b: is not dangerous c: is available all year d: can be studied inside e: costs more than 2,297,868\nRationales: The question asks for a choice on the answer that would explain why an animal is 'the best organism to study', given that it can be studied in a lab. \n1. As the question provides the amount of money necessary to buy an animal (costing more than 2, 297, 868), we know that it isn't about price. \n2. Because they mention the lab, we understand that the choice is about an animal that can be studied 'in' a lab, not 'out in the wild'. \n3. The other answers are all given reasons to why a certain animal would be the best to study, therefore 'explain why an animal is the *best* organism to study'\n\n### Demostration:\nInput", "answer": " 1600"}
{"text": "hlies', could be an issue due to the placement of the comma, creating a grammatical issue with the phrasing. \n5. Choice E, could be a plausible answer due to the description that the person doesn't particularly enjoy performing, but this isn't necessarily an affirmative answer to the question. \n6. As Choices B and E are ruled out, Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', are the only viable answers as they would fit the description that the person does not enjoy performing.\n7. Of these, Choice C, 'anxiety', seems to align more closely with the personality trait of the subject as this person already possesses a talent and is having doubts about whether or not to perform. \n8. Therefore, it may seem reasonable to choose Choice C, 'Anxiety', as a viable answer. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: A baby was learning how to crawl and fell off the couch, what did the baby learn? Choices: 1 A: babies should never fall off the couch 2 B: fall is not a fun place to be 3 C: babies fall off sofas regularly 4 D: learning is essential 5 E: babies shouldn't put the on their own Choices: 6 A: babies can get up by themselves 7 B: crawling is tricky 8 C: it's easy to fall 9 D: babies shouldn\u2019t walk until they're three 10 E: walk without any help \nRationales: The question asks the baby what it learned when it fell off the couch. \n1. We know that babies can put themselves back on when they fall off or can get picked back up by another person.\n2. There is no benefit to this.\n3. Babies fall off couches, tables, chairs, you know, all the time.\n4. We always learn when we fall.\n5. It is not necessary.\n6. Babies that can walk unassisted are those who have learned how.\n7.

{"text": "fly', refers to the nervous feelings experienced by performing artists, an allusion that doesn't align with a more literal interpretation of the question.\n5. Choices C and D, 'worry' and 'happiness' respectively, don't fit either, as anxiety and happiness aren't the issue at hand.\n6. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the person suffers from anxiety or related mental health issues, and that this is likely to manifest as a desire to not perform. \n7. The only choice left that fits the description is Choice E, 'feeling uneasy', as this connotes anxiety and is also a possible mental health diagnosis and not a physical one.\nAnswer: D.\n\nInput: What do people use to keep their hair shiny and healthy? Choices: A. Conditioner B. Hair cut C. Spiky D. Gels E. Hair dye\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about how to keep one's hair shiny and health.\n2. Choice E, \"Hair Dye\" does not explain how to keep hair healthy or shiny, and instead just explains how to make hair a certain color.\n\nChoice D, \"Gel\", is used to help hold hair in place and create a certain look, but it does not explain how to make one's hair shinier or healthier.\n\n\n\n\n\nChoice B, \"Haircut\", means to cut someone's hair, and it also does not go into detail on how one's hair can be made shinier or healthy.\n\nChoice A, \"Conditioner\", is another answer that describes a product that helps hair look healthier, shinier, etc., when used in conjuncture with other products.\n\nThis implies that Choice A, \"Conditioner\" is the most likely answer, as it is the only one of the answer choices that goes into detail on how to care for and benefit your hair.", "answer": " 130"}

A: the game takes hours to complete 7. A: this does no apply as there are many reasons to play on a device Choices: B: the controls are better 8. A: a handheld device is better for a portable experience 9. A: the handheld device can be used as a gaming controller for a console 10. A: the game doesn't take long to play\nRationales: What is the question asking that can be broken down into two parts. 1. Why would one prefer to one console than a portable. 2. What are the benefits of playing on a console verses a handheld device. \n1. Look at each option to see which best fits the question. \n2. Option 1, 'Cheaper', does not directly relate to the question as portability is more focused on convenience. \n3. Option 2, 'looks better', is too general and does not mention advantages related to portable. \n4. Option 3, 'play with others', does not relate to play on a portable device as it implies having access to others outside of your home. \n5. Option 4, 'has better graphics', is also more general than relevant and relates to both console and portable. \n6.

Choices A: the dog B: the cat C: the kitten D: the chihuahua\nRationales:1. The question is about the stars of a show. It is asking which star of the show was the _biggest_ star. \n2. To eliminate possibilities, we can start by determining that the biggest star would generally be a dog. This is the most popular type of domestic cat. Therefore, the two stars we can eliminate are a cat and a chihuahua. \n3. We can next combine \"dog\"/\"the star of the show\" and \"cat/chihuahua\"/\"a huge hit\" into \"the dog or the cat\", to eliminate these possibilities. \n4. It is also possible that \"the dog or the kitten\" can be used to eliminate the possibility of the dog or the chihuahuahua. 5. However, we must consider another possibility that we can eliminate from this new list \u2014 the kitten. Therefore, we need to combine \"dog\"/\"star of the show\" with \"kitten\"/\"a huge hit\". \n6. If we instead use \"kitten\"/\"the kitten\", we can eliminate an additional possibility \u2014 cat. \n7. When we eliminate the possibilities from those two new list, our final set of possibilities is just between \"dog\" or \"kitten\". \n8. Therefore, dog or kitten is the correct answer because we can easily combine \"the dog and the kitten\" or \"the kitten and the dog\" into one list to eliminate possibilities. \nAnswer: C, dog\n\nInput: The doctor used a stethoscope to listen to the patient heartbeat.

Secondly, even if someone had an injury, which they didn't in this case, they wouldn't necessarily suffer from it. \n5. Choice E, happiness, is not relevant either because happiness does not equate to a reservation about performing, nor does it necessarily mean a person does not like performing. \n6. Now, let's take a closer look at the last two choices, which are the ones that remain. \n7. Choice, D, has the word 'anxiety' in it, a feeling of fear, worry or uneasiness, which does fit in context and could reasonably be related to someone not liking performing.\n8. Choice, E, has 'butterflies' in it, which is an idiom meaning uncertainty, which again could related to not liking performing. \n9. Therefore, because anxiety and butterflies could be related to a person not liking performing, this must result from a psychological difficulty rather than a physical one.\n10. Therefore, the answer must be Choice D: Anxiety.\nAnswer: D, anxiety\n\nInput: What do people who are afraid of going to the dentist share with those who aren't afraid? Choices: 1.

{"text": "fly', also does not fit \u2013 while a butterfly is a sensation felt in the stomach, it has no relevance to the issue at hand.\n5. Choices C, D, and E are not relevant because they do not provide insight into talent. \n6. Ultimately, the only pertinent choices are Choice B where the performer likely suffers from some form of anxiety, or Choice E, where the performer likely struggles due to 'butterfly feelings' or 'nerves'.\n7. Comparing the two, the answer makes an 'x doesn't feel comfortable performing because of' argument. \n8. Therefore, Choice E, 'energetic', does not make sense as a performer would likely want to draw on the energy the song might evoke and not express an unwillingness to participate. \n9. Hence, this leaves Choice C, 'nervous', implying the performer struggles with a form of anxiety. \n10. Therefore, the correct answer is Choice C, 'anxiousness'.\nAnswer: C: anxiousness\n\nInput: I\u2019m about to make a presentation at school, but it looks like I\u2019ve forgotten all of my slides.

The main idea of the question is about making a presentation at school, so we can't choose any irrelevant information. We also can't choose multiple information from one sentence. Because the person forgot the slides, he can read the slide's information when he presents.\n2. We can narrow down our answer from the options for the person to choose.\n3.

Evolutionists are scientists, and like the other scientists, they classify the universe using math. It does not indicate their specific approach to classification. \n3) Languages are subject to opinion, and therefore cannot be objectively used to classify the universe.\n4) The answer can be interpreted to classify the universe or, on the other hand, to classify eye-witness experiences regarding the universe.

{"text": "fly', doesn't align with the question either, so we can dismiss its possibility. \n5. Furthermore, we know that butterflies are positive feelings, so it's clear this choice doesn't work either.\n6. We can also eliminate Choice C as 'anxiety' is a feeling of apprehension, so it doesn't fit the task, as 'having anxiety' is not an indicator of lacking a talent.\n7. Next, Choice D, 'happiness', isn't relevant as we are looking for an inhibiting fear or obstacle. \n8. Finally, we can eliminate Choice E as 'energetic' means 'full of energy'. Thus, a person who is 'energetic' is not 'fearful' as the question proposes.\n9.

Choices:  C: cut A: scissors B: sheet D: pen E: stick\nRationales: The question asks which of the above answer options does not need to be separated from the paper during cutting.\nThe first step when cutting paper is choosing a tool for the job. To get a clear picture, we can think of a set of tools and what their functions are.\n\nThe following choices can be rejected directly without further consideration.\n'A', 'cut', is not a tool, so it cannot be chosen.\n'B', is 'a sheet', not 'for the job', so it cannot be chosen\n'D', 'a pen', is neither for the job nor can be separated from paper, so it cannot be a potential choice.\nThus, choices C and E need to be rejected.\n\nNow, we can focus on A, C, and E.\n'C','scissors', is a tool and it can be a choice, so the answer choice is not C.\n'A', is a'set of tools', not 'for the work'. Therefore, it cannot be chosen. Finally, we are left with E, 'a stick'. It's a stick and it can be used to separate paper from paper. Thus, the answer choice is E.\nAnswer: E\nThe answer choice is A: '", "answer": " 72"}

Even if someone were talented at performing, there is no way to exclude the possibility that they still suffer from minor injuries due to the physical activity involved in performing. \n5. Choice D, happiness, means to feel glad, pleased or satisfied, and does not refer to any specific emotion. \n6. Choice D, anxiety, is the mental state of uneasiness and worry about a future event or situation occurring. This answers can refer to the emotions, anxiety can refer to the mental state of nervousness. \n7. Choice E, energy, is a force that makes things move from one place to another or makes things happen, usually in scientific terms, but could also mean enthusiasm and excitement. \n8. Finally, choice D, anxiety, can also relate to emotions due to anxiety. Emotions are a feeling of happiness or excitement, but a feeling related to anxiety, fear or terror. \n9. Therefore, it is safe to say that options D and E can be eliminated from the choices as they do not match the given description.\n10. Since our choices are left with A and C, we can start to further clarify their specific meanings in relation to our question.\n11. Choice A, injury, is an illness or harm caused by an impact or other action, typically that causes physical damage. \n12. Choice B, talent persons cannot suffer from 'injury and butterflies', does not make sense. Butterflies could be a reference to nerves and a talent person could not suffer from injury, but they might also suffer from anxiety. The text states that someone might suffer from 'anxiety', which is related to emotions. \n13. Therefore, we can eliminate choice B, Talent persons cannot suffer from an injury and butterflying. \n14. We are left with choice A, injury. This seems like the best answer because it fits with the original problem question, but doesn't directly mean anxiety.\n15.

Choices: A: her opinion on what makes a good college student B: what it's like to be a college student C: college life D: her teaching philosophy E: what she does in her free time\nRationales: The question asks what the final project should be, and implies that the professor should be making the decision.\n1. Looking at the options given, we can easily rule out choices A B C D E as they all give reasons why the final project should have a particular focus.\n2. Choice A, \"Opinion on what makes a good student\" requires some further investigation.\n3. It could be that the professor is deciding on the final project and her colleague is giving an opinion on it, but it could also be that she was asking about the colleague's opinion on what makes a college student good, and the question was answered by the colleague.\n4. The phrasing of the question is slightly unclear and, without further clarification, it is difficult to definitively determine which one of these meanings is being expressed.\n5. As \"What does your colleague think a good college student is\" also fits the context of the question, we can eliminate this choice too.\n6. Choices B C D - do not give a specific topic for the project, so we can eliminate them.\n7. We are thus left with option E, \u201cWhat does your colleague do in her free time?\u201d\n8. As this is something the professor is unlikely to know or want to know, we can eliminate it as well. So, the best choice is A, \"Her opinion on what makes a\u2026\"\nAnswer: A: Her opinion on what makes", "answer": " 121"}
{"text": "fly', implies that there is a rule disallowing performing artists to suffer from injury or butterflies (anxiety). \n5. Although the butterfly in this case can refer to an anxious feeling due to performance anxiety, the rule is still incorrect as it contradicts that talent persons could be injured while performing if needed. \n6. So, we can disregard this option.\n7. The rest of the choices do not make logical sense as well. \n8. Choice E, an 'energetic' person does not fit because being energetic has nothing to do with not wanting to perform. \n9. Choice D, a 'happiness' person does not fit. Happiness has a relationship with talent, but it is not the reason a talent person does or does not want to perform. \n10. Choice C, an 'anxiety' person does not make sense either because anxiety is related to performing, not related to talent.\n11.

Choice B, anxiety, refers to a specific type of emotional state, and makes sense, but it could refer to any type of psychological anxiety, and without stating what the person actually has (in this case, anxiety about performing or about being obligated to performing). \n7. Choice C, talents, does have a vaguely matching meaning but it does not refer to a psychological phenomenon. \n8.

Choices:  G: It means they don't have to do anything that is not associated with other people.  A: They don't like being alone.  C: They always need to be surrounded by other people.  B: They prefer it.  E: They do not want to be isolated or alone.\nRationales: Considering the choices, it is clear that we can eliminate G as we don't require any description of what people are always doing, nor do we need to consider whether their activities relate to others or themselves alone.\nFor B and E, it is clear that the person enjoys being alone, which is the opposite of the original sentence.\nFor C, the person isn't necessarily around others \u2013 they would need companions to be around. Therefore, it is the best choice to consider.\n\nInput: If you are feeling bored, what is the best way to overcome this emotion? Choices:  Dishonestly A: lie B: talk to others C: sleep E: avoid activity.\nRationales:: 1. If you're in a situation of being bored, which option is the most effective? 2. In such a context, lying to others is not only socially unacceptable but ineffective in alleviating boredom.\n3. Sleeping may be an effective method to alleviate boredom, but it is not necessarily applicable to every situation.\n4. Similarly, talking to others may alleviate boredness. It is not necessarily the best approach unless appropriate individuals are available.\n5. Avoiding activity is the method that best fits the criteria, as it allows for boredom to be overcome by continuing to stay busy.\n\nInput: Which is the best synonym for \"mystery\"?

A: excitement 2. B: romantic dinner 3. C: misunderstanding 4. D: wedding crash 5. E: honeymoon stage\nRationales: For (1), A: \"Excitement\" is not a good metaphor, the metaphor requires using a water element. In addition, the word \"excitement\" only means feelings, not water, and one might not be feeling feelings in this situation. The word \"excitement\", when used without other words like \"romantic\" would make it sound more like \"exciting\", meaningful, or meaningful. (2) B: a romantic dinner means an \"evening\", \"night\", or \"day\" meal with someone you love/like. 3) C: \"Misunderstanding\" is not a good choice because the word \"misunderstanding\" is used to describe a person's misinterpretation of another person. The word \"honeymoon\" is used here instead as the phrase is used to describe people's relationship for the first time, in a more romantic and happy way. 4. D: \"Wedding Crash\" is not a good fit to use for a person's \"personal\" celebration.

Looking at choice E: 'happiness', happiness, although a possible emotion, isn't specifically related to anxiety.\n7. We thus can eliminate these options from the choice list. \n8. Option C: 'Anxiety' is a reasonable and accurate answer as the person is describing a fear of performing as a result of their talent.\n9. Option D: We can further determine that \"Energetic\" refers to physical activity, so \"energy\" is indeed a possibility. We will need to use clues to determine which of the two options is more common. \n10. Looking further at the question, it talks of \"a talent\", so the more likely option is \"having a talent\".\n11.

Choices:  a: 12 hours b: 24 hours 25 hours 24-48 hours c: 28 days d: A month and a half e: 3 months\nRationales: Choice A: a: 12-hours has the word \"feel\" in it. Feeling is a symptom of when someone is sick, so it doesn't make sense to describe sickness from the point of view of feelings for a long duration such as 12-hurs.\nChoice B: 25-hours sounds very similar to the word \"feel\". Feeling and sickness might be related as they are both symptoms, but even if the sickness could cause someone to \"feel\" sick, they would still not describe a duration as long as 25-hurs. \nChoice C: 24-47 hours is very long, but the context of the question is about sickness.

The question is a riddle that asks why a number is not always an answer to an equation. \n\n\n### Answer:\nIn math, a number is never the answer to an equation because the answer to the equation should be a literal representation of the number.

Furthermore, it would be an issue affecting more than just a person's inability to play games. \n2. Choice B, sickness, could be a possible reason for the question if the game in question required physical exertion but it would apply to anyone sick rather than just the person in question.\n3. Choices C and B may be relevant to the question, but they are too specific or do not provide a general reason.\n4. Choices B and D are plausible answers to the question, but Choice D, physical disability, is better suited as it allows for the most general interpretation.\n5. It follows that the best answer is choice E: none of these.\nAnswer:E:none of these\n\nInput: What was the fastest way for a person to finish their science class worksheet?

{"text": "flies', indicates that performing is not the source of the fear of performing, which is what's being implied.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'a happy one or two', are closely related to performing, and are not a good fit since the question clearly indicates not enjoying performing.\n6. Choices E, 'energetic', is the opposite of an issue with performing, so it's also an incorrect answer.\n7. The choice that best fits the question is Choice B: Anxiety, as it is the most relevant of the provided choices, since this word refers to a mental issue as opposed to a physical one. It can also take on various forms. \n8. Therefore, we can conclude the best answer is Choice B: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following is the most effective remedy for a stomach ache? Choices:  Choices: A: warm water B: a warm shower C: warm hug D: tea  E: water\nRationales: Considering what the question has said, it is suggested that the best option would be the most effective remedy. However, there are other considerations that should be thought of such as the comfort the method provides such as the given choices are warm water, warm shower, warm hug, tea, and water. The most effective remedy may not be the most comfortable or the most convenient.\n2. Water should not be an option since it lacks an appropriate remedy effect.\n3. Hugging someone warmly is a way of providing comfort. However, warm water, warm showers, and hot tea are also some ways of comforting oneself when having one's stomach affected.\n4. Taking water in can also offer aid, but it should not be on the question for the sole reason that there might be a more effective choice that is not in the list.\n5. Taking a warm shower can make one feel relaxed at whatever point they want due to flexibility in time. In contrast, one cannot control the timing of warm hug, tea or water depending on which options they choose.\n\n6. Having hugged someone you will need some time to relax and do nothing before you can go or engage in other activities. The time it takes will eventually give way to other things.", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": "fly', is not even the correct syntax of a sentence in English. \n5. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, would be a fitting response if the person was afraid of performing because they were suffering from anxiety. \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, fits the right description, as the person disliking performing would probably suffer from anxiety. 7.

Tiger E. Snake\n\nRationales:\n1. The question states that the person who was born in \"the year of the tiger\" is what.\n2. Choice A, \"caterpillar,\" is unlikely an appropriate response given that the question is referring to an animal.\n3. Choices B and C, \"rabbit\" and \"cat\", respectively, are both animals but are incorrect answers because the question asks about a person's animal symbol and not a real-world representation.\n4. Choices D and E, \"tiger\" and \"snake,\" are both correct potential answers.\n5. Thus, \"D\" is the right answer.\nAnswer: D. Tiger\n\nInput: Which element in the periodic table is found in both carbon dioxide and chlorine? Choices:\nA. Phosphorus B. Flourine C. Iodine D. Mercury E. Chlorine\n\nRationales\n1. The question wants to which element of the periodic table is found or \"contained\" in carbon dioxide and \"chlorine.\"\n2. Elements are contained or found in substances via a chemical process.\n3. In chemistry, we know that chlorine is highly reactive and combines with carbon to form carbon dioxide.\n4. Thus, the right answer is element C: iodine.\nAnswer: E.

Choices: A: a knob B: a brain C: a good sense of humor D: both talents and skills E: talent\nRationales: Looking at the given example sentence, it's clear the person is being praised for his or her skill, so it makes sense to look for the answer that best represents skill.\n1. Choice A, \"a knob\" seems unlikely. It's not the sort of term we would use to convey or describe skill. \n2. Choice B, \"a brain\", seems out of place; we don't typically attribute brainpower to someone's lack of skill. \n3. Both Choice C, \"a good sense of humor\", and Choice D, \"both talents and skills\" don't directly relate to what the answer should be. \n4. Therefore, the best possible answer is Choice E, \"talent\".\nAnswer: E: Talent\n\nInput: If Johnny fell through the window of his room, we could reasonably assume he was?\nChoices A: having an adventure B: sleeping C: dreaming D: awake E: standing on the window sill\nRationales: Given the context, the answer would be A. If John fell through the window, it is safe to assume he was having an adventure, because you're unlikely to fall into a room when you're doing something else.\nIf he was sleeping, you most likely wouldn't expect him to fall out of the window. If he was dreaming, you'd probably expect him to stay in the same position. If", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "fly' doesn't fit because of the use of \"and\" rather than \"or\" which means that an \"injury\" and a \"butterfly\" can occur independent of each other. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't fit since a person who is happy can still be anxious or show other symptoms of anxiety.\n6. Choices C, \"a talent\", doesn't fit as that \"a\" is a definite article which indicates \"talent\" is a specific type, but there are many types. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't fit since \"energetic\" is an adjective which can be applied to other conditions, such as the noun \"person\", which it modifies.\n8. This leaves us with two possible answers that could be construed as true: \"C: anxiety\" and \"D: happiness\".\n9. But since we know from the information given that this individual may suffer from anxiety, it's fair to presume that they would not be truly happy, so we can disregard \"D: happiness\". \n10. Therefore, \"C: anxiety\", remains as the most accurate answer.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: When an individual feels hungry, they crave certain foods.

When an individual feels hungr, they crave certain types of food.\n2. It is possible that sweet-taste preferences and food types are connected.\n3. The choice of answer can be broken down by first understanding the different types of foods and then understanding the meaning of the word appetizing. \n4. Looking at the options presented, we find there are four food types with distinct flavor profiles that are also common sources of nutrients. \n5. The first food type is candy, which includes sweets, chocolates, soft drinks and toffees, which contain high levels of added sugar. \n6.

Anxiety is a fear, worry, or uneasiness that typically relates to performance. Being anxious would be the best fit.\n8. Therefore we can choose the answer: C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: A person who knows a lot of information about a topic in not necessarily intelligent. Choices:  A B C D E\nRationales: There are many people who know a lot about one topic, but are not smart.\n1. Choices A, B, C, D, and E are all possible outcomes, but there is ultimately one correct answer.\n2. Looking at Choices A, we see that \"these people\" is defined as \"one, some, or all [of] them\". \n3. This is a broad category, but it doesn't address the possibility that a smart person who knows one subject is not intelligent.\n4. Looking at Choice B, \"smart people\" is definitely the correct answer.\n5. This is a very broad category, but it covers the idea that a person who knows a lot isn't necessarily smart.\n6. Looking at Choice C, \"no one\" is the correct answer since no one is a person, and the question specified that we are looking for a single person. \n7. Considering Choice D, \"not all of them\" refers to all of the people whom A, B, or C describe, not a subset of these people. \n8. Choice E, \"none of them\" doesn't make sense because \"them\" refers to one, some, or all of them, which in some cases may contain intelligent or smart people.\n9.

{"text": "fly', indicates that if someone is 'talented', they cannot be injured by butterflies. This doesn't make sense in the context given, as a 'talent' would be irrelevant to the concept of being harassed by bugs. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is also unlikely as we know there are different types of talent and 'happiness' is not an aspect that relates to performance art. \n6. Choice B, \"talent persons cannot suffer...\" is also irrelevant.\n7. Choices C and E are both psychological states (depression, anxiety, etc.), and don't specifically address whether the person 'likes' to perform or not.\n8. Choice C, \u201canxiety\", describes a state of mind that someone might have when they are in the process of performing, so it makes sense that the person doesn't like performing.\n9. Alternatively, Choice E, \u201cenergetic\u201d, does not reflect anything about the situation given as it simply references a state of mind in which to perform.\n10.

Choice A, \"no food,\" makes no sense as \"no food\" will always be the situation the man is in after having his leg removed, if that is all he could eat in the future. 2. Choice B, a \"sandwich,\" doesn't make sense because \"sandwiches\" are associated with lunch or an \"on the go\" snack, and not with dinner. 3. Choice C, \"a cup of water,\" is a reasonable answer as water can be consumed many times throughout a day. 4. Choice D, a \"pizza,\" isn't a reasonable answer as \"pizza\" would be associated with being able to use one's hands, whereas he would not have his leg anymore. 5", "answer": " 55"}

I\u2019m not even sure what a real estate agent is  I\u2019d prefer to speak to someone in person. It seems odd to hire a real estate agent to sell a house when your family is not there to enjoy it. I\u2019ll find my next home without the help of a real estate agent. I definitely want to use a real estate agent because he or she does the hard thinking for me.  A real estate agent\u2019s job is to sell your house but I am very happy in my old house and do not want to make a huge change.\nRationale: 1. The context of the text indicates that you have or might have a family, so you are considering looking for a bigger house than your current one. \n2. The question is asking whether you should use a real estate agent or use it yourself. \n3. Consider the context and structure of the choices again. All of the options except C do not fit with the specific meaning of the word 'use'. \n4. C fits with the words 'hire', 'use' and'sale', implying that you are going to use the services of real estate agent to help you sell a house. \n5. So, C is the most correct choice. It has the correct vocabulary; it matches with the context and structure of questions.\nAnswer: C is the most correct.\n\nInput: Dmitri has been in jail for the past 6 years.

But again, the emphasis is on reservation around performance \u2013 which is clearly not what happiness or energy entails.\n6. Therefore, the option we are looking for is one that is not related to happiness and energy. \n7. Considering Choice D, 'anxiety', is a psychological state that could describe a person who is less than confident or talented and doesn't necessarily enjoy performing. \n8.

The question is about the advantages of a healthy diet, specifically when young. \n2. The options are A: healthy, B: fun, C: strong, and D: less expensive, so that we can eliminate ones that are not related.\n3. Choices A and D are related to a healthy diet but are not specific to children. \n4. It's clear that what the question wants is a benefit relating more to children. \n5. Looking at Choice C, healthy diet is something a child can do, and is thus a good choice for the question. \n6. The other answer is one that a child can enjoy. And by making it fun, a child is more likely to eat healthy. \n7. So, this is the correct answer: C: \"it is more fun\"\nAnswer: C: \"it's more fun\"\n\nInput: Which fruit is red?

Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', are relevant, but we should note that anxiety is a negative feeling which conflicts with the idea of someone not liking a performance. \n6. Choice D, happiness, is not an emotional feeling related to performing, so it cannot be what the person in question suffers from.\n7. Choose option E, 'energetic', because it is an adjective that describes a feeling that may be both good and bad, and does not need to be related to a performance.\n8.

Answer A) does nothing - patients are already sick. If the doctor does nothing, we should already have healthy patients.\n5. Answer B) do exam - Examinations are to find the reason in which the patient is sick. They do not treat the sickness.\n6. Answer C) cure. The doctors cure patients. We should not have sick patients.\n7. Answer E) sick person - if there is a sick person, the doctor must help them. Therefore, we need an answer that describes treatment or help.\n8. The answer is D) cure someone. The doctor does nothing because he is already helping the patient.  Now that we have chosen a good answer, we should eliminate the rest of the answers left.\n9. We know that cure someone (answer D) is helping someone. In the context of a sick patient, that could mean giving medicine or providing medical attention.

{"text": "fly', doesn't have anything to do with why someone may suffer from the feeling of anxiety or stress. \n5. Choice B, however, does make sense, as it suggests that talent is an inborn trait, making talent persons less likely to be stressed about performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, however, does not make sense as, again, anxiety is about the mind and feelings, not about talent. \n7. Choice E, energetic, also does not make sense, as being energetic and performing are not necessarily related. \n8. Choice D, happiness, does make sense as a person can feel less happy about performing because they may not enjoy the art itself, or because they are anxious about performing, thus leading to feeling unhappy. \n9.

{"text": "fly', does not make sense as there is no sense of consistency and logic from the wording. \n5. Changing, it would be \"talent people cannot suffer from injury and nerves\". \n6. Therefore, the logical flow of the sentence suggests that Choice E, 'nerves,' doesn't make sense as 'nerves' would specifically relate to anxiety. \n7. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, is likely to be the answer since it's the opposite of the sense of energy given in the last sentence. \n8. Further, it would be contradictory to say that someone has talent but also has anxiety, as talent is an attribute that is generally desirable. \n9.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect as it implies that people with great talent do not suffer from injury or butterflies. \n5. Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, is incorrect as someone can be happy and still have reservations about performing. \n6. Choice C, \u2018anxiety\u2019, is incorrect as anxiety can affect people who love performing as well.\n7. Choices E, 'energy', and D, 'happiness', are too general, not specific to the performance area. \n8. We can't ignore Choice B, 'anxiety'. Given the person's description, it makes sense to look more closely at this possibility. \n9. By looking at choice B and considering the question, we know someone with talent but reservations about performing might have apprehension about performing. \n10. There is also the likelihood of apprehension in people who aren't very talented, so we can eliminate choice B as a possibility based on this factor.\n11.

Choices: 25, 52, 29, 53, 39, 70\nRationales: To determine the answer to the question 'What is the sum of 8 + 3 *7?', break down the calculation to get the correct answer. The addition operation '+' represents the total amount of a mathematical calculation. The multiplication operation '*' tells us that the calculation represents a times operation.\n1. First, we need to determine what operation corresponds to each number in the equation. To do this, look at the operation symbols to find the one corresponding to the number.\n2. When faced with an addition equation, you want to find the total of each sum. '+,' represents the total amount of addition and will only apply to addition or subtraction.\n3. '(3 * 7),' is a multiplication operation that equals '7. Since there is a multiplication operation, only multiplication and division can be done. The operation representing 7 is to multiply.

Choices:  C: cat D: dog E: elephant F: fly\nRationales: This question is very straightforward once you understand the rules of English grammar and vocabulary.\nA noun is a word that is usually used to identify a person, place, animal, object, thing, quality or idea. So, the answer to this is \"Elephant\" for sure.\n\"Cat\" can be a noun, but is it specifically? No, It is a noun here and you can confirm it by looking for:\nA proper noun: A proper noun is a noun that is a specific person, place, animal or object such as \"Bear\" or \"Hamburg\", but is not a simple noun such as \"cat\", \"dog\", or \"chair\".\nAn abstract noun: An abstract noun is a nonspecific representation of a specific thing such as \"sense\", \"truth\", or \"intelligence\".\nAn adjective: An adjective is a modified noun or pronoun such as \"smart\", \"tall\" or \"huge\".\nA number: A number is a noun that represents a specific quantity such as a single or multiple of something like \"one\" or \"42\" or \"12\". However, there are numbers that are not considered nouns because they don't represent a singular and quantifiable thing like \"infinity\" or \"number\". The same rules apply to nouns that aren't numbers are not considered a noun because they indicate a singular, quantifiable thing.\nSo, \"Fly\" is neither of these things because it's an indefinite pronoun and just a part of a larger noun \"flies\".\nThis is important because it is usually a bad strategy to consider all words in the word to be a noun and then pick the word that is not a noun in a word with nouns in it, such as:\n\"", "answer": " 43"}

{"text": "fly', is also not correct because there is no rule against talented people suffering from injury and butterfliesss, we're not stating a logical contradiction.\n5. Choices C and E 'anxiety' and 'eager, are potential possibilities depending on the individual, but they are not universal truths. They are also not a direct conflict with 'not enjoy performing'. \n6. We can thus eliminate Choices C, D, and E as being possible answers given the context in the question.\n7. Choices B and A are thus the only remaining possible answer as they do not conflict with the statement that the individual is talented but does not enjoy performing, and they would have to be an issue in which case they cannot be performed.\n8. Therefore if someone is talented but doesn't like doing their performance talent, they likely suffer from a mental issue, such as anxiety, as this would limit or prevent them from performing.\n9. The answer is then either A or B. \n10. While we should always choose the best possible answer and not one that is merely plausible, we can pick either answer and choose which is better. \n11. We can choose A, however, we are not confident that 'anxiety' is actually the cause of the person's problem. It could also be 'energetic'. After all, if someone is excited about their performance, they may enjoy performing, even if it does make them anxious before. \n12. Alternatively, if we wanted to be confident that we had the correct answer, we could always rework the conclusion by using a modifier when describing the individual's suffering: 'likely', 'probably' and 'perhaps'. This makes the conclusion more tentative and thus more logical. \n13. The conclusion is then \"If someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, either they are anxious or they are probably energetic.\"\n14.

Choices C, 'anxiety', and B, 'butterflies', are likely a reflection of what the person doesn't want to experience while performing rather than what they want to experience, thus, this can be eliminated.\n7. This leaves us with Choice A, 'anxiety'. \n8. For our final consideration, we can go back and recheck the wording of the questions. \n9. The phrase \"with what\" would imply that the answer would be an actual state or feeling and that it would correspond to a'suffering' from that state or feeling. \n10. Anxiety fits best, as it is a common feeling associated with people suffering when being faced with a difficult task, such as performing. \n11. Therefore, the most suitable response is Choice B, 'anxiety.'\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: What kind of animal is a bear? Choices:  a: a bear b: a polar bear  c: a sloth  d: a mammal  e: a shark\nRationales: If someone is a bear who is? A. A bear. B. A polar bear. C. A sloth. D. A mammal. E. A shark.\nRationales: A. There is only one bear. There are many sharks, but if we are only choosing bears then this can't be a shark.\nRationale: B. there is a lot of bears in the world, but there is only one polar bear, and polar bears are found in the arctic so this can be the best answer. If bear=grizzly bear.\nRationales, C: there can\u2019t be many sloths.\nD. If bear=golden bear,\n\nInput: How many people are there?

{"text": "flys', is a grammatical error that indicates that this person is not actually a 'talent person', making it irrelevant to the question. \n5. Choice D, happiness does not fit here because there is no mention of happy people not liking to perform. \n6. Therefore, we are left with Choices C and E. \n7. Choice C, ''I feel anxious all the time'', describes a psychological implication that suggests a person is anxious even when they do not express it. 'Anxious' is an emotion which would imply a lack of confidence or even nervousness, something one might experience as a result of fearfulness.  \n8. Choice E, ''I'm happy all the time'' is a similarly invalid option as it suggests that the individual is a happy person, contradicting the premise stated in the question which implies that they aren't. \n9. Therefore, option C, anxiety, best describes this scenario.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: I was looking for a new car and I came across one with a good price and a good deal. How would I describe the price and deal to a friend? Choices:  a: cheap price and a great deal b: low offer and awesome offer c: affordable and inexpensive deal d: discounted and a good deal f: lower price and good deal\nRationales: the question is about how a good price and good deal can be described to a friend.\n1. We can eliminate choice A because it's not grammatically correct. \n2. We can eliminate choices C and D because we'll get to a better answer soon. \n3. We can eliminate all the rest except B and F.\n4. We can see that it's possible to use the words \"great\" or \"good\", but both \"great\" and \"good\" are overused and might not catch the attention of our friend. \n5. We can also see choices B and F use the words \"low offer\" and \"discounted\" instead of the terms \"good\" and \"cheap\" to describe a discount deal. These terms can be used to describe what we actually experienced.\n6. Choices B and F are correct answers.\nAnswer: B, F\nInput: Which of the following words is the correct spelling of the", "answer": " 34"}
{"text": "fly,' doesn't make a lot of sense as a talent is typically a positive thing \u2013 butterflies could be seen as a positive emotion in some situations, but not a permanent reservation.\n5. Choices C and E, 'anxiety and anxiety,' are not helpful since both are emotions that could contribute to a person's choice to not perform. \n6. Choice D, \"Happiness,\" is unrelated to a talent. \n7. Finally, choice D, 'Energetic', is also unrelated because \"Energetic\" is a type of energy, so its presence or absence does not signify a reservation about performing.\n8. Looking at all the other choices, we know the answer is most likely 'anxiety', in the following rationale:\n9. A person can be talent and suffer from anxiety at the same time.\n10. Anxiety can be a mental and emotional barrier, which could contribute to a person not performing.\n11. Hence, the most accurate answer is Choice D, Anxiety. \nAnswer: D: Anxiety\n\nInput: This man was a good business person to others. He knew how much to charge for his product and how much to pay his employees. He was always looking for the best interest in making the money. He knew what was best. What did he do for a living? Choices:  a. businessman c. accountant B. lawyer d e. mechanic\nRationales : 1. The man is good at doing business with others, he is looking to make the most out of deals with his employees and customers.\n2. He is not a lawyer or an accountant as they are not involved in business.\n3. He is not a mechanic or a carpenter either, as they do not typically make money.\n4. He is a good and profitable businessman is the only option that fits in the context and makes sense.\n5. This choice is the best one and the correct one.\nAnswer: B: businessman\n\nInput:  A large, green boulder stands in the middle of a lake.

{"text": "fly', should also be eliminated, as it doesn't make sense within the context. \n5. Choice B may seem like a good choice regarding injury or fear, but it is out of context, pertaining more to psychological issues and not related to a performance. \n6. Choices C, D and E, while all seem likely, should also probably be rejected, as none of them clearly align with the notion of a lack of enjoyment in performing. \n7. Choice E could be the answer, if not for the fact that 'butterflies' are often associated with nervousness or excitement when approaching an event. \n8. Choices B and C both require a subjective interpretation as either of them could be 'butterflies', and that is usually not an option. \n9. Therefore, there is only one choice left, namely Choice D: 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: An important part of learning is trying to understand an subject, what must it be? Choices:  C: a challenge B: a subject E: something you have no experience with E: something new\nRationales: Since the key concept in a question is important to understand, the first step in considering what the important part is.\n3. A good option would be the challenge because to understand a subject means having to try to understand it. \n4. Challenges require effort and energy, which in turn will bring you closer to understanding it. \n5. A challenge also means putting in a lot of effort and so that makes it a likely candidate for the correct answer. \n6. \"Something new\" doesn't provide any context to the question as it's just a catch-all phrase. \n7. Finally, \"a subject\" is a vague term that doesn't explain much.\n8. That means we can reject these options. \n9. \"A challenge\" is the answer to this question.\n\nAnswer: C: a challenge\n\nInput: A doctor is a good source for learning about?

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense in the given context as it suggests that 'talent persons' have no potential to be injured or have butterflies about performing, which is contrary to the question's premise of a 'talent person'. \n5. Choice B also suggests that 'talent person' is a generic term, which it clearly is not. The same applies to Choice D, 'happiness', which implies that talent persons always experience happiness, which again, is the opposite of the assumed premise of a talent person avoiding performing. \n6. Choices B and D are further discarded in that they require an assumption that someone with a talent is also necessarily happy all of the time, which is not always the case. \n7. Choice E, however, does seem to make sense. It clearly doesn't involve physical injury or emotional reaction, and is not a generic term.\n8. Hence, while the question may be phrased in a slightly strange way, the most fitting answer is option E: energetic.\nAnswer: E) Energetic\n\nInput: What should someone not do when they're driving drunk? Choices:  a) drive in a residential zone b) drive the wrong way down a one-way street c) pass by a school bus loading and unloading passengers, with its lights flashing d) drive on the sidewalk e) drive recklessly\nRationales:  1. The question gives five options as to what someone shouldn't do when they're drunk.\n2. Only three of the five options are relevant with which to do the task.\n3. Out of the three options given, the only one that involves anything to do with passing by school buses while driving is (c) pass a school bus with its lights flashing.\n4. Thus, the options that don't mention a passing a school bus are obviously irrelevant. So, while options (a), (b), and (d) are all possible choices, option (c) stands out as the best fit.\n5. The question asked to select what someone shouldn't \"do\" when they're drunker. Here, when someone does something, they commit an action. When someone \"doesn't do something\" they refrain from committing an action. This is important information to have in mind as the choices given are about doing things,", "answer": " 99"}
{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense as it isn't a condition. \n5. Choice D, Happiness does not make sense with the question, as the question clearly describes the person in question as 'talent but doesn't like to perform'. \n6. Similarly, Choice C, anxiety, is also inappropriate as if a person is talented at performing, but does not like to do so, they are unlikely to suffer from such an emotion. \n7. Choice E, energetic, is a good choice of response, which could indicate either a condition or an emotion that would impair a person from performing.\n8. Thus, the answer is E, energetic.  \n9. \"Talent\" is a state. A person may not like performing the talent if they are nervous that they are not good enough to do it.\nAnswer: E, energetic\n\nInput: Why are people afraid of heights? Choices: \nA: They can't handle the falling\nB: Because they'll fall\nC: Fear of the unknown\nD: Fear of death\nE: Their confidence in their stability\nRationales:\n1. The question is: \"Why are people afraid of height?\". There's an implication that the fear is irrational.\n2. The options can be categorized into rational and irrational:\n3. Option A, \"They can't handle the fall\", implies that some people fear height because there is something about height that they can't handle. It's not a rational fear.\n4. Option B, \"Because they'll fall\", implies that some fear height because they think they're going to fall. It's not rational to fear something because you think you're going to do it.\n5. Option C, \"Fear of the unknown\", implies that some fear things because they don't know what will happen. It's more an irrational fear.\n6. Option D, \"because their afraid of death\", implies that some people are afraid of falling because it might be death. It's not necessarily a rational fear because we could potentially die from all sorts of different things.\n7. Option E, \"their confidence in their stability\". That's a way of saying they have a rational fear. They're", "answer": " 48"}
{"text": "fly', is incorrect due to the contradictory use of 'talent persons' and 'butterfly'. This should be a single sentence, so the second half is not an option. Even if it were grammatically correct, 'butterfly' does not have to do with performing in any way. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't quite work as the question doesn't directly suggest that they need to be happy. It only states that they don't like performing, making 'happiness' less relevant. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, appears to fit as an issue related to the performance area, as it is commonly related to performance arts and the anxiety surrounding showing your work. \n7. Therefore, we conclude that the best answer is C, anxiety.\nAnswer: C, anxiety\n\nInput: What do you believe should be the future of education? Choices:  B: classrooms C: school buildings D: computers E: teachers\nRationales: The question indicates that the asker wants the best possible answer for educational institutions today and in the future, with the aim of improving teaching and learning. \n1. We have to pick between A, B, C and E.\n2. C, B and E are place-based whereas A is more abstract. Thus, the best option for this question is E, teacher. \n3. Teachers are the primary educators; the way children teach themselves is in large part through teachers who provide a classroom setting for academic instruction. \n4. Thus, we are better off picking the answer which focuses on the individual who drives and improves the learning environment. \n5. The best choice is E, teachers.\nAnswer: E, teachers\n\nInput: At what moment of a person's life does the word \"career\" make sense? Choices: A: birth B: childhood C: teenage years D: early adulthood E: death\nRationales: A: This may seem like a word that should always make sense in a person's life but I'm sorry it doesn't. The word career is used to describe someone's job. So, at the time of a person's birth, he/she may not yet have a job. \nB: Childhood is not the most accurate answer.

{"text": "fly', is redundant as 'injury' is already excluded and 'butterfly' is defined in the sentence as a state of mental stress, not an actual insect. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is not consistent with the person's mental state as it implies they like performing. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is an emotion associated with performance and is thus relevant. \n7. Therefore, \"Anxiety\" is the correct option as it is the only option that adequately matches the given information.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: What kind of a job do some people have because they wanted to have certain experiences throughout their life? Choices:  IA: psychologists IB: doctors IC: teachers II: photographers\nRationales: The question is asking what kind of job someone might have if they wanted to have a variety of specific experiences throughout their life.\n\n1. The options being considered are a psychologist, a doctor, a teacher, a photographer, and an unknown job type.\n2. Looking at a psychologist, they would be likely to have patients with different mental health issues. This would result in exposure to a number of different people with different personalities and backgrounds. This experience would probably make them more qualified to handle different behavior types, making them feel more secure as a result.\n\n3. Looking at a doctor, they might have the opportunity to work in a number of different environments. For example, a doctor is likely to be stationed in a medical practice, a hospital or a clinic. Each of these has distinct work settings with their own distinct patients, so having the opportunity to rotate through them would lead to a number of different experiences.\n4. Looking at a teacher, as a teacher they would be in charge of a number of different students with varying personalities. It is likely they would also work with different groups of students from diverse backgrounds and with various abilities. This could lead to a range of experiences.\n\n5. Looking at a photographer, they would be able to take pictures in various settings and with various subjects. As a result, they would most certainly encounter wildly different experiences, ranging from the thrill of capturing the perfect picture to the challenge of making a portrait work in the most difficult circumstances.\n\n6. Looking at Job II, there is no information given to tell us what the job", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "fly', implies that talent persons are not permitted to experience emotions such as anxiety or happiness so it's not a good response. \n5. Choice D, \"Happiness\", is not a symptom or issue that a person would have unless they are completely psychologically impaired.\n6. Choices B, C, and D are eliminated as there are too many potential scenarios as to why someone has a talent and yet experiences worry about performing.\n7. Finally, we are left with choice E, \"Anxiety\", which explains the potential reason for the person not enjoying performing. \n8. Therefore, we can conclude that our answer is \"E: anxiety.\"\nAnswer: E: anxiety\n\nInput: How should one address a person of authority? Choices: 1. A: sir 2. B: uncle 3. C: doctor 4. D: son 5. E: mother\nRationales: The question is asking you how to address people of authority. \nTherefore, the first step to solving this is to analyze the list of authorities.\n\n1. A: Sir has become a common word that is sometimes used in combination as \"good sir\". However, it typically refers to the way men should address other men of higher status. \n2. B: Uncle addresses male relatives to male relatives in a way similar to \"Uncle Bill\" or \"Uncle Bob\". However, this address can be used to refer to a male relative who is in any position of authority, so this doesn't work.\n3. C: Doctor is a person who practices medicine to help people. It can refer to doctors who have achieved credentials or degrees in the medical field. However, calling someone \"doctor\" is typically used to refer to more senior medical doctors. \n4. D: Son is a word that indicates a male descendant by birth or adoption. \"Son\" cannot be used to refer to anyone above that person.\n5. E: Mother is the term that typically indicates a descendant by birth to all women. \"Mother\" cannot be used to address someone who is above a woman without also referring to the descendants below.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \"E: Mother\".\nAnswer: E: mother\n\nInput: If your vehicle needs to be repaired, you should seek assistance from a?

{"text": "fly',' is not factual, as some individuals may have performance-related anxiety or butterflies, which are not the same as being injured. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not have any bearing on anxieties about performing. An unhappy individual can still be anxious, such as at meeting with a judge or speaking in front of a large crowd. \n6. Therefore, it is important to discount these choices. \n7. Looking at the remaining four answers, we can determine that the best choice is E: energy. The question was saying performance anxiety could be a consequence of feeling nervous. Energy often makes people feel nervous, hence there is an issue of anxiety. \n8. Therefore, we can conclude that if someone is talented but doesn't like the performing, they likely suffer from performance anxiety or energy, as this is a likely cause of this dislike.\n9. Therefore we eliminate any of the other options except E: Energy.\nAnswer: E. Energy\n\nInput: Why does Peter Pan think he is older than Tinker Bell? Choices:  C: Because he will be older.  B: Because he isn't real.  A: He is older than Tink and other animals.  D: He is older than everyone and everything.  E: Because he is ageless.\nRationales:\n1. The question is inquiring about why Peter Pan, a character in the children's book Peter Pan, believes he is older than Tikker Bell.\n2. The question is not a riddle or a math problem so we cannot use logic to determine the best answer.\n3. Instead of using logic, we can eliminate incorrect answers based on the text.\n4. Choices B, C and D all can be answered by reading the book. However, this question is asking why Peter Pan thinks he is older than Tinke Bell. Choices B and D, 'Because he isn't real', 'Because he is older than everyone and everyone', do not provide the information to address the question.\n5. Choices A, 'Because he is old than Tink and animals', 'He is older than Tink, animals than and other everyone else and everything', have the incorrect answer structure. They need to read, \"Peter is older than Tink Bell and other animals\".\n6. Choice A,", "answer": " 558"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as the implication of the phrase is that talent persons would not be afraid to perform, butterflies are not related to performance, and suffering is not related to butterflies, and butterflies.\n5. Choices C and D are related to a form of anxiety, but that is not specified in the question. \n6. Choice B does not make any sense as it implies that butterflies are related or can be related to talent or a performance.\n7. Choices A and B, therefore, do not make sense.\n8.Choices C and D, hence, likely relate to an issue of psychological suffering related to performing - either anxiety, or an inability to experience happiness due to the strenuous conditions that performing in front of an audience could entail. \n9. Therefore, answer E is the best choice as it provides two valid answers: (1) suffering caused by stress from performing, such as anxiety, which makes sense because the sufferer is not able to enjoy performing, or (2) the inability to experience happiness while performing, which makes sense because being unable to experience happiness would equate to energetically suffering.\nAnswer: E Energetically suffering\n\nInput: How would you describe a person who is an expert on something?

{"text": "fly', doesn't apply because it's using a general phrase outside of specific reference to the topic at hand, which is a talent person with an aversion to performing.\n5. Choices C and E, 'anxiety' and 'energetic', do not directly relate to the subject of performance, so we can eliminate these.\n6. Choices D and E, 'happiness' and 'anxiety', cannot be either one of the other, so both must be considered incorrect.\n7. The phrase 'performance art' specifically refers to an art practice that is inseparable from action and/or performance. A general notion of 'performance' is a word that can be used to refer to art-making in most contexts.\n8. Choice A does not relate to the general concept of 'performance art'.\n9. Therefore, out of the given options, the best answer is either Choices A or choose D: talent.\n10. Both answers are plausible due to the ambiguity of the question.\n11. When choosing between A and D, keep in mind that the options themselves are all vague in nature.\n12. It is therefore up to the student to determine which one of the plausible options to choose between.\n13. As either could apply to our situation, it is ultimately the student's decision.\n14. However, if one assumes that this topic is more likely to be related to physical rather than mental anguish, then Choice D, 'talent' would be more appropriate as it suggests the inability to do something due to talent and thus being unable to take up the task.\nAnswer: D.

And also, talent persons can suffer from injuries too.\n6. Choices C to D: Anxiety and happiness would make sense, but not necessarily if the person's talent was related to performing arts, as performing tends to make people happy and/or anxious, and in this case they don't want to do it.\n7. So, we can rule out Choice E, as the person's performance anxiety is not due to their being \"energetic\", but rather, that performing in general makes them anxious or makes them feel happy, which doesn't allow them to choose between the two.\n8. So, by narrowing down our choices, we can rule out everything besides Choice B, 'anxiety'.\n9.

The options are: A: This is true, B: Not at all I am qualified, C: Incorrect,I am not qualified.\n4. Looking at the options again, we know it is impossible for a person to be not qualified and yet to be qualified at the same time, which makes option C incorrect.\n5. Furthermore, the options imply an uncertainty about whether the person is qualified for their homework or not. This excludes option B because the question asks you if you are qualified to do your home, not if other people are qualified.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is D.\n7.

Choice D, \"happiness\", should be eliminated because there is a possibility of happiness and/or talent while not performing, and while performing, respectively. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\" should also be eliminated because anxiety does not seem related the performing. The question doesn't ask about not performing but rather about liking performing. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", is wrong because while energetic people can be talented, they may not like performing. 8. This leaves only Choice D, 'anxiety', as a valid possibility.\n9.

D: southern lilt E: slow speech\nRationales:\n1. The question is about accents associated with people from New England, as the region is one of the more prominent regions of the United States of America.\n2. Choice 1,'regional accent', is an appropriate answer because New England is a region of the country.\n3. Choices 2 and 3 are too specific because they are specific to a single type of region or subregion. \n4. Chokes 4,'southern lilt', isn't related to New England because it is a different region of the country. The lilt is likely not associated with people from this region.\n5. Choise 5,'slow speech,' isn't associated with New England, so it can be eliminated.\n6.

Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', are emotions that can either help someone overcome performance anxiety or make it more likely to affect them. Neither of those answers helps us understand why this person has a problem performing.\n6. Finally, Choice E, 'energetic', describes a person who has a lot of energy. It does not help us understand more about the people's mental health. \n7. Therefore, none of the choices are directly helpful.\n8. Further, we can't say that it is something completely unrelated such as injury or butterflies, but it must fit in this context.\n9. Anxiety could be a valid answer here because it is a mental issue that could be an obstacle to performing.

Choices: A: a triangle B: two triangles C: two triangles D: a three sided shape E: two sided shape\nRationales: There are 5 choices: A: a triangle, B: two triangles, C: two triangles, D: a three-sided shape, E: two-sided shape. \t\nIf it has 3 sides, it cannot be a 2 sided shape, and vice-versa. \t\nIt is probably better to go through all 5 choices, but if you're going for efficiency it could be narrowed down to 3: A, B & E. \n-a triangle has 3 sides & is 3-sided therefore it cannot be this. \t\n-two triangles has 2 sides & is 2-sided, therefore it cannot be this either. \t\n-three-sided-shapes will usually not have equal sides, meaning they will not always be triangles, and so would not count. \n-two-sided-shaped are usually just rectangles, and would not count.", "answer": " 216"}
{"text": "fly', is a strange turn of phrase. However, if this were a rephrased version of the question, it could be interpreted as if the choice is saying: \"talented people do not like performing in front of people.\" \n5. This option still does not fit as it implies that the reason the talent person doesn't like performing is a fear and butterflies. However, that could describe any number of people in any domain of performance, and thus, is not necessarily related to a talent person.\n6. Therefore, this is one we can remove from consideration. \n7. Choice C, it is possible that an anxious person may not like performing, this is true, but it is not the reason that a talent person may not like performing. Also, choice C isn't a great word choice. To be happy is a mental state, it doesn't follow that happiness will fix something else. \n8. Choice D, the adjective 'energetic' is not related to performing, as they are not mutually exclusive traits. Some extremely talented people are not energetic and some people with no talent at all can be lively and active. \n9. Choice E is one of the only choices left. \n10. We can consider the remaining options. First is choice B, this choice is trying to say \"a talent persons cannot suffer from performance anxiety and butterflies\". We can reasonably assume that this is true. It is possible that a talent person suffers from anxiety in general, this is true. However, it is not true that a talent person who suffers from anxiety will magically want to perform because they're now happy. This makes the choice B incorrect, it fits, but it doesn't make sense.\n11. The final option is choice D it is the only one that fits. Therefore, the answer to the riddle is E: energetic.\nAnswer: E. : energetic", "answer": " 14000"}
{"text": "fly', is an example of a correct, but irrelevant choice. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is a good indicator of what someone might enjoy doing, but it's an emotion. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is an indication that the person is apprehensive.\n7. Therefore the person is anxious about performing their talent, because as people who want to perform and are talented but don't enjoy performing.\n8. Therefore the correct answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C, anxiety\n\nInput: How do you feel after eating a lot of candy? Choices: \t A: happy\t B: healthy\t C: sick\t D: sad\t E: excited\nRationales: The question asks what happens after eating a lot candy.\n1. A number of the answers don't make any sense. A person can't be \"happy\" after eating a lot.\n2. Other options aren't particularly relevant to what's asked either. \n3. There are two choices that have to do with physicality, however: options D and E and we can ignore them for the time being. \n4. Options C and D indicate that the results are negative, but we're looking for what happens after eating candy \u2013 so we should consider elimination or elimination. Looking at both of these options, we can find out that eating candy has side effects.\n5. So, the correct answer is most likely A: have negative side effects. \nAnswer: A. Having Negative Side Effects\n\nInput: If a shark is sick of it\u2019s little tank, then what do you do? Choices: 0 A: Feed the shark fish\t B: Let the shark out of the tank\t C: Keep the shark around\t D: Feed shark more fish\t E: Get the shark a bigger tank\nRationales: Looking at the question as a whole, it includes wording like \"sick of it's little tank\", \"looking for some open water\" and \"a new environment\" which suggests that the shark could benefit from a bigger habitat.\n1. Choice B isn't appropriate because letting a shark out isn't a good idea. \n2. Choice D states \"Feeding the shark more fish", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": "fly', is also too specific and not what is being asked. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", while energetic can be related to happiness, doesn't describe an emotional state that is specific to unhappy talent persons. Additionally, it can potentially refer to any person who is energetic. \n6. Choice D, \"anxiety\", is a common feeling among some people and can be related to an unwillingness to perform. Choice D is a good answer, it's just that there could be more than one possibility. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\" doesn't fit, because it doesn't necessarily explain why this person has an aversion to performing. \n8. Therefore, by removing all the less relevant possibilities, \"anxiety/shyness\" can be reasonably interpreted as the answer to the question.\nAnswer: I: anxiety/shyness", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": "fly', makes no sense as butterfly effects aren't a psychological ailment. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't make sense as happiness isn't associated with any talent in particular. \n6. Choice C, can relate to anxiety. However, considering the question, anxiety would not be a general ailment associated with all talents, making it less plausible. So for now, we'll remove that choice. \n7. Choice E, energetic, as a talent is most often thought of as an energy, not an inhibition.\n8. Therefore to answer this question, a logical choice is B: C: Anxiety\nAnswer: B: Anxiety\n\nInput: When you are a little kid what is usually on your Christmas wish list? Choices: 1: A: family members B: candy C: money D: toys E: shoes\nRationales:1. The question is stating what typically appears on the wish list of a \"little kid\" for Christmas. 2.

{"text": "fish', isn't correct as butterflies are a type of insect and injury isn't a relevant concern for insects. \n5. Choice D, happiness, isn't relevant and so should be excluded. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, likely refers to an emotional reservation as this is a word commonly associated with feelings of anxiety. An anxiety disorder is a mental disorder that affects a person's emotions and overall sense of well-being. It's characterized by feeling anxious or worried. So, this is the most likely of the remaining choices.\n7. Therefore we can select Choice C, anxieties. \nAnswer: C: anxieties\n\nInput: When did the scientists say they wanted the study to start?

It's more likely they would provide a more concrete date such as September 20th or October 18th.\nB: The scientists would not provide a date before August 20th or September 27th, as the study didn't start until this day. This suggests Choice A is incorrect and is excluded.\nC: The date provided suggests this must be the start date of the study, as it was 4 years and 4 months into the future from this point. In general, scientists tend to plan their studies years in advance.\nD: The date provided suggests the study will last the same duration as in Choice C. So, we can exclude Choice D as the study isn't set to end at this point.\nE: The date provided suggests that Choice E must be a past date, as the study had already been in progress. Therefore, Exclude Choice E.\nSo, the most likely choice is Choice C as there's nothing in the information presented to indicate otherwise and the study will likely continue.\n\nAnswer: If the information given was too vague, we'd eliminate a", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "fly', also doesn't make sense as talent is not a person but a skill or talent (a person's ability or proficiency). \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't fit as the individual would have to feel some kind of happiness in order to feel a reservation about performing.\n6. Choices E, 'energetic', doesn't make sense because if someone is \"energetic\" they are generally passionate and energetic about performing, not feeling a reservation about performing due to a talent.\n7. \"Anxiety\" is when someone feels nervous or worried, and can relate to emotions and feeling more than just performance. \n8. Looking at choices C and D, it can be eliminated by considering that \"talent\" is an ability or proficiency - an inherent skill. \n9. However, it is not like a \"personality\" or the \"lacking of a skill\" which could be implied by the statement \"if someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing\". \n10. So, it can be eliminating as the statement doesn't actually describe a lacking talent. \n11. This leaves us with choice D, which makes the most sense. \n12.

{"text": "fly', may sound like a direct response to the question, but it doesn't really answer it. It doesn't address the person's struggle to perform. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", is also not the answer because the energy that is mentioned has nothing to do with performing and is not connected with any psychological aspects of it. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety,\" is the best answer because it is the only other choice that has anything to do with the performance and could be an issue that could prevent the person from performing. \n7.

{"text": "fly', is unhelpful as it provides a list, not a specific answer. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't relate specifically to the person suffering because it suggests a specific type of energy and doesn't account for their aversion to performing. \n6.

None of them account for what the astronaut might be thinking. That is our best shot.  Choice 1: Why do astronauts use signs such as HI in space. This would only be interesting if she saw other signs.  Choice 2: Why the signs are related to the planets. This could be an interesting thing for her to think about because she can deduce that the poster is based on something. Also, this makes the question less vague because there are no more options.

{"text": "fly', could be considered, but butterflies generally mean feelings of nervousness, and talented people aren't necessarily neurotic, so this is not likely of concern. \n5. Choice D, happiness, could seem viable, since they 'don't like performing,' however, it's likely too broad a term, as people may not always like performing. \n6.

Choices:  C: squirrel B: dog A: rat E: rabbit D: elephant\nRationales:1. The question is focused on what type of animal the man is most likely to be since he is waiting for his girlfriend. \n2. The question can be clarified to make more sense by asking 'what mammal' instead of 'what animal', given the context provided by the question.\n3. When you consider mammals, and think about the type of animal most likely to be waiting for someone it's likely to be a dog since it is the kind of animal people would associate with loyalty and warmth.\n4. The other choices don't match the context of the question given by the sentence structure of 'what animal' is he most likely to being, because they are not mammals and they are unlikely to be waiting for his girlfriend in particular.\n5. Choices A, B, and D, are not mammals, so they shouldn't be considered.\n6. Choices, C and E are too specific for this question.\n7.

{"text": "fly' is grammatically incorrect and nonsensical. \n5. Choice D, happiness is unlikely, as this would presuppose the person has a talent that could generate happiness; in this case, it is unclear what the talent is, or how it could be a source of happiness. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is a mental state that describes being nervous, apprehensive, or overwhelmed with worry (Merriam-Webster). \n7. Choice E, energy, has no meaning regarding the issue discussed - which is that the person doesn't like performing. \n8. Choice C, \"anxiety,\" matches the question as it describes a mental state of nervousness, which could stem from any number of potential reasons. \n9.

Choices:   A: During their annual meeting     B: During early March     C: In July   D: In the summer     E: During Thanksgiving\nRationales:  1. The question is posing a scenario which includes a specific event, or date. This information gives us hints to eliminate some of our options.\n2. Choice E, \"During Thanksgiving\" is not applicable, as it does not provide any reason as to why it's a good idea to visit the zoo during that event.\n3. Choices A, B, C appear to be annual events, which would not make it a good time to visit.\n4. Choices D, \"In the summer\" seem to be based on the weather at that time.\n5. Therefore, since there is no logic to \"In the summer\" being a good time to visit it is not a good answer choice. \n6. However, \"During their annual meeting\" is a good answer choice because it provides a specific date as to why it would be a good time to visit the zoo.\n7.

{"text": "flys', sounds odd and does not seem to be connected to the theme of the question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, seems to be connected to performance and is the opposite of the desired emotional outcome, therefore is incorrect. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, is a potential root cause of this issue as an anxiety disorder can prevent someone from performing in front of an audience.\n7. Choices A, 'talent' and B, 'talented', do not explain what happens if the person doesn't likes performing or what will happen to them if they do nothing to address their anxiety. \n8. Therefore, we can determine that 'anxiety' seems to be a likely option.\n9. We can, however, rule out choice A, 'talent people cannot suffer from anxiety and butterflies' because it doesn't make sense that talent itself can cause anxiety.\n10.

Choices:  C: dark night A: dusk B: twilight E: midnight D: noon\nRationales:  1. Look at the list of choices \u2013 they include dawn, dusk, midnight, noon, and dark night. None of those choices answer this question.\n2. This question is looking for the previous answer in regards to time, meaning the answer doesn\u2019t have to refer to the time of day.\n3. Look over the phrasing \u2013 It says time before the time prior. There are two words we can use to describe times other than the present: earlier and later. The word earlier doesn\u2019t make sense, because now is prior to the previous morning. The word later doesn\u2019t make sense either because prior means before.\n4. The correct answer is A, dusk.\n5. What does dusk mean? When you look at a dictionary, it says that it is the time between sunset and dark night- the light before dark. So if dusk is the time before dark, dawn is the time before dusk. We already determined that there is no such question (dawn before dawn), so dusk is the answer.\nAnswer: A, dusk\n\nInput: When is a day called a night? Cho", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "fly', is not correct because butterflies are not inherently a person, injury is a physical condition, and'suffer' is not relevant.\n5. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness' respectively, both don't make sense in this context since they are psychological conditions that may affect performance but don't indicate whether someone truly enjoys or dislikes performing. \n6. Choice D, the word 'energetic' does not make sense here as it does not fit the description of someone who is both naturally talented and likes performing. 7. The best answer, then, is choice E: 'anxiety', as it is the psychological condition that best fits the description of someone who might not enjoy performing. 8.

The saying is supposed to indicate that the occurrence of an event in one place could also happen in another place. Therefore, the answer could be different from the occurrence the first time, the second time, or if it doesn't happen again. 3. The word 'time' means moment, or period, of time, in this context. 4.

Choice D, a person \"who cannot suffer from injury and cannot suffer from butterfly\", is a possibility but does not relate to performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, seems correct to the question due to 'butterflies' in the text. While anxiety is also psychological, it can relate to performing, through fear of failure. \n7. Choice E, excitement or energy, is also possible since it sounds similar to anxiety. However, a person's energy level is not a factor in whether or not they perform.\n8.

Choices C and D talk about anxiety and happiness, respectively. However, these emotions rarely prevent someone from performing.\n6. Choices E and C talk about injury or butterflies, but these are not relevant to a psychological reservation related to performing. \n7. Answer A is an unlikely answer because the person would not be able to perform. If the person did not enjoy performing, not performing would not prevent them from performing.\n8. Hence, the best answer is E, 'energetic'. This word does make sense in terms of describing an ability to perform.\nAnswer: E. energetic", "answer": " 4"}

Choices B and D both speak of 'anxiety' and 'happiness', however, an anxious person is generally unhappy, so we can already exclude this choice. \n8. Lastly, choice E, 'energetic', refers to a person having energy, not an aversion to performing. \n9. Hence, we are left with a choice between options B and D.\n10.

{"text": "fly,' is incorrect because it claims that persons who don't suffer from either injury or anxiety are actually talented. The second half of the sentence doesn't make sense within the context. \n5.

Choice C, \"anxiety', is a common feeling many performers experience before a show. \n7. Choice B, \"butterflies', isn't specific to a performance setting, which is what the person is presumably suffering from. \n8. This narrows the choices to being 'anxiety' and 'anxiety.'\n9.

{"text": "fly,' is a sentence fragment that doesn't make sense. Furthermore, the phrase is redundant, as butterflies are commonly experienced by people (especially performers) who have anxiety. \n5. Choice D is likely not the answer. 'Happiness' is too general of a term and doesn't specifically reference any psychological obstacles a person with talent might have to overcome. Furthermore, it is highly unlikely that any successful performer is unaffected by nerves or anxiety. \n6. Choice C is likely not the answer either. 'Anxiety' is a form of psychological stress that people with talent can suffer from, as it is a common challenge that performers face and can cause some hesitation. \n7. Hence, of the remaining three choice options, two of them focus only on psychological obstacles: C and D. \n8. It doesn't make sense that a happy person would experience an anxiety, because anxieties are often caused by a perceived risk of failure. For example, worry over a mistake or poor performance. Thus, it is unlikely that a happy person would have this anxiety. \n9. We are left with E: energetic. An energized person can face stress or anxiety and not be inhibited from performing. Additionally, being energetic is something that a person who doesn't always enjoy performing can still feel motivated to do. \n10. Hence, the answer is E.\nAnswer: E.

Either way, the person will ask a more experienced or higher level person to assist them due to having a different skill level or level of knowledge of the subject matter. The question doesn't reference asking their boss for help or asking someone outside the office for assistance, only those already on your team or more experienced or higher up.

Choice D, \u2018happiness\u201d does not make sense either as someone who is unhappy in their career is probably not happy in general.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energetic', both describe emotional states that might be correlated to an inclination to not perform. This leaves Choice B, 'anxiety'.\n7. Hence, the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: A, anxiety\n\nInput: A person walks into a room. The first chair they sit in is what? Choices: A. chair B. stool C. chair and stool D. the chair and stool E. only if all chairs and stoop were full\nRationales: After one of the chairs is used, the person walks into the room. The person, if possible, wants to pick up as little space as possible in the room. \n1. After one of the chains is used, the person is the first to walk in, there is one more seat left. 2. The person should immediately sit in that seat. 3. If someone else is still on that seat. 4. The first person sits next to the seat. 5. To have as much space as possible in the chair, the person should sit next to the stool. 6. The person can think of the seat. 7. Choice A: As long as the only empty seat left is the chair. 8. The choice has nothing to do with the answer. 9. Choice B: The only empty seat left at that time is the chair. 10. When there are more than one empty chairs in the room, the chair does not exist. 11. Choice C: At that time, both chairs and stools are not related to the question of the situation. 12. Choice D: The answer depends on whether or not someone else is on another seat. 13.

{"text": "fly ', isn't accurate as this doesn't take into account how many factors can affect how successful one feels during a performance. \n5. Choice D, happiness, can be related to having a successful performance, but does not affect the person's incentive to perform.\n6. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energetic', can cause the person to have different feelings about performing. But, the questions asks the cause of an unwillingness to perform. The choices do not directly answer this. \n7. Therefore, both choices can be narrowed down.\n8. Choice C, \"anxiety,\" and can be ruled out because while anxiety can be a reason, it is not the sole cause of feeling reluctant to perform. \n9. Further, choice C is too general because the type of anxiety mentioned is not directly related to performing. \n10. Choice E, \"energetic\", is related to a person being more willing to perform, not less inclined. Thus, not directly answering the question.\n11. Therefore, the option we should be left with is Answer Choice \"B\" - the person is suffering from anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety", "answer": " 216"}
{"text": "fly', is an unusual option presented as if it were a possibility.\n5. Choices C and E refer to 'anxiety' and 'energy' as if they were dislikes or aversions, but their choices do not support it. Furthermore, Choice E refers specifically to being 'energetic', not being anxious. So, they do not connect well.\n6. Choices B and C refer to 'anxieties' and 'joy', respectively, but this still does not relate to an unwelcome feeling about performing.\n7. Hence, the best choice is Choice D, as this matches up to the question and is therefore the most plausible.\nAnswer: D. Anxiety\n\nInput: Who is the president of the United States? Choices:  VP: Vice President EVP: Executive Vice President EV: Executive Vice President\nRationales: Let's look at the options and determine which answer is most likely.\n1. To better understand each of the options, let's look at what defines a position of power. A vice president would typically be in the running for president. However, they would not be one. So, it does not make sense for this candidate to be the vice president.\n2. Since the vice president is out of the list of options, we can eliminate the candidates that do not refer to the vice president, which includes EVP. \n3. There is also no option to indicate a vice president without specifying another office, so the remaining choice is EV. \n4. But what exactly is an executive vice president? It is a specific title in some companies that acts as both a vice president and a managing director. It's not a role that typically exists outside of that kind of company structure.\n5. Therefore, we can eliminate it as an outsider to the corporate structure.\n6. Looking at the remaining choice, we can rule out EVP, as it does not refer directly to the president. \n7. The remaining option, then, is EV - Executive Vice President.\nAnswer: VP: Vice President\n\nInput: Why do sharks have a body made up of bones and a backbone?

{"text": "flys', might be meant in jest to illustrate how ludicrous all of these choices are. However, it still does not fit because an injury is not a feeling or reservation - this is something that affects a person's physiological well-being, rather than their thoughts or emotions.\n5. Choices C and E do not relate to the question and are thus eliminated.\n6. Looking at what we know about performance-based arts and talented people, it is often natural to feel nervous, anxious, worried, or stressed prior to performing because the act is exposed to so many variables that might make or break it, such as the stage layout, lighting, timing, sound, audience reactions, etc. \n7. Thus, Choice D, 'anxiety', makes the most sense as it is in line with the facts we know to be true about performance-based arts.\n8. Therefore the choice is D: anxiety.\nAnswer: D. anxiety", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "' can't be correct as that sentence should read 'talented people can suffer from injuries,' which does not mean anything in the context. \n5. Choice E, \"energetic\", as stated in the question, isn't the most reliable choice, as it describes a person who is full of energy, not a person who would shy away from performing.\n6. Looking at the other options, we can further narrow down our choices. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\", makes the most sense. It matches the textual context and the general psychological connection between anxiety and shy away from fears. \n8. And therefore the best answer is Choice C, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: In the year 1977, the average age of the United States was 22 years old. What was the age of the youngest person in 1977? Choices:   A: 19 years B: 23 years C: 22 years D: 20 years E: 18 years\nRationales:  1. The question is seeking the age of the young person in 1900 as of 1977.\n2. It'd be reasonable to think this question is about the youngest person.\n3. While the options mention a range of numbers representing ages, the numbers in the options vary in a fairly dramatic way. However, the answer does not correspond with these extreme numbers.\n4. To select the correct answer, it is best to consider which numbers are too high, and how many of the options are plausible and not. \n5. Looking at choice A, '19 years', it is not plausible given that the text states the year was 1977 when the typical age was 22 years. This is an age much too low for the expected average. \n6. Also, among the choices, Choice E, '18 years', is the only choice that directly relates to the year 1900. It is the only reasonable choice, and the best answer.\nAnswer: D E: 18\n\nInput: The penguin has adapted to the cold environment, by what method?

{"text": "fly', makes no sense. Butterflies do not relate to either injuries or talents. More importantly, the question is asking about talent, not persons with talent. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\" is also not directly related to the question. \n6. Choice C, \"talent persons can't suffer from injury and anxiety\" makes sense but this is not the key idea of the question as it can be generalized to the broader category of \"psychological reservation about performing\". \n7. Similarly, choice E \"energetic\" doesn't make sense, as people don't usually consider themselves to be \"energetic\" when they are \"suffering\" from something.\n8. So, essentially, what remains are choices B and C.\n9. Since choice B mentions \"butterflies\", it is the answer that best fits the context.\nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot perform\n\nInput: During the 2020 election, a large portion of the vote was casted using an app called what? Choices: A: Google apps E: Google play B: YouTube C: YouTube music D: YouTube TV\nRationales: Choice E, \"Google play\" is not a suitable answer since it is not an app. The question specifically states that a \"large portion of the vote\" was casted using an \"app\", and not an \"application\". \nChoice A, \"Google apps\", is also incorrect as \"Google apps\" is a generic term for applications that the company has developed. The question does not mention any specific app used by a majority of voters. \nThe same principle applies to Choice B, \"YouTube\", and Choice C, \"YouTube music\". Both of these are platforms, not apps, and thus do not make sense when the context specifically demands an app.\nChoice D, \"YouTube TV\", is also irrelevant since it specifically requires an app, not a television service.\nThe only viable choice left is Choice D, \"YouTube\", as YouTube is an app.\nAnswer: D. \"YouTube\"\n\nInput: What are we learning or teaching as a verb?

{"text": "fly's', is not an actual logical statement, and does not make any sense. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is unlikely as it is not a negative or distracting emotion. \n6. Choice C, Anxiety, and option E, 'energetic' are similar to feeling anxious as they are both emotional experiences. \n7. Therefore, these options can be eliminated from consideration. \n8. Choice B, talent person cannot suffer from injury andbutterfly's, was eliminated. \n9. Looking at the other four choices, we can eliminate Choice B, 'anxiety' and Choice D, 'injury' as they are emotional states, rather than things that a person suffers from. \n10. Likewise, Choice E, 'energetics' does not make sense, given that it is an unrelated word. Additionally, as it ends with a plural's', this would be a state that a person suffers numerous instances of, which would not make sense in this context, and would also be very rare. \n11. Thus eliminating 3 out of these 4 choices. \n12. Only Choice C, 'anxiety', remains. \n13. Therefore, the best choice for the question is Choice C, 'Anxiety'.\nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: The boy and girl were playing hide and seek, and the girl was hiding by the?

First, let's see what does not make sense: \n\n- Choice A, \u2018toothbrush.\u2019 Clearly not. \n\n- Choices B, C, and D, \u2018laser,\u2019 \u2018drill\u2019 and \u2018hand mirror\u2019 could potentially be associated with dentistry, but they would be the wrong context here. \n\n-Choice E, \u2018pliers.\u2019 Pliers are often used as tools to grab things, but their use is not the focus here.\n\n2. Now let\u2019s look at what is plausible: \n\n-Choice B, \u2018laser.\u2019 A laser is indeed a common medical device, and using a laser could indeed clear out teeth. \n\n-Choices C and D, \u2018drill\u2019 and \u2019hand mirror,\u2019 are also options, but they aren't the most precise ones.\n\n-Choice A, \u2018tooth brush,\u2019 is also a possible answer, but it\u2019s not very precise. \n\n-So the best answer is to choose choice B, \u2018laser\u2019, since it\u2019s the most definitive choice.\n\nAnswer: B.

{"text": "fly' is not an actual sentence, creating a confusing answer. \n5. Choice E, \"enjoy energetic,\" doesn't reflect a negative response to performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is a potential response, but the answer is more likely to reflect a complete lack of interest rather than merely uncomfortable feelings that could be controlled with some effort. \n7. Choice E, however, does reflect this complete lack of interest. \n8.

A: noise intolerance 2. B: anxiety 3. C: age 4. D: medical history 5. E: deafness\nRationales: This is an argumentation task.\n1. The question asks about the factors that can affect the quality, or state, of a person's ability to hear.\n2. This is a very broad term which means there are many factors that can influence a person's hearing. However, among the given choices, there are several that do not.\n3. Considering option D, ''medical history''. a person's medical history cannot affect one's quality of hearing as hearing health is not always affected by, for example, heart disease.\n4. Similarly, consider the word 'deafness' from choice E. A definition of deafness explains deafness is ''a partial or total inability to hear'' or ''a total inability to hear''. In other words, deafness is not a state in which a person does have hearing and could be affected. Deafness is a term to describe someone has no hearing, therefore, this answer choice cannot affect what the question is asking about.\n5. Anxiety, while a common mental health condition, does not directly refer to hearing. It could affect one's ability to hear by reducing the amount of noise they are willing to allow, but this isn't a factor that would affect the quality of a hearing. \n6. Older students can be at increased risk of hearing loss and are also more likely to have related factors such as high noise levels through jobs or recreation, but the question is focusing", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": "flys'. While it's technically correct, it's not relevant to the question, and is therefore disregarded. \n5. Choices C, D and E are still relevant because they all deal with psychological aspects of performance arts. \n6. However, we've already ruled out 'talent' as a related term. \n7. This means that if we look at the choices by eliminating those that relate directly to Talent, the ones left are 'anxiety' and 'happiness'. \n8. Looking at the meaning of each choice, we can see that 'happiness' is only relevant in the context of 'joy' because it is derived from 'joy' and as the question concerns mental inaccessibility to performing, we can eliminate it, leaving us with 'anxiety'. \n9. Therefore, anxiety is the answer.\nAnswer: A - anxiety\n\nInput: Which of the following actions or items would stop one's watch? Choices: 1. Washing hands while holding watch 2.

Keeping watch in pocket without a watchstrap\nRationales: The given choice can be simplified into two choices.\n1. Keeping watch in the pocket [carrying without a watchstrap].\n2. Washing hands [holding hand on stomache].\nSo the key here is to find a choice which is mentioned before washing hands.\n3. From the remaining choices, it is clear that only choices 1 and 2 are mentioned before washing hands [keeping watch in pocket].\n4.

{"text": "fly's', also doesn't make sense. There is no such word as 'talent person'. \n5. Choice D, happiness doesn't make sense given the question, as it specifically refers to anxiety and does not include other feelings. \n6. Choices C and E aren't completely ruled out, since they could be potential feelings experienced by an anxious person, but they aren't the central focus of the question which asks about a talent person that doesn't like performing.\n7. Therefore what's left is a choice between choice A and choice E. \n9. Considering the question, Choice E, 'energetic', might be what the person is feeling, but it's too general to be specific enough to describe a person that dislikes performing. It doesn't differentiate from someone who enjoys performing.\n10. Choice A, Anxiety, makes sense given the context provided in the question.

Choice D, happiness, is not a suitable answer to the question because it doesn't address the question about performance anxiety (applied to an artist), but is rather a personal preference. \n6.

Usually, people do not expect to find houses on bridges (although there are exceptions). \n3. Option D, \"a house\", makes sense because houses are typically situated between spaces - that of the ground and that of the sky.\n4. Option D, \"bridge\", makes sense because bridges are usually located in a space between two other spaces. \n5. With Option A removed, the available options include \"a bridge\" and \"a house\".

A person who is afraid to perform will likely feel nervous and anxious before they go on stage. \n7.

Choices: 1. A: hen B: duck C: chicken D: goose E: turkey\nRationales: When a group of birds is referred to as a 'flock', the members of that group are usually all of the same species. For example, a flock of chickens or a flock of ducks.\n\nThus, if we were to call a group of hens and rooster a 'flock' we would be saying they are all chickens.\n\nWe can then work on cross-out any answers that are no longer viable or relevant ones.\n\nConsidering choice A, hen: a single hen is not a common group of hens that refers to all hens, as it would be a mixture of all the hen species in the group.\nTherefore, option A, hen, is incorrect as it is not a common group designation for a single hen.\n\nSimilarly, considering Option B, duck: a duck is a specific bird species, not a common group or term used to describe a group of birds, even if the birds are the same species.\nTherefore, choice B, duck, is also incorrect as it is not the common grouping for a group of hens which are of similar species.\n\nConsider option C, chicken: A common group or term for hens or chickens refers to both male or female.

Choices:  B: find evidence that man had already died by the time his wife did C: find evidence that defendent was not murderer D: find an alternative person who could have committed the crime E: find the reason why the investigation did not go well\nRationales:1. The question asks \"what was the defense attorney \" trying to?\" \n2. Looking back at the sentence it appears \"what was the defense \" is an introductory phrase or an instruction because it begins with \"what was\" and it does not complete a thought.\n3. The only thing in the sentence that is complete and can stand alone is the word \"defense\".\n4. Considering this, one cannot conclude that the question is asking \"who was trying to find an alternative person\" or \"what was trying to find an evidence that the man had already died by [the time his wife did ]\" as these \"who\" and \"what\" don't start with \"what was\".\n5. Hence, the best fit to this question can be \"the defense was trying to\" find these things because of this sentence structure. 6.

This is suggested by Choice C, \"Anxiety\", which makes reference to both the inability to feel anxiety and the inability to perform. \n8. Therefore, by considering the possible answer choices, the best candidate is Choice C, 'Anxiety'. \n9. This makes sense as anxiety could arise due to fear or a lack of confidence in one's ability. \n10. This could lead to a person feeling unable to perform or unable to overcome their anxiety.\n11.

Choices: 1: A: Wave 2: B: Whirlpool 3: C: Tsunami 4: D: Tidal Wave 3: E: Waterfall\nRationales: Given that the question states it is about an ocean current, we know that the current can consist of either water or both water and items in the water. Choice B, a 'Whirlpool', can be found within both water and a current. Both Choice 3 'Tsunami' and Choice 4 'Tidal Wave' can be found within the water current. Choice 5, 'Waterfall', is a type of current but only exists within water rather than a water current. Choice A, \"Wave\", is more appropriately associated with tides rather than a current.\n2. Choice B, \"Whirlpool\", is the most common answer.\nAnswer: 2: B: Waves\n\nInput: The question states that the most common thing to happen to an ocean current is a 'Wave'.

However, we know that this particular person suffers from the latter emotion, so Choice D, 'happiness', shouldn't be on the list. \n7.

Squirrels are not specific enough to describe an overrun house.\nChoice B. rabbits are not specific enough to describes an overrun house. \nChoice C. Mold can start in a house, however. it's not something that typically spreads across an entire house.\nChoice D. Termites. While termites could be found in a house, it is less likely that they would overrun the entire house. This is where mice, which can spread very quickly, would most likely be the answer.\nChoice E.

No result was apparent E. Her hands were covered with ink\n\nRationales:1. Experimental research and observations typically yield results as they are often designed to determine the impact of a factor. They don't usually lead to non-results. So, the choice with no result would be incorrect.2. Choices A and C are about ravens and the writing desk. So, they aren't related to the question at all.3. Choice B might be relevant as it's about a book, but it's unlikely that a book about ravens would be the result of the experiment.4. Choice D talks about 'involuntary ink covering' as a result of the experiment. But it's not related to the experiment.5.

Choice D, happiness is not a symptom, but a result of an appropriate talent selection. (Ex: happiness is experienced when you are able to apply your talents well)\n6.

Choices: 1: 4 PM 2: 7 PM 3: 6 AM 4: 12 PM 5: 1 AM\nRationales: Let's break this question down to find out what might be going on.\n1. This question seems to be asking what time the news is typically broadcast during a typical day, and it refers back to the prior question of when someone would turn on the TV news in response to feeling bored.\n2. Now let's look to the choices:\na. 1: 4pm: Not 4pm, but rather 12pm. This is likely a typo. It is possible that a typo in a written question may not be corrected, so it may still be best to eliminate this answer.\nb. 2: 7pm: The 7pm news airs on most nights. This is not a good answer because most likely, if a person felt bored at 1pm, they're not waiting until 7 to watch the news.\nc. 3: 6am: Not 6am, but instead 4am. This is likely a time-of-day typo similar to the first answer.\nd. 4: 1pm: Possibly a typo. It would still be best to eliminate it.\ne: 5: 1am: The news airs at 1am.

{"text": "fly', isn't a complete answer and does not apply as it is not mentioned in the question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, and Choice E, being energic, do not provide a direct answer as they do not provide a reason for someone being concerned about performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, however, is a psychological state, and one that can be related to public performance, thereby making the best answer C: anxiety.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is C: anxiety. \nInput: The most powerful weapon is? Choices:  I: courage II: knowledge III: strength IV: patience V: loyalty\nRationales: Note that the answer choices are incorrect. The correct answer would be D. \nRationales: Option 5, loyalty, is not a weapon, as it is a character trait.\nRationales: The most powerful weapon, per se, is knowledge. Knowledge, as it is the ability to gain access to information that would provide competitive advantage in a battlefield, can potentially lead to victory.\nRationales 7: Strength is a state that does not require much thought or planning. It is likely that it can simply be overpowered.\nRationales8: Patience may be an effective weapon in a battle scenario, but it is not the most powerful weapon. Patience can be effective in maintaining one's composure in the face of aggression and adversity. \nRational: 9: Courage may be a powerful characteristic, but it is not a weapon. Having courage can also mean acting without thinking it through, which may be ineffective. In the battlefield, one needs to be intelligent and strategic in their actions in order to be successful.\nRationales10: Loyalty is another trait. There are two sides to a war, and loyalty does not determine the outcome of battles. While loyalty can be effective in fostering teamwork and unity, it is not the most effective weapon or factor for victory in a combat scenario.\nRationale: 11: While information can be a useful tool, it would likely only be successful if one has some understanding of the enemy and their tactics.

Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', cannot all apply at the same time. If the person is suffering from anxiety, they probably will not be happy with themselves in the way they are performing. Therefore, these choices cannot be the likely answer. \n6.

Ran\nThe answer is not: E - The ghost story made them scared so they screamed and tried to get away.\nRationales: The question asks what the children did after they became afraid. \nThe best way to understand the logical flow of this question is to identify the information given, determine what action or actions that information is suggesting, and then eliminate choices that could possibly happen. \nWe already know that becoming afraid is a response to the ghost story. Since the children were afraid of the ghost story, they probably tried to get away from wherever they were. Considering the following choices, we can eliminate a couple as incorrect.\n1. Staying: This is incorrect because the question specifically states that they ran away from the ghost story.\n2. Running: Since these are children and we know they are trying to get away from the ghost, they are running away, not running toward, the ghost story. \nIf they are trying to move away from the ghost it would be reasonable to assume they were not staying or standing at the time when the ghost story occurred.\n3. Staying: The children are running away from the ghost according to the question, but if they are going to stay then they wouldn't be running. If they are running, then they are not staying.\n4.

Choice D, \"anxiety\" fits perfectly with the question and describes a psychological limitation to performing.

When evaluating the options, the more relevant option should be chosen. \n8. For this, we should compare Choice C: anxiety vs Choice D: energetic. Given the context of the question it makes more sense for Choice C: anxieties about performing can be understood as a factor that would cause one to feel nervous or anxious about performing, which is related to the intended question. \n9.

The key phrase is 'is so' - in this particular scenario, we are searching for something that specifically describes how the ocean is salty.\n6. In this question, there are three different parts of the question that need to be taken into consideration.\n7. First, the salt in the ocean is what helps form the earth's crust. This refers to the formation of the earth's crisping over time, meaning the salinity of earth's crust hasn't been changed; however, it's still being formed over time.\n8. Second, the ocean being salty creates a high density, which is what creates the crisping of earth's crisps. This option is correct, but not the best response.\n9. Finally, living beings in the ocean require salt to survive. This explains why living beings have adapted to the high salt levels in the ocean. This would be considered a correct answer.\n10. When reviewing the question, it is evident that 'all of the above' describes how the oceans are salty.\n11. Because of this, Choice E, all of the above", "answer": " 13"}

Choice E, energy, doesn't really fit with the question context.\n8.

Their performance does not give them happiness, but it is a less than pleasant experience, so the person is'suffering' in that sense.\n7. Therefore it is most likely that the context is C: anxiety. \n8. Choice E, \"energetic\", also makes sense.

B, Choice \"B,\" describes a possible reason for inability to solve a math problem as that friend might have asked lots of questions to gain a better understanding.\n6. However, this answer doesn't seem to resonate with the author given that the phrase \"they solved it for\" indicates a more hands-on, active approach, in contrast to \"they ask a lot of questions\" which suggests a more passive approach. \n7.

{"text": "fly anxiety', isn't grammatically correct, nor does it specifically address the question. \n5.

Choices: 1: People need water to stay healthy and alive 2: People need water to function in a healthy way 3: People can withstand long periods without food or shelter 4: Water has a special nutrient in it that people need to keep body  A: choice 1 B: choice 2 C: choice 3 D: choice 4\nRationales: The question asked why humans need water, not any other animals. The word \"need\" implies that it is a requirement for maintaining livelihood.\n\n1. If an individual can survive for long periods without food, or shelter, then water is not a requisite for maintaining their survival. This choice is therefore a contradiction as it states that it is possible to survive without water.\n2. In a water-filled environment, such as an ocean or lake, it would be possible for a person to remain submerged indefinitely without ingesting water. When referring to survival, food is generally essential and in this case of water, it's a contradiction to refer to it as an option.\n3. Shelter is not a \"necessity\" as a person can survive without this, albeit only in a desolate environment exposed to open air.\n4. Although it would be possible for someone to live for an extended period in a desert environment, this does not answer the question, as deserts typically include open air, leaving survival highly dependent on water.\n\nTherefore, answer choice D, is the most correct response.\nAnswer: D, water has a special nutrients in it that everyone needs to keep the body\n\nInput: Where do you typically find a person who has been in the military?

{"text": "flys', refers back to Choice A and doesn't add additional information. \n5. Choice D, Happiness, doesn't mean the person's life is less joyful for not liking performing, suggesting a person can have a talent and still not perform. \n6. Therefore, the most relevant choice is what a person feels when they do perform which can be described as having anxiety or a state of nervousness or excitability. \n7. Therefore, our answer is Choice E: anxiety.\n8. This question also serves as an opportunity to remind ourselves of how to read a sentence in a question. Here, the sentence starts off with 'if', leading us to consider the person has a talent but doesn't enjoy performing. This helps us avoid confusing the sentence's structure with a 'do' type of question where the sentence starts with 'Do\u2026' and makes the answer choice A: 'injury' more relevant.\n\nAnswer: E: anxiety\n\nInput: Which word rhymes with sack?

{"text": "hlies', is a logical fallacy. \n5. Likewise, 'talent persons' cannot enjoy performing, as that implies they are performing. It doesn't state that they do. Choice C, Anxiety', does state that they do perform but is not tied to whether they enjoy it, making it also not valid. \n6. Choice D, \"Happiness\", is not appropriate as it does not directly affect a desire to perform. It is an outward expression of how a person feels, not the basis for a choice or action that may affect a desire. \n7. Choice E, \"enertainment\", is an activity, not a feeling or emotion associated with a decision to perform or not to perform.\n8. Therefore the only possible choice is Choice D, \"Anxiety\" as a person suffering from anxiety may find that their talent allows other options, potentially including performing, and would rather choose something in which they do not have anxiety, to avoid feeling anxiety overall.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: Which of the following people are a member of the same family?

Choice A, A: The father, mother, and siblings is not the correct response as 'brothers' and'sisters' are members of the same family. In this scenario, only the mother is a sister, thus the answer should have more 'family' members.\n3. Option B is wrong as 'brother-in-law' is not a member of the same 'family' as'siblings'.\n4.

Choices: 11 3 9 + ^ = 2 * A: 5 1038 B: 5 25 C D: ^ * 9 + 3 = 2 * 11\nRationales: This question asks what the provided code expresses. A sequence of expressions is provided, which we shall parse to determine the result of the preceding expression (which is what the question is really asking)..\n\n1. In this expression, the right-hand side (RHS) side is \"3\", while the RHS is \"^\".\n2. The left-hand side (LHS) is \"2 + 2\", and the LHS is \u201cx * y =\u201d.\n3. So, using the definition of an exponent, \u201c^\u201d is equal to a number that is to the power of two (2^).\n4. Whenever \u201c2\u201d is multiplied by any non-zero number, it produces a product of one.

It's certainly possible and likely that a performer may suffer from anxiety about performing or being in front of others; however, we want the answer that is the most directly related. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", suggests a performer who is physically and mentally in top-tier condition. This choice feels slightly off in terms of feeling from someone with an internal reservation and is somewhat vague. \n8. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety.

It is easy to eliminate these answers as they do not address the 'talent persons' part of the question. \n7. Therefore, we need to find an answer that specifically references someone with talent performing.\n8. Choice C, anxiety, does not directly reference talent on its own, but implies it could impact someone who has talent. \n9.

Thus, the options remaining are 'anxiety' or 'energetic'.

Choices:  a. give a company gift b. ask to use the bathroom c. act like a robot d. walk in with two bags e. not go to the front desk\nRationales: This is a question about a new employee's strategy to make a new job friendlier to them. Let's get started. Choices A and E are excluded. It's likely that giving a company gift would be the job of a new hire, so E isn't an option. Likewise, walking in with two bags would probably be a new hire's first act to impress their new workmates, meaning a good tactic to try to make friends, so E isn' t an option either. Now we need to get rid of A, \"give a company gift\". This is a choice, as you might try to get to know someone better by bringing them a gift, but that's a strategy new hires shouldn't adopt. Therefore, A is out. Choices C and B are our sole remaining options. As C suggests acting like a robot, it is quite likely that you wouldn't approach the job with such mechanical behavior. Therefore, choice C isn't an option; choice, B, becomes the solution. B. By walking in with two bag, you'll immediately look like a very busy and popular person with a lot of things to complete and therefore a good employee. \nAnswer: B. walk in with two backs.\n\nInput: I've been getting a lot of feedback lately on my writing, most of it has been positive, but I need to learn how to _______ them.

Hence, we can reasonably eliminate Choices A, B, and E, leaving Choices C and D as the next choices to consider. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\" is a psychological reaction, possibly related to a feeling that's too great or an issue with concentration. It could also relate to having stage fright, since stage performance involves putting oneself in the'spotlight'. \n8. Choice D, \"happiness\" is a feeling, indicating it's a subjective reaction and it doesn't relate to having a talent. \n9. The best option is Choice C, \"Anxiety\".

We can also eliminate Choice C, 'anxiety', because anxiety is more of a generalized, nervous feeling and doesn't refer specifically to performing arts. \n7.

Based on the information provided, 'talent' makes sense as this implies that the person is a person of notoriety in their talent area, whether it's singing, dancing or another performance art. \n10. However, we have conflicting information - a person with a talent cannot also, according to the statement, be described as \"energetic\". \n11. If the statement were \"If someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, they cannot also be energetic\", then this would make sense as the talent is not something that someone could choose to be or not be.

{"text": "fly', does not make sense as two negations are impossible together. \n5. Choice D, happiness, might be relevant, but the question implies there is a conflict, so we need to look for a different option. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, could also be a potential answer, but we're not sure whether it's relevant. \n7. Looking at the remaining options, Choice E, 'eager', is not appropriate - being eager is good and we're trying to describe the opposite. \n8. Choice E, on the other hand, is correct, as someone could feel happy if they aren't afraid of performing, and 'energetic' makes little sense in regard of the question as it's not a physical state it's describing but a mental state. \n9. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer to the question is E: emotional. \n10. As we know, the word 'emotional' means \"to have or feel emotions\". \n11. Thus, someone who is emotional would feel a conflict within themselves - they have the talent to perform, but they do not enjoy performing. 12. Since we're talking about an artistic performance, there can be physical manifestations of these emotions - such as butterflies, so we can also infer the answer to be E: emotional and that these manifestations would be 'butterflies in the stomach'.\n\nAnswer: E: emotional and butterflies in the belly\n\nInput: An apple's shape is not as well suited for long distance throwing as a ball. Choices:  A::round B: circular C: elongated D: egg-shaped E: cylindrical\nRationales: The question is making an assertion about the design of an apple and its limitations. We are asked to decide which of the given options is the least suited to long distance throwing.\n\nChoices A and B are both circular, which implies they would go the same distance when thrown. If anything, these shapes are similar in their shapes, while B is more round than A.\n\nChoices C and D are similarly suited, with D being more elongated, indicating its potential advantage for throwing.\n\nThus, the best answer is (D)\n\nAnswer: D: egg sh", "answer": " 6"}

Choice D, happiness and Choice E, energy, are irrelevant possibilities for the person described in the sentence as they do not refer to the emotional feelings.\n6. We are left with Choice C: anxiety, which most closely matches the implied description of the scenario. \n7. However, as anxiety is not specific to performance arts, we can eliminate it, narrowing down the choices to B and E.\n8. E refers to the emotion of 'butterflies', which is more specific to Choice C, so by eliminating it, the answer is then Choice B, 'anxiety'.\n9. The answer isn't C. In fact, anxiety is likely to affect someone's performance by hindering their ability to express themselves as they should. But it isn't that the person can't enjoy performing at all - it's that the anxiety affects their ability to do their best. \n10. Choice E is a logical non sequitur as the person is 'talent' and a 'talent person' is not able to suffer from injury and buttterflies at the same time. \n11.

Choices B and D are incorrect, both referring to actions the girl might engage in as the sun goes down. \n2. Choice C should be ruled out because she's thinking too much about finishing the race. \n3. Option E is wrong because she's too tired to get the answer right. \n4.

The young man's pant is either white, green, tan or orange. \n7. Orange doesn't make any sense, considering the context and nature of the choices. \n8. Option B is most likely to be blue, since blue isn't explicitly mentioned as a pant color. \n9. The other choices, M, B, Y, and D, represent the four options that may make the most sense in the context. \n10.

Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', are both relevant to anxiety issues in general, as they are a form of emotion. We want to focus on the form of emotion that seems more fitting for this context. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", is a very broad term and not specific enough to the scenario provided.\n8.

{"text": "fly' also doesn't make sense, due to the fact that talent people are expected to display their talents to a crowd, which is inherently a public stage performance. \n5. Similarly, Choice C, 'anxiety' doesn't make sense as it does not explain why someone might not like performing and not suffer from anxiety as a result. \n6. Choice D, \"happiness\" doesn't make sense because it appears that the performer likes performing in general, at least to some degree, rather than it being a cause-and-effect situation. \n7. Choice E, \"energetic\", implies that the answer should be something that energizes people rather than makes them nervous or anxious.\n8.

Choice A, \"engineering\", is not related to psychology, so it's not a valid choice. \n2. Choice B, \"sales\", seems to make sense as a possible field of expertise for psychology, however we must consider that sales is not a job that can be performed psychologically. As it is an occupation that requires a specific skillset (e.g. negotiation, verbal persuasion, etc) that is often not related to psychology. \n3.

Thus, there is a correlation between anxiety and performance.\n7. Thus, we are left with choices E and D.\n8. While it's true that happiness and performances arts do not necessarily go together, the idea is that the person's discomfort does not stem from unhappiness, per se, so it does not make sense to choose this answer. \n9.

However, 'happiness' is broad topic in itself that may not directly affect performing talent.\n6. Hence, two choices, left are B: injury and E: energetic. \n7. Choice B: injury is the most suitable description for a person whose natural talent is in performing, but suffers from a reservation relating to performing. \n8.

It is immediately apparent that 'the principal' fits the description of the person accountable for these circumstances, indicating that this is the correct choice.\n2. 'The office' is unlikely to be entrusted with these responsibilities, as it is generally the person's job to conduct office administration rather than to care for children.\n3.

Both choice B, 'talent person can suffer from injury and buttterflies', and choice C, 'talent person cannot suffer from injury and anxiety', can be ruled out because both include a psychological constriction. \n8. Choice B, however, does not make sense within this context as 'injury and butterflies' is unlikely a psychological constraining factor, unless it refers to something relating to physical harm. \n9. Therefore, choice C is the best answer.\nAnswer: C talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety.\n\nInput: What sort of personality best describes someone who's really hard to shop for? Choices: A: unsociable B: stingy C: selfish D: extravagant E: generous\nRationales: The question is asking what a typical personality is of someone hard to shop for.\n\nConsider this sentence: A stingy person will have trouble spending money on themselves. This makes it obvious that the answer does not mean \"extravagant\".\n\nThe sentences in this question give more information. A selfish person will spend a lot of their time trying to get what they want regardless of the situation or people around them.\nAn extravagant person may not know what they want, and therefore can be hard to shop for. There may be things that they will buy out of curiosity, but they're still easy to shop for.\nA generous person is willing to spend their money on others, even if they don't get anything in return. There is not much risk with them because whatever gift they buy, they'll try to find a reason to give it to you, even if they didn't have to.\nGivers and receivers make unbalanced people, but the person described in the question is unbalanced.\nThis makes selfish the best answer.\n\nAnswer: C: Selfish\n\nInput: If you are trying to find the owner of a phone number, what kind of information might be necessary", "answer": " 112"}
{"text": "fly', while seeming plausible, is likely just an incorrect grammar choice, and would be better stated as 'personal talent can't cause an injury. There shouldn't be a 'butterfly' either. \n5. Choice E, \"An anxiety\" isn't correct. There is no anxiety being referred to in the question. \n6. Choice D, \"Happiness is the reason someone wouldn't be able to perform\". \n7. Choice C, Happiness \"Personal talent can't make you feel happy'. Again, the context refers to performance arts like singing or dancing, not a personal talent itself. The question is asking what the person isn't excited about, not what the performance art can't do. \n8. Choice B, \"Anxiety\". This might be a possibility. We know someone is describing a person with a talent but also someone who isn't excited about performing that talent. So, there must be something that prevents them from performing. It's possible that the person is anxious, but also that there isn't anything else to the question that makes this a good fit. For example, maybe there could be more detail, or another option. \n9. Looking, Choice A, 'Injury'. Injury doesn't seem to be a feasible answer, unless there is some unstated problem that hasn't been revealed to us. So, we can eliminate A and B. \n10. If someone is talented but doesn't like to perform, the talent itself is likely not the issue. Choice A, Injury should be eliminated.\n11.

No, Choice D should be eliminated. \n13. If someone possesses a talent but finds no joy in performing, could that be from some combination of Anxiety and Happiness?

Choice D, \u2018happiness\u2019, fails to indicate that the person does not want to perform. \n6. Choice B, \u2018anxiety and energy\u2019, refers to a feeling, rather than a dislike of performance art. \n7. Thus, the most reasonable choice would be Choice E: 'energetic', which is also related somewhat to talent as an energetic person may be particularly gifted.\n\nAnswer: E: energetic", "answer": " 324"}
{"text": "fly', which refers to butterflies, doesn't seem to fit either, though the latter part of the phrase is an antonym of 'talent'.\n5. Choice D, happiness, similarly doesn't fit as a talent person could still display immense talent accompanied by feelings of happiness.\n6. That leaves us with Choice E and Choice C. \n7. Considering the context, the phrase 'energetic' has a positive connotation, whereas 'anxiety' carries a negative one. Choice C 'happiness' has both positive and negative connotations, however, it does not seem to accurately describe the given scenario either. Choice E 'energetic' is the most fitting, as it means having the ability to create energy. Thus, someone who is talent, but who doesn't enjoy performing probably suffers from a fear of messing up or of performing in a manner that does not demonstrate optimal ability.\n8.

{"text": "fly', is not consistent with the statement of the question: a person with a talent for performing could possibly not enjoy performing without suffering any personal injury.\n5. Similarly, Choice C, 'anxiety', doesn't sound correct here either, as it does not specifically concern the idea of performing. It also seems to be an unconscionable restriction on a person. For example, who is to say that a person cannot have talent in acting, singing or dancing while also exhibiting anxiety?\n6. Choice D, \"happiness,\" is a bit contradictory as it's related to performance art in the sense that one's happiness can rise if the performance is well-received by others, but that doesn't mean the individual themselves can't experience anxiety.\n7. Choices B, C and D all relate to the individual's state of mind, while choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't fit, as the question is implying that they have talent, but also doesn't like performing. In that case, they already have the energy required to perform justifiably, so it wouldn't make sense to label them as \"energetic\".\n8. Therefore, we are left with option D: Happiness.\nAnswer: D. Happiness.\n\nInput: Which of the following is more common, to feel anger?

{"text": "flys', implies that everyone who is truly talented should always be enjoying performing, as though performing is their sole reason for even existing. This doesn't make much logical sense. \n5. Choice D, happiness, seems to contradict the notion that talent persons generally only suffer from anxiety when performing, and happiness would be an outlier on that scale. \n6. Choice D, anxiety, could be a potential option as it would be somewhat related to talent persons performing poorly, and they might feel some level of anxiety or nervousness as a result of their performance, though such feelings might not always be related to a lack of enjoyment. This would be a potential answer. \n7. However, there is an implied possibility mentioned in the last part of the question; 'but they cannot suffer from happiness and butterflies'. This implies that there is an alternative to happiness for talent persons, perhaps something that is related to them but not in a positive way. \n8. Hence, we can eliminate choice D, anxiety, as an answer choice as it is contradicted by the mention of 'butterflies'.\n9. Considering the two choices that are left, we find them both to be plausible answers. Considering their meanings, choice C, 'anxiety' is a mental condition that refers to 'emotionally distressing feelings and physical tension'. As such, it fits well in the context of the question and can explain how a talent person who doesn't enjoy performing might experience anxiety-related feelings.\n10. Meanwhile, Choice E, 'energetic' is a mental state that refers to a very high level of energy and mental enthusiasm, which might be related to anxiety and other mental conditions as well. \n11.

{"text": "fly', may seem correct at first, but actually doesn't make sense because it is a literal inversion of another clause and does not match up with the structure of the question or the sentence. \n5.

Choice C,  'anxiety', and Choice E,  'energy', can be ruled out for the same reason as 'happiness' and 'energetic', respectively. \n7. Looking at only 'talent' and 'anxiety' we see that 'talking nonsenses' is more plausible. \n8.

Therefore, the sentence should read 'When you put your dog outside, in the cold, and you just let it be....'\nNext we are going to cross off any words between cold and be in the sentence that are not part of that sentence and are not referring to what a specific word or group of words is referring to. \nThe following words or phrases can be eliminated. \nThese words or phrases can all be eliminated because they are either irrelevant and they do not make sense with", "answer": " 100"}

Choice E, happiness, is also incorrect. Although being happy about performing would make someone likely to perform, a happier performance does not indicate a talent. \n6. Choice D, anxiety, is the correct choice. Anxiety is a psychological condition that may impact one's ability to perform. Anxiety, however, is not necessary for a person to perform.\n7. Choices B and C, injury and butterfly, and happiness and energetic, are similarly redundant. These two choices mean something along the lines of \"talent persons cannot suffer\" if someone has these symptoms, and if someone suffers from these things they are likely talent persons. In other words, these choices are meant to cover the idea of \"if someone is talent, they cannot have injury, butterflys or happiness, or be energetic\".\n8. In short, the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety.\n\n### ANSWERS\n\n### Demo:\nInput: The scientist started out with simple question that could be answered more simply.\nRationales: The scientist didn't ask the right question to begin with. He asked the wrong question, and he was therefore left with the wrong hypothesis.\nThe correct answer is B: he wanted to do math.\n\nInput: We were able to answer this question using math, and as a result, we had what?\nRationales: Because we were able to answer the question with math, we learned what we didn't already know before we started.\nThe correct answer here is C: better understanding.\n\nInput: I was looking for a person by the name of Tom. Where should I look?\nRationales The scientist would do best looking in Michigan. Michigan is a location rather than the name of a person, and this would therefore be a more specific answer.\nMichigan is also a place where people can be found, unlike the other choices listed that aren't. It makes logical sense that, given what we are looking for, Michigan would be a better location to look.\nThe correct answer in this case is D: phone book\nAnswer: D: Phonebook", "answer": " 18"}

Answer A and B are incorrect because neither of them can have \"the company\" be \"no money from this company\" or \"only 60 percent of new total company\".2. Answer C is incorrect because \"the company\" would have to be the entire purchase price. It needs to be in addition to, not subtracted from, \"only 60 % of the new total company\". There should be no negative values in the answer.3. Answer D is incorrect because the company was the entire acquisition (this acquisition was not measured in terms of the \"the number of new company\" (A+B)).

Choice D, \"happiness\" is not an emotion but a state of being, which does not necessarily relate to performance anxiety. Choice E, \"energy\" is also incorrect as it does not describe an emotional situation. \n6. Finally, Choice C, \"anxiety\" is an appropriate answer as it refers to an emotional state that is commonly felt in performance situations. \n7.

{"text": "fly,' is not well stated and doesn't provide a true, viable answer. \n5. Choice D,  'happiness' doesn't really relate to the question as someone who is happy generally would be interested in putting on shows.\n6. Choices C, A and D, 'talent', are probably relevant as they suggest the person in question has, or could have, a talent related to a performance art.\n7. Finally, looking at Choice E, 'anxiety', this can cause people to have a mental reservation, specifically related to performing, which doesn't seem to be a problem for this person. Thus, this choice best fits the given information.\nAnswer: E. anxiety\n\nInput: What type of people would most definitely be interested in playing basketball? Choices:  C: tall people D: athletes that want to run a fast race E: those who like to walk F: those who hate to be late\nRationales: The question does not state that these people would have to play basketball. Thus, there is no requirement for the player to play. \nThere are different types of players and different types of games \nThose that are athletic would qualify, but so would those like to walk or hate to be late.\nThe question does not refer to the people that play basketball, but to those that are considered to be most definitely interested in playing basketball. \nTall people could be interested, but more athletic people that are not tall, for example, would also be interested in playing basketball.\nThus, the better answer is D, athletes that want to play a fast game \nAthletes include more than tall people, and since athletic people that play basketball would be a fast game, choosing A doesn't make sense \nChoice E is incorrect because people who like to walk, especially in a fast race, would still qualify, even if the question refers to those who like to walk.\nThus, Choice D is the best answer, due to the athletes who like to play a fast game.\n\nAnswer: D: athletes that like to play a fast race.\n\nInput: What did the professor say to their students at the beginning of the class?

{"text": "fly', is also not true as they can certainly feel butterflies in their stomach before a performance.\n5. Choices C and D both are related to emotions that could be triggered before performing and can lead to a feeling of not wanting to perform. Therefore, these are plausible explanations.\n6. However, choice E, 'energetic,' would not likely relate to a feeling of not being good enough to perform.\n7. Hence, we can eliminate choices C and D and can focus on C and E. \n8. Comparing their context, C, 'anxiety' seems more fitting as it is not necessarily an indication of a dislike for performance as much as a reluctance due to a fearful or negative expectation.\n9. E, 'energetics,' refers to emotions or feelings, which are more likely to have something to do with a negative self-perception, rather than a feeling of not wanting or not being good enough to do something.\n10. So, choice B, 'anxiety,' is the most likely answer.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: I tried to buy some eggs on the store, I didn't find any. What did I do? Choices: 1: bought 2: eggs 3: ran out 4: didn't look carefully 5: stopped at other stores\nRationales: The question asks what the person in fact did when they tried to buy eggs in a store but didn't find any (because the store didn't have any eggs). The only choice that makes sense is 'bought' because the person was clearly trying to buy eggs.

Choice D, \"happiness\", does not pertain to a mental deterrence towards performing.\n7. The remaining choice is Choice E, 'anxiety'. This makes sense, as anxiety can in fact cause mental and emotional obstacles that would prevent someone from performing.\n8.

Hurricanes are less likely to occur in some areas 6. Hurricanes come from the equator 7. Are a low pressure area in the upper atmosphere 8. Hurricanes form as a large group of storms 9. Are a type of extreme weather\nRationales: Choice 2 is inaccurate because lakes and rivers do not cause hurricanes. Choice 4 is inaccurate since hurricane do not occur where more than 50 percent of the tropical zone is occupied. Choices 1 and 4 are incorrect, as hurricanes form as weather systems primarily because of water temperature. This leads to Choice 3 being incorrectly listed as a fact. Choices 1, 4, and 9 are facts but 1 and 9 both concern winds that are related to hurricanes. This leaves Choice 5 to be incorrect since there are other areas with low probability of hurricane formation.\n\nAnswer: Choice 6.\n\nInput: What can be done to increase the amount of water found in a human body?

The choice that makes the most sense in this context is Choice C, anxiety, as the question infers that the root issue is not just a simple unwillingness to perform.

Since the options provided are not even numbers, only, 1, 4, or 6, all of which would not be a multiple so our choices must include being a multiple also, leaving us with: 1, 4 or 6.

B: time 3. C: sunlight 4. D: darkness 5. E: space\nRationales: (NOTE: the question says 'How does a plant grow tall?' 7. What determines whether a plant grows tall or not, it's necessary to look at 1. the environment in which it is growing, 2. the specific plant, and 3. the plant at different times and stages of growth. 4. For example, the time factor can be important when determining whether and how fast a plant will grow. 5. At different stages of life a plant also grows differently, and those differences can indicate how tall a plant will ultimately be. Given this information, the question can be rephrased as follows: 'Which of the following factors determine whether a plant grows tall and/or how tall it will ultimately be?' 6. This means looking at each of the choices as to whether it applies to 1. the environment, 2. the plant, and 3.'time and stages of growth' to determine where the answer lies. 7.

{"text": "flys' is a sentence fragment. \n5. Choice E, an overdramatization of a situation. If a person is talented and enjoys performing, they may have butterflies beforehand, but 'energetic' is exaggeration. Additionally, the word order makes it seem the person is also experiencing an injury.\n6. Choices C and D are both relevant because anxiety and happiness are potential mental states, making them potential explanations. \n7. As a person with a talent that doesn't enjoy performing may have both anxiety or happiness, both options seem correct. Thus, one cannot choose between C or D.\n8. In this case, it's best to review all the choices one by one.\n9. Looking at D: happiness first, it seems like a reasonable answer. \n10. If a person has a talent but doesn't enjoy performing, they may not necessarily suffer from anxiety.\n11. Looking at C: anxiety doesn't make sense if the person is not experiencing an injury either. This indicates that since an anxiety issue is mentioned in the question and injury isn't, it is more likely that no anxiety exists.\n12. Therefore, the best choice is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C.

As such, the right answer to the above question can only be an emotion.\n3. Consider each choice individually in order to better understand the correct answer.\n4. Choices I and II, depression and anxiety, are negative emotions and are not the most plausible outcomes of becoming angry. If one is depressed or anxious, chances are they were already those emotions. Thus, they cannot be a result of becoming angry. \n5.

Choices C and E, anxiety and 'energetic', respectively, seem plausible possibilities, though anxiety has a negative connotation and doesn't seem to be the only deterring factor in the question's given circumstance. \n7. These two choices, however, are still unanswered. \n8. Therefore, we continue to use reasoning to narrow down the options. \n9. Considering Choices C and E together, we can note that anxiety and 'energized' do not make sense since they go against each other. \n10. Considering Choices B and E together, we find that 'talent persons cannot undergo injury and butterflying', is not an answer, as 'butterflying' is not an option. \n11. In this way, Chooses C and E are eliminated. \n12. Therefore, Choice B is the most appropriate answer, as it is the one that best fits the implied reservation in the question. \n13.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as a talent is a subjective opinion about someone's aptitude, but 'butterfly' refers to an emotion or feeling. In addition, the sentence 'talent persons cannot' suggests that someone with a talent suffers from butterflies. This makes no sense, and this choice should also be eliminated. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", is similarly irrelevant, as happiness isn't a feeling specific to performing. \n6. Next we should compare Choices C, 'anxiety', and Choice E, 'energetic'. \n7. Choice C, anxious feels appropriate, as anxiety is a state that causes nervousness or distress, which is indicative of someone who is reluctant or afraid to perform.\n8. Choice E, energetic, feels odd. While a \"performer\" could exhibit high levels of energy, this is not always the case. For instance, someone who performs music may choose to do so with little energy, and someone who performs theatre may do it with a lot of energy. In either case, the choice of emotion does not match the choice of person. Therefore, a more accurate choice would be C: anxious.\n9.

Choices: \n  * A: milk\n  * B: oil\n  * C: eggs\n  * D: sugar\n  * E: salt\nRationales:\n1. The question is regarding a recipe to feed neighbors, which implies two types of needs. (1) a necessary food requirement, and (2) some type of drink.\n2. The list of possible ingredients provided has certain quantities required, which will be sufficient for many neighbors to consume.\n3. It's important note that the need is what the ingredients are, not whether it is possible to feed the neighbors with that much.\n4. Hence, Choice A:'milk' and Choice E:'salt' have been rejected because they don't serve the primary requirement of the context.\n5. Similarly, Choice B: 'oil' and Choice D:'sugar' are not necessary, so can be eliminated.\n6. Choices C: 'eggs' and F:'salt' are not necessary either - but eggs only have two required units, which means they might not be sufficient unless used as a secondary ingredient.\n7. As a matter of fact, most people consume eggs in combination with milk, breads or meat, which are primary ingredients that are mentioned here.\n8. Therefore the best options would be Choice F:'salt', and Choice A: 'Milk'.\nAnswer: A: milk  F: salt\n\nInput: How was the man able to find a seat on the bus without making an effort after all the other seats were taken?

Choice D, though on the surface seems logical, is incorrect because as stated in the question we are looking for some discomfort that prevents this person from performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, makes sense as if the person has anxiety about performing, they might avoid performing as it'd cause them too much stress. \n7. Choice E, happiness and energetic, are inappropriate because joy and energy make performing a pleasure and not a problem, therefore, these answers don't fit.\n8.

Therefore, by eliminating irrelevant choices, we are left with two options, where both D and B are relevant. \n7. Based on the other question options, it appears that this talent person would have a psychological issue preventing them from enjoying performing. \n8. Choice B, anxiety, is an appropriate answer, as this is a psychological disorder that can prevent someone from performing well and enjoying the experience.\nAnswer: B: an anxiety\n\nInput: A person who enjoys singing and wants to make money, is likely to become who? Choices: . . .  A: performer B: star C: teacher D: writer E: artist\nRationales: The question asks for what type of art is most likely for a person who enjoys singing who wants to make money.\n1. A singer who wants to make money from singing can become one or more of the options, which are performer, star, teacher, writer, and artist.\n2. Choice C, teacher, is ruled out because a teacher doesn't need to be paid to teach.\n3. Choices E, artist, and B, star, mean the same thing.\n4. Choices D, writer, and A, performer, also mean the same thing. Since the student can become a writer or performer, Choice B is the correct option.\nAnswer: B, star\n\nInput: To learn math, you need to be ________ and patient. Choices:  A. B. C. D. E.

Choices:  C: apple D: dollar E: pair of shoes F: book\nRationales: This is word problem, that means we must identify all numbers here. \n1. If we have:\n* My father - my dad\n* gave me - he gave\n* an apples, a books, a pairs of shoes and a dollars - for each of the object, we have two type of object. The first name of the object is given by the noun that follow it, and the second name of the object is the following thing in the list - that is why we have a book, a pairs of shooes and a dollars.\n2. Now, we have to decide who got the items first.\n3. For each of the object, ask if we have only numbers or only units.\n4. Each of the object is given after a verb. 'a' indicates a noun. 'pair of' indicates what type of nouns is coming. For example, a pairs of shoess means two shoes. 'pairs of shoes' is the plural form of shoe. So, in the sentence: I have two dollars, we mean 2 $s (we put's'after every unit). If we have two shoes, we mean two pairs of shoes. 'Apple' means one apple. 'a book' means one book. 'a dollar' means one dollar. 'a pair of shoes' means two pairs of shoes. So, after we know that: We have to decide", "answer": " 20"}

Choice E, happiness, isn't related to performing and does not logically relate to having anxiety about performing. \n6. Choices C, 'Anxiety', and D, 'Energy', are both related to performing, suggesting that if someone does not enjoy performing, they must suffer from one or both of these issues. \n7. Therefore, both options C & D are acceptable answers, but if we look more closely at the context of the question, the person in question most likely struggles with anxiety about performing, as opposed to an issue with energy. \n8. Hence, the answer is C: Anxiety.\nAnswer: C : Anxiety.\n\nInput: What type of insect can't change its shape? Choices:  S: butterfly B: dragonfly D: all of the above F: none of the above E: fly\nRationales:1. The question asks the type of insect that cannot change its shape, giving us two options: all of the above and none of the above.\n2. Looking at each choice, we can eliminate irrelevant possibilities.\n3. Choices 'S' and 'D', 'S' for butterfly and 'D' for dragonfly are not correct, since both of them can change their shape (butterflies hide by curling up, and dragonflies change color).\n4. Choice 'E' for fly is correct, as flies cannot change their shape.\n\nInput: If an alien species invaded Earth, what would Earthlings do? Choices:  C: attack the aliens D: help one alien E: run away F: fight a battle\nRationales: In order to choose the best possible answer from a list, we need to first understand the situation, and consider which answer makes the most logical sense. \nHere we are presented with two alien species and given the choice of what we could do.\n* Choice 'C - attack the aliens' is not really relevant here. If we fight the aliens, then the aliens are no longer aliens and they will no longer be invading Earth.\n* Choice D, 'Help one", "answer": " 200"}

However, it does match up with the other options, so it's a good choice. \n7. Choice C, Anxiety, seems to be the best option because if someone isn't performing, that can possibly cause them to worry or to not want to be in the spotlight. \n8.

{"text": "flies', is the exact phrasing of the given question and is thus not really an answer. \n5. Choice A, also is not really an answer. It simply lists an injury without explaining why it is considered to be a psychological issue. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, has a direct relation to performing, since performing arts inherently require stage fright, among other forms of anxiety. This choice is thus appropriate. \n7. Choice A, happiness, is not a reservation about performing. In fact, it is the opposite. Happiness is a feeling of pleasure; a feeling of contentment and pleasure is an attitude suitable for people who do like performing.\n8.

{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense in the context of injury as 'butterfly' has no meaning and doesn't add anything to the original phrase. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't support the conclusion that the person must suffer, as 'happy' typically indicates the feeling or condition of being happy. Thus, if the person were happy, they would be fine with performing. \n6. Choice F, 'energetic', doesn't provide an answer as pertains to whether the person suffers or enjoys a performance, as energetic could suggest they enjoy performing or it could imply they do not. \n7. There fore, the best answer is Choice B, 'anxiety'.\n8. Anxiety is a mental block or impediment that can impact how someone performs in certain situations. For a person with anxiety, performing could potentially cause them to experience increased anxiety. 8.

{"text": "fliess', doesn't make sense as it is a statement that it is impossible for a person to have injury, butterflies, and anxiety at the same time, and it is not relevant to the question. \n5. Looking at choice C, 'anxiety', we need to evaluate whether this is the right answer. Anxiety is usually caused by the fear or stress of what might happen in a particular situation. However, this question asks about a situation in which someone is unable to perform a talent and suffers from anxiety. This doesn't make sense since the individual has no control over this situation and shouldn't have any stress about it either. Furthermore, there is nothing about anxiety that speaks specifically to an inability to perform talent.\n6. Choices D and E, 'happiness' and 'energy', are similar to choice C, 'an anxiety'. The phrase 'happiness and butterflies' doesn't make logical sense. Furthermore, none of these terms explicitly relate to suffering from the inability to perform a talent.\n7.

{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense. 'Suffer from injury' implies physical pain, whereas 'butterflys' refers to something psychological. \n5.

Choice C, anxiety, is the most applicable, as it denotes concern over the prospect of performing and could cause a lack of enjoyment.

Choices:  C: maybe, but maybe not.\nRationales:\n1. This question asks if an ice cream cone, if left outside, will melt.\n2. An ice cream cone is made of a cold, frozen substance that when it comes in direct contact with the heat of human touch will melt.\n3.

The wording of the question says that \"you were to go on a trip from London, England to somewhere in the USA, \" but a map wouldn't necessarily be needed to go on a trip. The wording of this question tells us that someone is planning a trip.\n2. If you are planning a trip, or you are going somewhere else entirely, that requires you to travel. But in order to be able to travel to a destination, there must exist a map to follow, or to plot your travel paths. We need a map to see where we are going, and a compass to determine our direction.", "answer": " 16"}

E: brain\nRationales: This is an instruction where the response has to describe a body part in which all vital signs appear.\n1. Vital signs are the basic health measurements you take, they are usually your temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing rate.\n2. Looking at choice A, 'heart' doesn't fit with the question as your heart doesn't really house all your vital signs.\n3. Choices B & C 'chest' and'skin' are both incorrect because they do not house vital signs, as vital signs come from the heart, your blood pressure, heart rate and breathing rate are affected by the whole body and not just one part.\n4. If we look at all the given options, B & C are both incorrect. Choices D & E, \u2018mind\u2019 and \u2018brain\u2019 don\u2019t make sense because they don\u2019t house vital signs.\n5.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect as it does not relate to the question and is quite grammatically confusing. \n5. Choice D' happiness is not a psychological reason for not enjoying performing because while happiness can be an emotion related to a particular activity, it isn't directly linked to it the way anxiety and butterflies are.\n6. With the remaining three choices, they do relate to psychological reasons for not enjoying performing, which suggests the likely answer. \n7. Choice B, anxiety, is a relatively common mental health disorder that can cause a person to feel an intense level of nervousness before potentially harmful events. When considering the anxieties surrounding performing, it is a possible mental health issue that might lead to this behavior. It seems like the best option.\n8. Therefore the answer is B: anxiety.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: A person who has a tendency to break things is prone to what? Choices: A: bad luck B: inactivity C: procrastination D: perfectionism E: carelessness\nRationales:1. The question asks about someone who tends to break things a lot, what this trait might suggest about this person, including the possibility of their having other related traits.\n2. Out of the options given, only choices A, B and D fit.\n3. Choices B and D are not relevant to the question as they do not suggest other related characteristics (such as carelessness).\n4. Choice A, \"bad luck\", does not match the question statement as it does not have any relation to breaking things.\n5. Choices C and E, \"perfectionism\" and \"carelessness,\" respectively, both relate to things being broken. In some cases, carelessness can cause things to break, but these attributes do not match the original wording of the question.\n6. Choices A, B and D all fit, with option D' procrastination, being the likely choice because it relates closely with the trait of breaking things. Procrastinating can cause someone to avoid tasks they find anxiety-inducing, which makes them breakable.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: procrastination.\nAnswer: D : procrastination", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as butterflies are not an illness or disorder that one can suffer from.\n5. Choices C, 'ANXIETY' and D, 'happiness,' are psychological states of mind, and would apply to the scenario if the person had issues with their performance in addition to their dislike. Choice E, \"energetic\" is a trait that is normally associated with those who are more \"physically active\", meaning it doesn't fit.\n6. So, of the remaining options, only Choice E 'anxiety', fits the question requirements.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: anxiety\nAnswer: E: Anxiety", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "fly', suggests that performers can't experience any kinds of physical discomfort and doesn't relate to a psychological state. \n5.

Choice E, \"energetic,\" doesn't align with the overall context of the question, as a person being inefficient does not correlate with anxiety.\n8. Therefore the best answer to this question is C: anxiety. \nAnswer: C: anger \n\nInput: __________ (the word) is what the first letter is next? Choices:  a: h b: o c: i d: g e: c\nRationales: Let's start by looking at the choices. \n\nThe first choice is A, 'h', which does not follow the rule that the first word should follow the first letter. It is not the best answer.\n\nThe second choice, B, 'o', is a little trickier to figure out. At first it seems to follow the rule, but if you look at all the letters next to the letter A, they are all vowels, and all are in the incorrect direction. You should look for a consonant following the rule. It's not the best answer. \n\nThe third choice, C, 'i', is a little more obvious. It's a consonant following a consonant, making it a good answer. It's the best choice.\n\nThe fourth choice, D, 'g', definitely does not work. It does not follow the rule at all. It's definitely not a good choice.\n\nThe fifth choice, E, 'c', is also a good choice, but it just doesn't make sense with the context. \n\nTherefore, the best answer to this problem is C: i.\n\nAnswer: C: i. \n\nInput: Which option is NOT a part of the English language?

Choices: 1 A: digest, 2 B: float, 3 C: walk, 4 D: fly 5 E: drink\nRationales:1. The answer requires understanding the relationship between a bird and how they obtain nutrition.\n2. Choice A, \"digest\", isn't specific enough. A bird wouldn't be expected to digest, as this is a mammal trait rather than a bird trait.\n3. Choices B, \"float\", isn't a way in which birds obtain nutrition, as birds typically do not float.\n4. Choices C, \"walk\", isn't a natural way for a bird to eat, as they eat in flight.\n5. Choices D, \"fly\", refers to birds' natural way of acquiring food. \n6. However, in order to answer, we also need to understand the question at the bottom of the question, which asks about the relationship between a bird an how they acquire nutrition. Here, the phrases \"what ways?\" and \"what ways?\" are intended to identify the ways that a bird can survive, meaning to answer this question one must identify the specific types of nutrition that a bird needs to acquire.\n7. Consider choice E, \"drink,\" which is the process by which birds acquire water from their surroundings, it makes sense.\n8. Another possible answer could be option C, \"walk,\" as birds often drink as they walk or fly.\n9. Thus, the best answer is: E, drink/C, walk\nAnswer: 4: Walk\n\nInput: If I want to go to a sports event, I would get which kind of ticket?", "answer": " 700"}
{"text": "fly', is too specific. It also doesn't seem to address the issue at hand, as the question is about suffering from anxiety due to the reservation about performing.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness', describe an emotional state, but are too general to sufficiently address the issue at hand.\n6. Option E, 'energetic', is too general as it does not address the question.\n7. The remaining answer choice is C, 'anxious'. \n8. Because anxiety refers to fear, it describes the person's mental reservation, or butterflies, about performing. \n9. Therefore, we can safely choose C - 'Anxiety'. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: Who is responsible for maintaining a person's mental health? Choices: \n A: everyone that person meets B: the general public C: their friends and family D: the government E: nobody\nRationales:1. The question is, who is responsible for maintaining an individual's mental health? 2. Looking at the options for choice A: \"everyone that person meets\", this is too general and doesn't describe an individual's friends and family, or even their friends or their family. 3.\nAlso, looking at Choice B:\"the general public\" this could also include strangers. 4. Looking at Choice C' \"the friends and family\", this makes sense since friends and family can be considered responsible for mentally supporting a person. 5. Looking at Choice D\"the government\", this makes sense if the government has provided support for mental health awareness programs, for instance. 6. Looking at Choice E\"nobody\", this makes sense if there have been no awareness programs to support someone with mental health problems or mental conditions. 7. Therefore, we can choose the best answer: C' \"their friends and family\".\nAnswer: C: their friends and famly\n\nInput: If a person works out, it is important for them to maintain strength while having a balance between what two different types of exercises?

As anxiety is a common result of a performance, it could be a barrier to the person performing. \n8.

When I asked for a recommendation, the librarian advised me to use the? Choices: A: the internet B: the catalog C: the card catalog D: the card\nRationales:\n1. The card catalog is a traditional method of searching a library\u2019s index for a book. A library is generally considered a database of books.\n2. The Internet could be a source, but the key point here is that the librarian recommends it.\n3. The catalog or the card catalog are the librarian\u2019s recommendations and thus are better choices.\n4. The librarian is correct that the card is preferred over the catalog, as a catalog is a list of books, whereas the card contains detailed descriptions of books and is more organized.\n5. This is relevant to the text because the author is seeking a specific book or set of books by an author, not just any published work or any author.\n6. Thus, the author wants to know where to look for books by an author who wrote a specific number of works within a particular time period.\n7. The card catalog allows for detailed indexing of authors, books, and years of publication.\n8. So, the best answer is Choice: B; the catalog.\nAnswer:", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": "fly', does not make any sense and doesn't follow any grammar rules either. Thus, we can eliminate it. \n5. Choices C and E, anxiety D, happiness, mean the person would either be anxious, or happy to perform, and thus don't make logical sense in the context. \n6. In Choice B, a person can suffer the physical injury of a nervous system, the symptoms of which include butterflies in the stomach. This leads us to believe that the correct answer is Choice C, because by extension, someone can suffer anxiety regardless of their talents or performance habits. \n7. Anything that would cause anxiety, or keep one from performing, is likely to be referred to as a 'block'. Since the given individual does have a talent, this would mean they have something that prevents them from fulfilling their potential.\n8. Therefore the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: All birds are capable of flapping their wings, but in order to fly, a bird needs to have a second item, what? Choices: A: weight (in terms of mass) B: feathers C: air D: sticks E: trees\nRationales: The question is asking what a second object that a bird needs, and the correct answer is Choices C: air. \nBy examining the other choices, we know that a bird does not need weight in terms of mass, as it can already use its weight for flapping and balance. A bird does not need feathers to fly. Flying does not require sticks or trees, and while it is true that a bird needs air for flying, it also requires feathers to fly without any other support or equipment.\nAnswer: C, air\n\nInput: What item is placed on top of the Christmas tree when it is erected?

{"text": "fly's', is unclear at first. However, once we understand it is a play on the phrase \"talent on ice\" it's clear that it's not related to the question at all. \n5.

Choice C, anxiety, does make sense, as anxiety is a common cause of emotional blockage in people who dislike performing. \n7. Choice E, energetic, does not make sense as people with energy are likely those who would pursue performing in the first place. \n8.

Choices:  a) a man's place is on the field; he is not supposed to be inside the house b) A family should get as close to nature as possible c) I work at my computer d) I use a car more than once a week\nRationales: For this question, you need to identify what people usually mean when they say \"home is where the heart is.\" After that, you can answer correctly.\n1. The phrase, \"home is where the [heart] is\", commonly implies that where someone lives is where their heart/soul/spirits is. It is a saying that implies the comfort one feels in their home and the sense of belonging one feels there.\n2. Choice A, \"A man's place is at the field. He should not be hanging out at home\", does not mean the same concept as the one in the question. This choice suggests that the phrase has to do with a man and his role in society.\n3. Choices B and D, referring to getting as close to nature as family and working on a computer respectively, don't make sense - the idea of this phrase is not about nature.\n4. Choices C and E are both correct. Choice C, \u201cI use a car more than 1 time-7 days in the week\u201d, expresses the same idea as the original phrase in the context of an environment.

{"text": "fly' is a grammatical error. \n5. Choice D, a definition of 'happiness', does not give good enough information on what causes sadness, which is what we are looking for in this context. \n6.

Choice E, which lists 'energetic', is incorrect in that 'energetic' does not refer to a specific emotion, such as sadness, but rather how someone behaves as a result of experiencing said emotions. \n8. From this, we can conclude that Option D is most likely the answer.\n9. In other words, \"If someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, they likely suffer from anxiety.\"\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: What are two things that people do while driving? Choices:  F: talk and eat  A: talk and text B: talk and drink  C: talk and sing  E: talk and eat and drink\nRationales: The questions asks people to list two things that drivers do \"while driving\". While a driver may talk and eat at the same time, this is not the intended answers here. There are two things people do that are not associated with driving. Therefore, they are out of the scope of the question.\n\nChoices:\n1. A: talk and text. This is an unacceptable answer because it includes talk, which is not the intended thing being done while driving.\n2. B: talk and drink.

It stands to reason that anxiety is unlikely to be the reason the individual would avoid performing. \n7. Choice 'D', 'happiness', is irrelevant. \n8. Choice 'E', 'energetic' could mean 'full of energy and enthusiasm', but it still wouldn't be necessary for 'having a talent but not loving to perform on stage'. \n9.

Option A, 'beautiful body,' isn't correct for this task because it describes physical appearance instead of health. 2. Option B, 'happy face,' isn't a correct option because well-being and health can't be solely based on what you feel. 3. Option C, a \"clean body,' implies a bodily state of purity.

TA's option 'tell her teacher' is wrong because a child should not necessarily tell her teacher about emergencies or family needs, unless the child is sure that her teacher will offer her time off or has an understanding of her family situation.\n2. Next, let's consider option TB 'be honest'. In this case, a child is being honest if she directly relates her issue to the teacher and uses her name when mentioning her family situation.\n3. Let's now consider option TC 'ask her teacher'. In this instance, a child 'asks her teachers' if she has permission to take time off, or if she knows that her teachers'may be sympathetic' because they have a family member with a disability that calls for intermittent absences.\n4. Next, is the option TD'saying she is going to miss a lot of school'? In this instance, a student is honest when the says she is going to miss, meaning that she is not hiding or sugar-coating her absence.\n5. Next, let' go to option TE If she has an emergeny'.

{"text": "flys', is grammatically incompatible with the option and, while describing a physical and mental block when performing (the 'butterflys' being nerves), it does not provide insight into where those mental blockages may stem from.\n5. Choiced C, 'anxiety', is often associated with a fear of performing in the first place, while this may not be the issue the person is having, it is a sufficient cause for someone not enjoying performing.\n6. Choices D & E, 'happiness' and 'energetic', are good options given the context, since performing can be seen as a source of negative emotions, but they do not adequately explain why enjoying performing might be a concern of the person in question. \n7. Therefore, if we compare the answers left, we can conclude that \"anxiety\" makes the most sense here.\nAnswer: C. Anxiety\n\nInput: What are some examples of plants? Choices: \n  A: trees\n  B: wheat\n  C: flowers\n  D: roses\n  E: grass\n  F: fruit\nRationales: The question is looking for an array of examples of plants, with \"some\" preceding the question itself. One way to make an educated response is to start narrowing out options and picking one of the 3 that remain. \n1. Choice A is \"trees\" \u2013 trees are not only plants but are a specific group of plants that would not be considered as a large cross-section of the type of plant referred to in the question. \n2. Choice B is \"wheat\" \u2013 same issue here. While wheat is most definitely a plant, it is not broad enough to fit the criteria given by the question.\n3. Choices C & D are \"flowers\" and \"roses\" \u2013 flowers & roses can be referred to as \"plants\" in that they belong to the class of organic beings with chlorophyll and thus some level of photosynthesis. But they are specific types of flower that would not adequately fit the term \"plant\" as the question was worded.\n4. Choices F. \"fruit\" is the logical answer given the preceding 2 options. While \"grass\" could theoretically be included in the list, given the general \"some\" wording of the question", "answer": " 5"}

We can then eliminate choice C, 'anxiety', option D, 'happiness', and option E, 'energetic'. \n6. Therefore, the only answer is B: talent persons cannot perform talent without suffering from anxiety.\nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot suffering from anxiety\n\nInput: Which of your favorite songs do you listen to the greatest? Choices:  Song from the Wings of Fire series  song two times the song three times the song I have sung all of my songs so many times I can't pick a favorite\nRationales: The question indicates that you have several different types of songs that you love to listen to, and now you are asking which one(s) you play the most. \n1. There is no specific song mentioned. \n2. Choice A, Song from the Wings series, doesn't really make sense: it's an entire series, and none of the songs are listed. \n3. We can eliminate choice B, \"song two times,\" and choose A. \n4. Since we're not playing our favorite song, but the one we listen to the most. \n5. By removing A, song from the Wings of a Song series, this leaves us with C as our only choice, as the only other choice is to play \n6. \"I have sung all my songs so many times.\" Since you can't play and favorite song, we'll answer song C.\nAnswer: C.

{"text": "fly' is a statement of a logical impossibility, not an expression of fact. \n5. Choice D, being 'happy' is not necessarily a sign of anxiety if you're not enjoying performing. \n6.

Looking at the remaining choices, we know that Choice E, 'anxiety' is an option related to the context of the question. \n8.

Choice B, \"anxiety,\" does not answer the question as one would not typically expect someone with anxiety to be able to perform.\n6.

The list of choices includes both reasons why an elephant might go to a doctor, as well as reasons the elephant might not. 3 Choice D \"because it was sick\" does not explain why or when the elephant decided to visit a doctor.\n4 Choice E \"because it was upset by seeing the mouse in distress\" makes sense, since perhaps the elephant decided it should visit the doctor when it saw distress.\n5 Choice F \"the mouse was in distress\" provides an explanation for why the elephant would visit a doctor at the moment.\n\n\nChoice G \"the mouse was upset by seeing an elephant\", however, does not make sense as the mouse was not seeing an elephant, as the elephant was seeing the mouse. The elephant also would have been observing the effects of the mouse's distress rather than the mouse itself. \n\n6 Both G and F describe a scenario in which the elephant sees the mouse in distress and has some emotional response. \"Because it was sick\" is a logical answer, and would be expected to describe", "answer": " 2000"}
{"text": "fly', is grammatically incorrect, so it can be eliminated.\n5. Choices C and D both relate to psychological afflictions, but in each case, they could arise from performing.\n6.

Choices: A: shopping B: studying C: babysitting D: traveling E: practicing\nRationales: First, let's identify the details of the question. It asks for what the girl (a girl's parents had thought she was at the the mall but she was actually doing, as indicated by the title of this task).\nLooking at the choices, the options that make the least sense in that particular context are: A: shopping and B: studying. Both shopping and studying involve spending time at a mall so the girl's parents would not have mistaken either of those activities.\nC:babysitting doesn't make any sense at all. Babysitting is a child-care service not a type of activity that one would be doing at the mall.\nD:Traveling makes no sense either because one cannot usually travel to the mall. In reality, however, the girl was traveling. This is due to the fact that she was part of a group performing at a local festival.\nE:Practicing describes the girl learning some dance moves prior to the performance. Practicing is actually one of the actions that the girl's parents might have initially mistaken for being at the mall. This means we can eliminate choice E. \nTherefore, our answer is D: traveling.\nAnswer: D-Traveling\n\nInput: What does the prefix \u2018pro\u2019 mean in Proceed?

The prefix \u2018pro\u2019 means \u2018forward\u2019 or \u2018in advance\u2019, while \u2018process\u2019 is a noun that describes a particular stage of an action. In other", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "fly syndromes', doesn't make sense either.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety', and E, 'energic', might seem related to a person suffering from butterflies during performing, but the specific phrasing implies that their reluctance is more generalized than a nervous response to fear. \n6. This implies that this individual experiences anxiety or depression surrounding the potential for performing. \n7. Choice B, D, and E are also unlikely because butterflies relate to positive feelings, not negative ones. \n8. Ultimately, the best answer is going to be either D or E, depending on how 'butterflies' are perceived to evoke positive or negative feelings surrounding performance. \n9. However, given that 'talent' and 'performance' are inherently linked in this instance, we know that the person does not want to display or utilize said talent. \n10. Furthermore, it is likely that the talent being described is an artistic one, like singing or acting. \n11. Given all this, the best answer choice is likely E: energetic, as although these feelings represent a positive emotion, 'butterflies, often suggest a sense of anxiety that a person does not want to experience.\nAnswer: E.energetic", "answer": " 322"}
{"text": "fly's', isn't valid as while butterflies is a proper noun and thus not a typo error, it doesn't make sense because being talented and enjoying performing are not opposed to one another.\n5. Consideration Choice C, anxiety, is related to being nervous or afraid, which could explain why someone with this talent would not be able to showcase it without it taking a negative toll.\n6. Consideration choice D, 'happiness', could be a valid answer if it is assumed that being happy leads to one enjoying performing, but since we already determined that they don't enjoy performing, it is assumed that happiness wouldn't make the talent suffer.\n7. Consideration choice E, 'energetic', isn't related to this question. \n8. Therefore, as we have eliminated all the incorrect choices, it is reasonable that if someone is talent but doesn\u2019t like performing, they likely suffer from anxiety.\nAnswer: B: talent persons cannot suffering from injury and butterly's", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense as 'and butterfly' suggests injury is associated with butterfly wings and talent is separate to injury. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not relate to performing, so it is not an option. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is correct as anxiety is typically related to a situation that could bring harm; a situation that has the potential to do harm may be performing. \n7. Choice B, however, does imply a talent, which is not mentioned as a factor in the question. However, since the question does not discuss injury, we can eliminate the choice B, 'talent can't suffer from injury'. \n8. Therefore, answer C, anxiety, fits the best.\nAnswer: C. anxiety\n\nInput: I want to make sure I have the correct information about this person's job, how can I ensure this? Choices:  S: read a website  T: look at their ID picture  R: look at their resume  F: ask them for their official identification  J: ask them to show their ID\nRationales:  1. The question is related to establishing facts or information about an individual, the person for whom we want info.\n2. The question tells us what specific information we want to confirm.\n3. The choices given suggest methods to confirm that information. We can identify three choices that make the most sense and two that do not. \n4. First, choose the option that does not make sense. Choice J, 'Ask them to show their id', is uncharacteristically specific for the context, as the question never explicitly states we want the person's ID. It also suggests unnecessary risk \u2013 we have no way of knowing if the person's ID is honest or even real. \n5. Second, choose the best answer choice. Of the remaining two candidates, the most relevant would be R, 'Look at their resume.'\n6. Third, eliminate as a possibility. As the question asked about the person's job, the resume is a list with their work, including titles they held and related information. \n7. Therefore, it is important to rule out two choices to find the correct answer \u2013 R, 'look at their resume'.\nAnswer: R, look at their resume", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "lies', isn't relevant, as it describes what talent persons cannot suffer from, rather than what a talent person actually suffers from. \n5.

Hence, the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C anxiety\n\nInput: What's a problem some people have that will cause them to feel like they are not getting a fair shake? Choices:  B: no one feels like they are getting a fair shake C: too much work D: unfair job E: not getting enough money\nRationales:  1. The question asks about a problem some people may have that will cause them stress.\n2. We can eliminate irrelevant choices.\n3. Choices B, D and E are either irrelevant to this topic (\"No one feels like they are not getting fair shake, that is too much work, or not getting enough money\") or contain too much information (\"Not getting a fair shake is a problem some people have and that will cause them to feels stress\").\n4. It can be difficult to tell if someone at work is getting a fair shake. For some people, it could mean more work and being too stressed. For others, just having too much work might not feel fair. But we can also eliminate Choice C, \"Too much work\" from our list of possibilities based on 3) above, leaving us just two options left: Choices A and D.\n5. Choices A and D are more related to the concept of fairness in comparison to choice B (\"no one feels like they are having a fair shake\") because that phrase suggests that people are not getting a fair experience, not just feeling fair to each other.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is that \"no one feels like they have a fair shake.\"\nAnswer: A: no one feels like you have a fair shake\n\nInput: What about the crop that grows from 9 inches tall to 36 inches tall?

Choices:  (The answer is very probable) A: bad B: good C: low D: high E: very probable\n\nRationales: The choice \"good\" means that chances for the car to start are high.

In contrast to this, 'anxiety' and 'energetic' both relate to one's mental state, which fits the context of the question well. \n7. As 'energetic' does not apply to a lack of performance talent, this narrows down the options to 'anxiety'.\n8.

The key words here are \"make\" errors and \"didn't\". These indicate that it's not about past mistakes, but potential ones that have not yet occurred. \n2. Choices A and E do not make sense because only these contain the phrase \"but never\". This phrase does not make any sense as a response to a question regarding \"not making any mistakes\".\n3. The second phrase is: \"Any of them do not.\" This shows that the focus is on whether or not any errors were made but still hasn't defined what actions are being discussed. \n4.

{"text": "fly', is not specific enough as it does not elaborate on what is being described (e.g. 'butterfly' refers to various things, such as nervousness, love, or creativity, thus removing it as a viable option). \n5.

While happiness could be considered a positive motivating factor, there are many other factors that could influence their feelings about performing. \n6. Choice B, anxiety, on the other hand, is a negative emotion, but it can also be associated with performing - for example, a person may have social anxiety which may dissuade them from performing in front of others. It also suggests they may fear not being able to perform up to their expectations or having a traumatic experience, such as failing or being rejected.\n7.

Considering what we already know about the answer, it could be either something food related or something drink related, that you can order while dining. \n10. Option A, 'food' is a broad term and a general description of an order, without being helpful in discerning what specifically is being referred to.\n11. Considering option B, 'tea', it is a specific type of drink you can order, but it makes no sense for what we are considering.\n12.

Choices: A. buy/sell B. work C. give D. invest E. ask\nRationales: The question is asking what options are available for students to make money. Choice A is not the only option, because there are multiple ways for students to make money: A: Buy/Sell\nThis might be an option for students who are selling items online, such as through a classifieds website or an auction house, but this is not the only option. \nChoice B, 'work', refers to gaining employment, which is another potential means of making money for students, but it is not the only means either. \nChoice C: 'Give', does not necessarily refer to giving money.\nChoice D, 'Invest', is another valid option and is also not the only option.\nChoice E: 'Ask', is also another valid way for students to make money, but it is also not the only means possible.\nHence, the answer is E, Ask.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe above is an instruction that describes how to complete the task.

{"text": "flys', doesn't make sense because it mentions two distinct issues when the question only asks about suffering from one. \n5. Choice D, '\"'happiness doesn't make sense\"', as the question already asks about suffering. Also, \"happiness\" is not a mental illness. \n6. Choice C, \"Anxiety\", may fit as it is a mental health issue commonly associated with fear, stress, or discomfort in social situations. Anxiety can cause physical symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, trembling, and difficulty focusing or concentrating on the task at hand. Anxiety also can cause emotional symptoms such as feelings of dread, uneasiness, and restlessness.\n7. Choices E, 'energetic', does not seem related to talent because it describes someone with a lot of energy.\n8. Therefore the best answer is choice C, \"Anxity\", as it is a mental illness that causes emotional symptoms when performing a task. This could reasonably explain why a person with a talent but does not enjoy performing would suffer from performance anxiety.\n9. Therefore the best answer choice is \"C\".\nAnswer: C: Anxiety\n\nInput: How many letters in the word 'birthday' without any letter repeating or appearing twice? It has two o's, so there are 25 letters, but one or the other repeats, so that only leaves 24 letters to choose.\nThere 24 letters in the word birthday, as it is not the case that either 'o' repeats or appears twice. This is because 'o' appears only once, being preceded by 'i' and followed by 'y'. 'S' appears twice, one before and one after 'e'. 'T' appears twice, one after 'r', and the other after 'y'.\nRationales: The question is asking the number of letters in the word birthdy without repeating or appearing twice.\n\n### Input: A person is trying to answer this question, \"What do you call the long thin piece of land that extends into the sea from a country?\" The best answer choice is land, because 'land' is part of the question.

{"text": "fly', is obviously incorrect as it doesn't make sense to say that people with a talent cannot suffer from injury, suggesting that not every person with talent is capable of acting.\n5. Choices C and D do not fit in this context either because anxiety and happiness are unlikely to be a barrier for someone who likes performing.\n6. Hence, it's likely that this question is asking for a negative response that would indicate that the person in question is reluctant to perform.\n7. And since we know that performing is related to some kind of talent, it is unlikely that this individual has no talent, so Choice E, 'energetic', is likely not correct here, and the best answer is Choice B, 'anxiety'.\nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: One common characteristic to consider when evaluating a good candidate for leader of a team is which of the following? Choices:  a) trustworthiness b) honesty c) leadership skills d) experience e) open-mindedness\nRationales: The question asks for what quality is to be considered when evaluating a good potential leader candidate for a team. 1. Choice a, 'trustworthiness', is not directly related to leadership and can be considered indirectly. 2. Choice b, 'honesty', is not a single thing but a trait of a leader. 3. Choice c, 'leadership skills', is not a single trait of a leader but a general characteristic of potential leadership. 4. Choices d and e, 'experience' and 'open-mindedness', respectively, are not considered characteristics of leaders, but of candidates. Therefore, Choice a, is not the only choice available, and Choice b, 'leadership-ability', will be considered as a correct answer. 5. Considering the available choices, it is clear that Choice d, 'leadership', is not a single characteristic or trait of any leader or candidate and is thus not a valid choice. 6. Finally, Choice e, 'innovative-mindedness', does not relate to leadership as it is something one does rather than being a trait they posses. 7. Therefore, the remaining options would have to be further evaluated. 8. It is not likely that Choice d, can be excluded as a choice. If Choice d", "answer": " 24"}

Thus, the option we are looking for is that pertaining to feelings or emotions. \n8. By eliminating the false options, we are left with choosing between Choice A, 'anxiety, and Choice C, \"anxious', which are both feeling related. \n9. It makes more sense to consider what the person is avoiding, rather than what they are avoiding. \n10. 'Anxiety' is typically associated with a feeling of uneasiness, while 'anxious' implies having a fear towards something, a worry. \n11. Therefore, we can conclude the best option is Choice C, 'anxious'.\nAnswer: C: anxious", "answer": " 90"}

Finally, Choice D, 'happiness,' is not specific as to a talent person suffering from it or not. It could mean a person who enjoys performing or a person who has a talent but feels no joy in their performance, leaving a lot of room for interpretation.\n7.

Choices: \tA: skilled B: knowledgeable C: experienced D: expert E: none of these\nRationales:1. The word in this question that can be confusing is the word level because the question appears to imply the subject must have confidence at as high a level as possible.\n2. The question isn't asking which skills or knowledge you should develop to improve your confidence. Instead, the person who is given the confidence can be highly skilled or knowledgeable (or any combination of the two).\n3. Another possible issue that needs to be addressed is the choice of level. The question seems to imply that a person needs a high level of confidence, suggesting that the subject wants to be very sure about the results.\n4.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect because butterflies are more than just physical butterflies, but also figurative ones. For example, someone might have what we refer to as 'butterflies in their stomach', which is an irrational fear about an impending performance.\n5. Choices A and B are not correct choices because they are not related to an objection against performing.\n6. Looking at the remaining choices, Choice C, 'anxiety', is a psychological feeling that can potentially hinder performance. For example, if a person performs well in school because of anxiety toward failure, this could hinder a performing career. \n7. Choice B, however, is incorrect because it describes anxiety as a mental objection. In the given scenario, the objection is likely emotional rather than mental.\n8.

{"text": "fly's,' could be an answer, but it's impractical; no one would describe themselves as \"talent persons\" to a stranger. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness,\" doesn't work because people with talent can enjoy performing; they simply don't have to in order to succeed at their art.\n6. Choices C and E are also not correct; Choice C, \"anxiety,\" isn't necessary for anyone with talent, because no one lacks talent solely because they are nervous, and Choice E, \"energetic\", doesn't work because it's not a negative, debilitating emotion.\n7. Therefore it's reasonable to choose Choice B: talent persons suffer from 'talent persons cannot', which is a play on words that means 'talented people cannot suffer from talent'; it states that anyone with talent is not able to suffer from talent because they live with the belief they are able to develop, and even succeed, in their talents.\nAnswer: B: talent persons suffer\n\nInput: What subject would you go into if you wanted to work in the government? Choices:  C:\\Fed: A: English B: Chemistry C: Mathematics D: Politics E: Physics\nRationales: The question is asking what subject you'd need to go into if you wanted a job in the government. In other words, it asks you to describe the main field of study needed to enter civil service work. The key word is \"government\" \u2013 we need to choose the subject area of study that'll help to enter governmental employment. The subject \"English\" is definitely not related to the job in government; perhaps you'd be asked to help with language education, but that's out of scope. \nChemistry relates to chemistry, but not to political positions and civil service. \nMathematics may be related to finances, but not to politics. \nPolitics is in scope as a possible choice, but \"Politics\" itself is too broad. \nWe may be able to consider \"physical\" or \"physic\", but physic can refer to physics and science itself, which are too vague here.

{"text": "flys' isn't the sort of response expected from the question. Butterflies do not describe emotional states, such as anxiety. And what the choice describes is, in fact, quite the opposite of a psychological condition like anxiety or depression. \n5. Choice D, \"happiness\" cannot fit as happiness is a condition, not a talent. And if we want to describe conditions or experiences, it makes more sense to use the word 'emotions'. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\" aligns with what the question is implying - this choice is about a psychological state that would prevent someone from performing.\n7. Although Choice E, \"energetic\" may be related to a performance art, it is not a characteristic that would prevent a person from performing. \n8.

The question is about a fictional scenario where a car has stopped in the middle of a road.\n2. Looking at Choices A, B, C, D, and E, we note that only Choice E, \"it would become more efficient\" does not match any other choice.\n3. This is because A and B describe events that would stop the car, D describes one that would not, and C and D describe one that would have the opposite of the desired effect.\n4. Since the option that doesn't match any other answer is the only option with no flaws, this is the most likely answer. \n5.

{"text": "fly', is incorrect because talents relate to specific subjects and this phrase describes a symptom, such as butterflies before a big performance. \n5. Choice B, happiness is a feeling, not an issue that restricts a person's talent, which is why it does not describe a person who is talent but does not like performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is also a feeling, rather than a symptom that prevents one's talent. \n7. Choice E, energetic describes someone who enjoys performing art and so does not relate to a person who does not like performing but is talent.\n8.

A: yes 2. B: no 3. C: It depends 4. D: no way 5. E: why not\nRationales:\n1. The question is posing a question (Can kids really learn well at home?) in order to test the logical conclusion of each given answer. \n2. To conclude whether a choice makes sense, we must apply it to the question and observe if the answer makes sense. \n3. For example, Option A says Yes. This suggests the question would be: \"Can kids really learn at home if they're at home?\"\n4. So is the answer, Yes, suitable? If one is at home, one isn't away from home. This is not a time when they're \"home\" and \"away from home.\" In this case, Yes wouldn't make sense.\n5. Option D doesn't make sense. This is why they're asking the question in the first place.\n6. Options B, C and E can all be eliminated because they don't directly respond to the question. \n7.

Choices: 2 A: 2 times B: 3 times C: not divisible D: 4 times E: 5 times\nRationales: The question is asking how many times a given number is divisible by 2. A divisor (2) is an addition to the number (2). \nIn this case, there are two addends. We need to find how many times the original number (two) is divisible by the divisors (two) to get the correct answer.\n\n1) Eliminate answer choice 'D'.\n2) The answer choices that work must be factors (multiple ways to subtract the original number from the number). \n3) 2 is a factor of 4, but not of 4.6 because of the decimals in 4.6.

Choice C, \"anxiety\", does not directly address 'performing', nor is it inherently related to talent. \n7. Looking at C D again, we can see that \"anxiety\" is related to performance (anxiety may come from having to perform) but not talent (not all talented people suffer from anxiety). \n8. So, that leaves us with Choice D, 'happiness'. It fits the question the best as it's a psychological issue which directly relates to performance, making it the best choice. \n9.

{"text": "fly', isn't appropriate because while talent persons may not suffer from physical injury, they can suffer from psychological conditions.\n5. Choices C, 'anxiety' and D, 'happiness', aren't relevant because although it might be the case that someone who is a talent and doesn't like performing suffers from anxiety or happiness, this isn't the primary issue at hand. \n6. Choice B, happiness, implies that someone who is a happiness doesn't like performing. This is clearly not possible. \n7. In sum, we can eliminate choices C-D. \n8. Choice E, happiness, could mean they are suffering from having the energy and motivation to do what they like for themselves. However, performing is not something exclusively for one's own fulfillment, but this could imply the performing isn't fulfilling their goals. \n9. Choice E, performance anxiety, is the one remaining choice. Although it isn't directly stated in the question that they aren't a happy person, it is implied by what is said. \n10. In summary of all of the above, choice E \"performance anxiety\" seems to make sense from the information provided.\nAnswer: E. performance anxiety\n\nInput: After the rain stopped, our neighbor decided to clean up her backyard.

The question is telling you that after the rain stopped, our neighbors decided to clean up her yard. She is trying to complete the job as quickly as possible, so the answer will probably imply that she started the job right away. \n12. Consider the choices given, only ones starting with A might make sense because our neighborhood is our neighbor's house or backyard. On the other hand, choices starting with B, C or D are not related to the backyard. Chosing Choice A, we can see that we have to check the answer that is the correct answer and the correct explanation for the correct answer", "answer": " 160"}
{"text": "fly', doesn't make sense because 'butterfly' is incorrect grammar. The correct choice here is 'anxieties'.\n5. Choice D, \"happiness\", doesn't fit as it cannot make sense to suffer from happiness; it is contradictory to a talent person. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", fits best as it describes the negative emotional responses that someone might have.\n7. Choices E: \"energy\" and \"energetic\" aren't the kind of emotion or feeling that we're looking for. Energy is a physical manifestation of power or movement and energetic is a state or quality of being energetic. Our emotions are also not energetic nor are they a state; therefore, we can eliminate these choices. \n8. Therefore, as the most accurate option in this case, the answer is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C anxiety\n\nInput: Where else could a snake potentially go besides a snake house? Choices:  B: the zoo C: the ocean D: the mountains E: anywhere it wants\nRationales: Understanding what the question is asking is the first step when determining the correct answer. In this case, the question is asking where else a snake could go that is not a specific type of building called a snake house.  Considering the given statement that snake houses is a type of building, we know that we are looking for a place to go that cannot be a snake house. The options we will use to decipher what could be considered a snake house are C, D, and E.  We can then go on to determine what could be considered a house and look for answers that indicate an inability to be one.  The first option that could be considered a house is C, The zoo. The zoo is a building that houses multiple different animals, but it doesn\u2019t house just snakes, so we can eliminate this option. Choice D, the mountains, could be considered a house because it is a place to stay. However, it can be considered a house or a building.  It can be built to be a house or a place to stay, but it is more typically considered a place to stay. It is not considered a house because it cannot be a house because it is the type of place one doesn\u2019t have to rent. It is also not", "answer": " 65"}
{"text": "fly's', while interesting, doesn't actually make sense in relation to this question. \n5. Choice D, happiness, and Choice E, 'energetic', don't quite seem to fit either, as the person seems concerned about the emotional aspect of performing, rather than any sort of external energy. \n6. Therefore, we can choose choice C: anxiety, as it seems to best fit the context of this question. Note that the term \"suffer from\", while used in the official prompt, doesn't actually appear in the question. \n7. Therefore, we can logically also consider choice B, but for the sake of elimination process. \n8. Thus, choosing B is to confirm that the person doesn't suffer from talent persons cannot suffer from anxiety. \n9. Therefore, both Choice A: injury and Choice B: talent person cannot suffer from anxiety do not fit the question as they are irrelevant. \n10.

{"text": "fly', is irrelevant as it is a misplaced comma. \n5. Choice D, happiness, is often associated with a feeling of elation and confidence which is at odds with the question's context of performance anxiety.\n6. Choices C and E are both psychological disorders that could explain a hesitancy toward a particular skill, but 'anxiety' makes more sense in the context of performing. \n7. Therefore, we can determine that the best answer is Choice C: anxiety.\n8. Option A, injury, is removed from our answer choices because we know it doesn't fit the criteria.\n9.

Choices: \nA: heart attack B: stroke C: alcohol abuse D: dehydration E: fatigue\nRationales: The question is asking what would happen if someone had more than just a few too many drinks. \nLooking at the choices, we have several choices that seem viable. \nWe can eliminate choices C and D because while both heart attack and stroke can occur as a result of alcohol abuse, drinking more alcohol does not directly cause either of these. \nInstead, heart attack and stroke occur as a result of long term, chronic alcohol abuse.\nLikewise, Choice E is also eliminated because alcohol consumption can lead to dehydration but drinking too much alcohol does not strictly cause this. \nAll three are secondary effects of drinking alcohol, not the cause. \nHowever, Choices A and B are valid answers because a stroke can occur as a direct result of a heart attack and a heart attack can occur as a result drinking too many drinks.\nWith the answer options down to two viable answers, we can consider eliminating the less specific answer, Choice B, stroke, because it is a more general term. \nWe can then consider Choice A: heart attack because it mentions a more specific event (heart attack) than Choice D: stroke. \nTherefore, Choice A: A: heart attack", "answer": " 7425"}

So, we are left with Choices C, anxiety, and E, energetic.\n7. While both of these answers are correct, Choice E (energetic) is a little bit too broad as it applies to lots of things, including sports, careers, and life in general. \n8. Choice C (anxiety) is more specific to performing, which is what is mentioned in the question statement.\n9.

Choice D, happiness, also doesn't fit because although happiness is a common trait among talented individuals, it's not what the given statement proposes.\n6. Thus, the only choices remaining are Choice B and Choice E: anxiety and butterflies. \n7. There is overlap between the two descriptions, both implying nerves or nervousness, and some stage fright, which suggests one is more suitable than the other. \n8. Out of these options, 'anxiety' is the most suitable. \n9.

Choices C, B, E, A, and D are all options that refer to body heat, and all of them can help keep an animal warm.\n3. Choices A and C are both animals with fur but the latter implies an underclassman's coat, an older form of clothes.\n4. Choices B is a type of artificial insulation.\n5.

{"text": "fly', is also incorrect as it indicates a contradiction within the reasoning rather than a potential cause for the sufferer's issue. \n5. Looking at Choices C, 'anxiety', and Choice E, 'energetic', we can quickly infer that these are not incorrect, but also that a lack of enjoyment alone doesn't cause any physical harm, let alone injury or death; \n6. Therefore, we turn our attention to Choice D, 'anxiety'. \n7. We know that people can experience anxiety for many reasons. It doesn't only indicate a fear of something physical, such as injury. Anxiety can have mental origins as well, indicating a hesitation from certain stressful situations. \n8. We know people experience anxiety and also do not necessarily enjoy performing in front of an audience, indicating anxiety could be the cause of this person's issue. 9. Therefore, the best option to choose is Choice D, 'Anxiety'.\nAnswer: D: anxiety\n\nInput: Where would a person go to find an electronic device to buy Choices:  A phone store B computer store C: the internet D: mall E: radio shack\nRationales: This question is about where someone would go to find a place to purchase an electronic device. \n1. Looking at options A and B these are locations to purchase phones and computers but don't specifically indicate electronics in general. \n2. Moving to option C, \"the internet,\" it mentions electronics but there are many other possibilities for electronics that the internet does not specifically address. \n3. We are looking at places where one could buy electronics but we don't need to focus on this narrowly. \n4. Moving to option D, \"the mall,\" it mentions electronics in general. It would also be possible to find other things besides phones and computers if needed. \n5. Our focus remains on where electronics can be found and the option \"the mall\" fits this well since it has both electronic and other items. \n6. E, \"radio shack\" mentions electronics in general, but it is not a location where one could go find these items. Instead, it would have to be obtained from elsewhere. \n7.

{"text": "flyes', is incorrect as 'talent persons' are an irrelevant group mentioned in the question.\n5. Choices E, 'energetic', and C, 'anxiety', are phrased in a way that implies that someone who has these emotions is necessarily an energetic person. This does not necessarily match the given context where it states that the person cannot like performing, implying a lack of excitement or enthusiasm, rather than an inappropriate amount of energy.\n6. Choices B and C are also too broad as 'personalities who don't like performing' can either be anxious or extremely energetic.\n7. Therefore by comparing the remaining choices, most likely, an answer with a word like 'anxiety' or 'happiness' would make the most sense.\n8. The most logical answer is C, 'happiness' as 'talent persons', according to the question, cannot suffer from either happiness or anxiety, implying that someone who loves and enjoys performing is likely to be happy.\nAnswer: C & D: happiness & anxiety\n\nInput: Someone needs to find the most effective way to _______ a problem. Choices: A: ignore; B: forget; C: solve; D: overcome\nRationales: The question asks the person to find the most effective 'way to _______ a ________. '\n1. As the first person is missing in the sentence, a possible solution for this is to replace it with 'ignore'. As there is only one blank in the sentence, this is the reasonable answer.\n2. Now, let's look at each option that goes with the blank. If each missing word was given, we'd find that we could eliminate some options.\n3. For \"solve\", the blank left is a verb, something the word \"solve\" is. While \"forget\" would go with the blank \"problem,\" it doesn't fit because 'forget' the problem isn't the most effective to 'overcome' the problem.\n4. If the word \"problem\" were given, \"overcome\" would make it a very fitting solution, but as that word is missing, \"overcome\" is not a logical choice.\n5. As \"ignore\" is the only choice with a missing word that fits the sentence perfectly, it makes sense.\nAnswer: A", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "flys', refers to butterflies as a metaphor for jittery stomachs, which are not a physical issue. \n5. Choice D, happiness, doesn't quite make sense because while it is associated with feelings that are desirable, it is also an outcome, not a cause. \n6. Therefore, we can narrow our options further to be just Choices C and E. \n7. Choice C, anxiety, makes sense. It is a common experience among performers who may feel unsure, anxious, or nervous to some degree, which could manifest in a variety of ways. \n8. Choice E, energy is ruled out because if the performer is highly energized, this could make them less hesitant, or worried, about performance while being talent. \n9. Therefore, since Choice C, anxiousness, makes a lot of sense in the situation, it's the best choice. \nAnswer: B: anxiety\n\nInput: When someone sees an elephant or tiger, the most obvious reaction is to scream? Choices:  C: nope D: yes E: scream F: run\nRationales:1. The question asks about the most common reaction to seeing an animal like an elephant or a tiger.\n2. Choice C, which only says \"No\", isn't much of an choice because it can be misleading that the answer is no, because there are multiple other options as well.\n3. Choices D, E and F are all valid options to the question, the one that makes the best sense would be Choice F, which is \"Run\".\nAnswer: F: run\n\nInput: Which of the following states contains the most national parks?

It is possible they are conflicted and therefore not happy while performing. \n6. Choice C, \"anxiety\", is a valid option.

Choices: A: the most hated man in America - Thomas Edison B: one of the most famous - Thomas Edison C: the man in history - Thomas Edison D: the one who invented the lightbulb E: the one who invents the lightbulb\nRationales: The question is asking about a famous American inventor, and about what that person is called.\n\n8. Considering choice A, \"the most hated man in American\": This answer is too negative and doesn't match the style of the question. In addition, it doesn't mention the person's fame because it only refers to a negative characteristic. \n9. Considering choice B, \"most famous in history\": This answer is too vague and not specific enough to be correct. It doesn't refer to a name or anything more specific. \n10.

{"text": "fly', implies that talent persons aren't able to overcome certain physical or mental challenges, which is quite an extreme statement.\n5. Choices C and D mention emotions, like anxiety and happiness, which is also excluding possibilities too. \n6. If we look at some of the things that affect the ability to perform, we might think of mental obstacles like anxiety, or physical barriers like injury or illness. But we can also exclude those because they are not what the person wants to avoid performing. \n7. As someone who has a talent but suffers from anxiety while performing may be too fearful to perform or may not be inclined to perform at all. Therefore, it is excluded.\n8. So, the remaining options are C, 'anxiety', and D, 'happiness'.\n9. If we ask ourselves the question 'why does this person not perform?' we can understand how they are not happy performing. But on the other hand, if they don't enjoy performing, it's unlikely they experience extreme anxiety about it either. \n10. So we can eliminate choice D: happiness and therefore remain with C: anxiety.\n11.

Anxiety\n\nInput: If there is a 20% chance that it would rain and a 40% chance that there would cloud cover then the odds that it would actually rain were? Choices:  C: 53% E: 20% A: 66% B: 42% D: 35%\nRationales:1. This question involves calculating probabilities based on given information.\n2. This process involves a simple logic, in which you multiply the probability of each scenario and the total is your odds of a certain event occurring.\n3. For this particular problem, we are trying to find how likely it is for it to rain if there is a 2/5 chance of it raining with a 4/5 chance that there will be cloud cover. Thus, we can use the following formula: 0.2 x 0.4 = 0.08.\n4. To complete the problem, the next step is to multiply those odds of \"0.08\" by 100 and we would get our result of 8%.\n5. Therefore, A: 66%, E: 20%, are incorrect options.\n6. Choices C and B do not use the given information. Thus, they are ruled out.\n7. Therefore: the only correct answer is A: 66%.\nAnswer: 66%\n\nInput: I am going to buy something from this store, where is the first place I should look?

Choice E 'energetic', doesn't make sense as a specific response to an unwillingness to perform, as it is more the result of high energy levels. \n6. Choice D, happiness, makes sense as happy people are more willing to do things that please them.\n7. Choices B, C and D can be eliminated since only one of them is related to psychological challenges. \n8. Therefore, we conclude that our answer is Choice E: anxiety.\nAnswer: E, Anxiety", "answer": " 375"}
{"text": "lies', might feel right given that it says'cannot ', which implies they don't normally suffer from it. But this is not necessarily true. \n5. Choice D, happiness, can sometimes lead to anxiety, and there's nothing in the context to suggest that the person in question is suffering from happiness. \n6. With these eliminations, Choice C, 'anxiety' remains as a possible answer. But can we confirm this is a correct answer? \n7. A good way to confirm that our answer is correct is to review a possible correct answer in contrast with incorrect answers. \n8. Looking at Correct Answer C, 'anxiously', this might seem like the same as C, 'anxiet'. However, the key difference is the adverb \"anxiously\". The word 'anxiously' explains how the performer's anxiety is expressed, and that their anxiety is linked to performing.\n9. By considering the remaining incorrect answers given, we can confirm that C, 'anxious', is correct as it is the only one that is linked to performing and explained how the anxiety is expressed.\n10. In conclusion, because we are looking for a performer with anxiety in relation to performing, Choice C, the word 'anxiety', is the most correct and reasonable choice, given the context of the question. \nAnswer: C: anxiety\n\nInput: After an accident, sometimes we forget to act in defense of our __________, which is a legal duty. Choices:  A. lives B. well being C. property D. children E. personal finances\nRationales: Let's look at all of the options:  A. lives - this is not related to legal responsibility or an accident. \nB. well being - well being can be defined as an individual\u2019s state as a whole, not just their physical state, as in their legal state. \nC. property - the property in question is not the person suffering in an accident, but their legal rights, such as property damage. \nD. children - this is not an item of legal responsibility, which makes this choice irrelevant. \nE. personal finances - the most relevant aspect of this is financial protection, which is a legal duty, even after an accident. \n\nThus, the best option remains E: personal finances\n\nInput:", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "fly', is not a plausible answer since butterflies are insects that typically do not experience injury or anxiety. \n5. Choice D, '\"happy\", does not align with the question as such. \n6.

I didn't want to miss this meeting so I took the subway, it saved me time from driving and parking. I did take the bus to work though earlier in the day. Why? Choices:  I: wanted to look professional for the meeting. II: want my coworkers to save money. III: to be ready for my meeting. IV: need to be prepared to do my presentation.\nRationales:\n1. The question is looking for why the individual took the subway to their meeting from work but took the bus to their workplace earlier in the day.\n2. Consider the available choices. \n3. There is only one choice that aligns with this question. \n4. The choice that doesn't fit is choice I: \"to look professional for meeting\". \n5. This doesn't make sense because the individual mentioned they were attending an important meeting and they want to show they prepared ahead of time - not that they are attending to look like they prepared ahead of time. \n6. Furthermore, there is no direct reference to clothing or attire in the question. \n7. Choice II: \"to save my coworkers' money\" does not seem related to commuting choices, given the context of it being a professional meeting. \n8. Similarly, Choice III: \"to be ready for my meeting\" and Choice IV: \"need to be prepared for my meeting\" both fail the contextual match. \n9. The only possible answer that aligns contextually is Choice IV: \"to be prepared for my presentation\". \n10.

{"text": "fly' doesn't make sense at all as the clause in the blank makes no sense. \n5.

Choice B, \"talent persons cannot suffer injury and butterfies\" does not make sense in the context of performing, nor is the phrase \"talented persons\" acceptable syntax to begin with. \n7. Choice C, \"anxiety\", does make sense in the context provided. In fact, being able to perform well in front of others can make some people feel anxious or insecure, which might cause them to hesitate to perform.

Choices:  a. order food b. get food from the kitchen c. pay the bill d. pick an item from the menu e. choose something from the food menu\nRationales: This question requires identifying one of the five choices to describe the process of choosing an option in a restaurant.\n\n1. It's first important to identify that the restaurant is the context for the question, as'restaurant' is part of the question and does not already appear in the answer choices.\n2. Considering choice a, 'order food', one can order food in a restaurant or a fast food restaurant (i.e. McDonald's), but not all restaurants serve actual food. For example, a buffet does not serve food but offers food-type items. Hence, this option doesn't make sense because the question is referring to a traditional sit-down restaurant.\n3. Choices b, c, d, and e all sound like logical processes as a person eats at a restaurant (e.g. pays the bill, picks an item from the food menu, etc.).\n4. Thus, choice a is redundant, as ordering food is the same as eating food and cannot be completed before the person actually eats at the restaurant (which is also when they pay the bill).\n5. This means that the answer to this question is d, pick an item from the food.\nAnswer: D : Pick an item from the food\n\nInput:", "answer": " 480"}
{"text": "fliess', is not an answer to the question. It is instead speculating on specific scenarios and rules of performance art, such as musicians not suffering injury. \n5. Choice D, happiness, does not fit as this person has something holding them back from performing. \n6. Choice C, anxiety, is an acceptable choice, as anxiety can prevent someone from performing due to apprehension.\n7. In conclusion, the correct answer choice is C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C.\n\nInput: If you were in high school, what would you remember the most about your grade school teachers? Choices: 1. A: how young they looked\n2. B: what they would wear\n3. C: what they were like once school got out\n4. D: what they did before they were teachers\n5. E: who their family members were\nRationales: The question is asking which parts of a high school teacher's life are most salient to recall. As such, we are interested in how old they look, what they wear, how they are like once school is out, what they did once they were teachers and who their family was.\n\nThe options are A (how young they look), B (what they wear), C (what they're like after school), D (what they did before they were a teacher) and E (who their family is). Some of these have a good chance of being relevant to someone's life. Considering how a high school teacher looks, we are less concerned with their family. Considering their outfits, we are less concerned about pre-teaching career history and how they're like outside of work. Considering who they are once school is out, we are less concerned regarding their pre-teaching life. Considering what they do after work, we are not interested in personal attributes or family members.\nLooking at these options, we can quickly narrow the choices.\n\nA - It says nothing about the family member of a teacher. It says nothing about the teacher's personality or how you might know them outside of the teaching sphere. It only specifies how young they might look.\n\nThis eliminates A.\n\\end{code}\n\nComment: you could have used two ```python scripts``` that checks the answers.

{"text": "fly', seems correct at first. It seems to indicate that if someone is suffering from anxiety, then it can only be caused by an injury and not talent.\n5. However, we have already eliminated that it's a physical injury. Therefore, Choice B is incorrect.\n6. Choices C and D, 'anxiety' and 'happiness', relate to mental states, but that does not explain why the person doesn't enjoy performing. \n7. The only remaining choices that could be plausible are 'anxiety' or 'energetic'.\n8. We know from Choice B that 'anxiety' is incorrect. \n9. Hence, the best answer is Choice C: anxiety.\nAnswer: C : antsiness\n\nInput: At breakfast, you can put eggs?

You can put eggs in toast or in a yolk for salad, etc., but can't put eggs in shirt.\nB: in your mouth You can't put eggs to your mouth.\nC: on your face We can put eggs on our faces for an egg facial.

{"text": "fly', is also irrelevant as it is not referring to a mental issue but rather an injury. \n5. Choice D, happiness, may seem to make sense as someone who is talented but doesn't perform often would, perhaps, be happy to not perform. However, the context implies this is untrue. \n6. So, as these three choices aren't correct, we can remove them from the list. \n7. Out of the remaining choices, we can see that Choice E, 'energetic', doesn't make sense with the context as this person is not motivated to perform even if they find energy.\n8. Therefore, the only answer choice left is Choice C, 'anxiety'.\n9. This is the best answer because it fits the context best.\nAnswer: C\n\nInput: She likes the best and most expensive clothing, what kind of person is she? Choices:  a) a hunter b) poor c) a model d) a rich e) a rich person can be a cheap person, it does not mean expensive e) rich is expensive so a rich person is expensive or poor because a rich person lives on a very basic wage c) most expensive shopping store\nRationales:\n1. The word 'expensive' does not necessarily mean 'rich'.\n2. Rich clothing does not equate to expensive clothing as rich people, depending on wealth, may purchase clothing from less expensive boutiques, so as to maintain a reputation to be exclusive.\n3. Similarly, a poor person would also not prefer the most expensive shopping.\n4. Therefore, we can choose to answer that she is a poor person or a rich person.\n5. Looking further at the answer choices, we can eliminate Choice A as we do not know whether she is a model.\n6. Choices B and D are both contradictory options given the context wherein she is described as possessing expensive taste.\n7. The only remaining option is Choice C, wherein '...is rich' is unnecessary as that is already implied.\n8. Therefore she is a rich person.\nAnswer: C", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "fly', is incorrect because although butterflies are generally positive feelings, a talent person can feel anxious or unsure before performing. In addition, butterflies can be a symptom of stomach ailments.\n5.

Choices:  a. apple b. celery c. eggplant d. strawberries e. carrots\nRationales: The question is asking about vegetables, so the given choices can be understood to be vegetables or fruits. \n\n1. Choice b, celery, is a stem vegetable rather than a fruit vegetable, so the answer is not celery.\n2. Choice c, eggplant, is classified as a vegetable but not a fruit.\n3. Choices d and e could be vegetables, as well as fruits, but they are not defined as a vegetable. Thus, not strawberries nor carrots are vegetables, so all the choices in C, d, and e, respectively, are non-vegetables.\n4. The remaining choices a and b, apple and celery, are both classified vegetables by default, but neither is specifically a vegetable so we leave both to be a non-vegan. \n5.

Study more for practice D. Take a nap E. Take extra time\nRationales:\n1. The question is about SAT practice. \n2. There is a strong tendency to choose options to relax oneself, but it's important to think carefully about which of these choices is best.\n3. The question indicates that taking the SAT at all is considered to be a stressful experience, but the questions are focused on practice, specifically the part about which to do next. \n4. Looking at each option individually, we can eliminate some answers which are more about relaxing: A: Relax and reassures itself has nothing to do with what's most important to do - it has more to do is with anxiety about not doing great. \n5. B: Ask questions and D: take a nap are in some ways even more so about anxiety than A - while they ask themselves about anxiety about the exam itself, it's not about what to do next. 6. Choices C and E are both about extra time: E is about how to spend the extra time. This doesn't fit because it's about what to do after taking the exam, whereas this question is more about what to do while still in the situation.\n7. Choices C and D are more specific as they both talk about taking a nap, but it's better to take a nap after the exam than while taking the exam. 8. This leaves E. Choice is taking extra time. \n9.

Only sandals are excluded in the choices as they have no special functionality to them. They are simply a type of footwear and not specific for any particular purpose.\n4.

Choices: A: office assistant B: laborer C: teacher D: scientist E: researcher\nRationales: In this question, we need to consider whether someone with a PhD qualification can make $100, 000 per year as an office assistant, laborer, teacher, or scientist, or if they might also make that amount as a researcher.\n\nLook at the options given to identify which one does not make sense:\n\nThe word \"office\" is more likely related to an administrative role, rather than physical labor. Therefore, a \"laborer\" is more likely to be a physical or manual worker, rather than someone with a PhD in one of the sciences: physics, chemistry or sociology, or with a doctorate in engineering.\n\nThe words \"teacher\" or \"scientist\" seem like appropriate choices. Looking more closely at'scientist' helps to identify that a person who works in a \"scientific\" area would likely work in a laboratory or field setting, performing experiments and researching, rather than someone in an administrative or managerial role.\n\nThe word \"researcher\" refers specifically to some type of scientific research, rather than in the areas of social sciences, engineering, or teaching.\n\nThis leaves the choices B: laborer and D: scientist, as", "answer": " 48"}

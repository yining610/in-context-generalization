{"text": "It would take one amoebae to divide into 15 amoebae and a total of 30 amoebae.\n\n### Explanation:An amoebae reproduces every two days, so on the first 4 days this would mean the original amoebae is doubled.\nThen on the next 4 days this original doubled amoebae is further doubled. And so on for each day. So in 4 days the original amoeba is doubled 7 times, and thus a total of 13, or 2 x 2.\n\nAlso on the 3rd day the original amoebe doubles in size so the 7 doubles are now 4 additional doubles. This leaves you with a new total of 11, or 2 x (2 x 2).\nIn the end on each of the first 2 days the amoeba doubles it's size, so on the 3rd it begins doubling after being doubled. The 4th day it doubles after being doubled the 3rd. And so on.\n\nIn this case, the amoeba reproduced 1 (the original) and doubled to 8, then doubled to 16.\n\n### Input:\"What is the name of the river that flows through Chicago?\n### Response:The river that flows through Chicago is the Chicago River.\n### Explanaton:This is a simple sentence that can be broken down.It is the Chicago River.In Chicago it flows.", "answer": " 8"}

One good example of this was figuring out how to make my first program print output on the screen instead of using an echo command.

We also know that each page can hold 11 cards. Since 7 cards are on 1 page, we see that there is no room left on the page after 7 cards. We must buy pages, so that each card can be in its own page. This means that we must have seven pages, not six.\n\n### Where the solution came from\n\nWe did some problem solving in the activity.

He already has 2 plates and has to buy 1 but not more because 2 people aren't using them.  All the days he only has one plate, there isn't any washing up to do.  On the days when he has more than one plate, he needs to buy two, then the person who needs just one in a week wouldn't be able to use them. Each person is already having to use two, so he needs to buy two to satisfy everyone.\n\n### Expand Your Skill\n\n### Improve the Question Based on the Demerit\n\nThe original question was unclear. \n\nThe question should be rephrased as such: \n\nMatt needs more plates but only 1 for himself and one for his son on average.  On the remaining 1 days of the week, he needs 2 plates because he will have guests to wash dishes with.  How many more plates does he need?\n\n### Expend Your Skill - The Question Was Rephased with Explains\nThe question states the number of people but the context was unclear. \nIt was stated that each person gets two for five days per week.  The person has to account for himself but also 1 guest on 2 of the 5 days.  This results in buying 3 more plates.\n\n### Improvise the Solution: Explains\n\nMats, the owner of one weekday, only needs one plate.  However, on Saturday the father, brother and son will each need one plate.  That totals 4 plates.  That is 1 plate short for his guests, not counting him.  Mats will need 5 plates.\n\n# 2\n### Instruction - Answer the following grade math question!\n### Demonstion -\n###", "answer": " 38"}

{"text": "I don't believe that the question is asking how many overtimes shifts you worked. I think that the question is looking for how many hours are in the workweek.\n\nFirst off, I think a person should find the days in which paychecks are received. Let's say the paycheck is every three days. If someone worked five days a week of regular scheduled hours, the person would receive a check at least five days. This would make it so that the person will collect at least ten checks a week. However, this is after taxes come out.\n\nThere are probably ways to calculate how much they made off of overtime, but I cannot do this. However, if the number of overtime hours is small enough, the answer won't be very large. For example, if one was to work one extra hour per day, this person will earn about $50. However, if a person was to work four extra hours, they will only earn about a $200 paycheck.\n\nSo with these conclusions, can we determine how many overtime hours were worked? I believe that the answer is 19 hours of overtime because a person works extra hours for about two days or something on the other hand.\n\n### Extra Information:  \nThe question is missing a little something that would help answer it. You have to consider if the person received all of their checks or not. If they didn't, it could impact the answer. \n\n### Input 2:\nA person will get an alert if they received payment from a source. Let's say someone gets an alert from a business, who hasn't received any money from the person yet. How much money has a person received from that business?\n\n\n### Response\nIf we are talking about a physical check in the mail, that is likely not to be the case. It is more likely to be a digital transaction that has not been verified yet. This means that there is no amount associated with it so there isn't one to report.\n\n### Input from 2nd day:\nSomeone might see an alert that they have earned 30 cents. This person is paid with digital tokens. The person gets three tokens each day, and you can accumulate up to 50 tokens per day. How many tokens are on the alert?", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "He spent $24.50.\n\n### Inputs:How long does it take a car traveling at 60 mph to get to the next light?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nYou have a car that is travelling at 60 m and you know that this takes 1 minute to cover 600 feet. If you want to travel a distance of 600 feet, then the car would have covered that distance once. The time required for travelling 600 feet is 1 minute. Thus by using the formula, the time taken by car to get to the next stop light is 1/(60) = 0.017 min.\n\n### Response (with corrections):\n\n-   It takes 1 minute to travel 1 mile, and you want to travel 600 feet? That is the same thing as traveling 600/1 mile which is equal to 600/60 which equals 10 min.\n-   You can't just assume a car is 600' long or travel at 60 miles per minute.\n-   Time for a car to travel through a mile = 1 min.\n-   To travel 6000 feet your car would need to travel 60 miles.\n\n### Additional comments:\n\nInput: What is the sum between 0 and 12?\n\nDemonstration:  Zero is less than 12, thus one needs to subtract and addition. One can add a one in order to make it equal to 12 (or take away 1 from ten). A new number is 11, but it is not equal to 12, so one only needs to add a 1. That means one needs to add a 2 to 11 to make it equal to twelve.", "answer": " 21"}

They find that there is a 24-hour day versus our own 24-hour cycle, but they find one difference between the two planets. On their planet the days are numbered differently, instead they just count from the hour to the minute. The scientist knows what time it is using Earth time as midnight.

As a result, Michael made 5(50) + 8(40) = 280 + 320 = $500.\n\n### Input\n```\nYou've bought $2.50 worth of gas. Based on your receipt, you've also spent $0.45 on a bottle of water, $0.11 on toilet paper, and you used 4.98 gallons. How much was the gas? How many bottles of water did you buy?\n```\n\n### Response\n```\nI have no idea how I came across this task, but it seemed like a really fun one to do.\n\nFirst, I would note that the gas was $3 and the water was $0.85 from looking at the receipt. So, the next step is to find out how many gallons of gas was purchased and how many bottles of water. Therefore, I would plug 4.98 into the formula to get gallons; however, the result is 5.18 and a conversion to liters will have to be done.\n\nNow that the gallons have been converted, the next thing is to find the cost for an amount of gas. After calculating, I came out with $1.038, so I had to plug this in to the formula to get a cost for one bottle and an amount of gallons in order to find an answer in liters.\n\nLiters: $5.18/0.6275 =9.119769,\nBottles:9.119/1.038/5 = 1.88911304 liters.\n\nSo, the answer to the question is the gas cost is $1.03 and water bottles was 1.89 of water.\n```\n\n## Task 4\n### Instruction\nI could write hundreds of programs that work properly.\n### Demontration\nInput: Write a program that does the following\n\nI could write hundreds  \nof programs that work properly\n\noutput: The program should print the instructions and run the program\n\n## Task 5\n### Instruction", "answer": " 1140"}

{"text": "Bella has 7 times more marbles than frisbees. Bella has 25 more frisbees and 15 more deck cards than she had originally. If she buys one fifth more of each, she would have 49 items if she has 45 right now.\n\n### Rationale\n\nFirst of all, there is enough data given to solve the problem.\nThe first part tells us that Bella has two times more marbles than she has frisbees. And we have the ratio of the marble to frisbees.\nThe second part tells us that she has 20 more of one compared to the other, which means she has 20 deck cards more than frisbees, which is equivalent to the ratio of marbles to frisbees, if the two ratios are reversed.\nTherefore, Bella has 5 more deck cards than frisbees and she has 15 more frisbee than deck cards. To solve for the final amount, we get 5x5: 25+15=40 deck cards.\nNext to that is the third part, which mentions that she bought more. In the first part, it says that 2/5 of more of each item, then that is what she buys. So in the second part, we can write x:x:10 for each item for her buys more, where x represent her current total of each item.\nSo 2x:2x:5 means that she has 40 deck cards, 15 frisbee, and 10 marbles.\nNow, we need to solve for the last part of the question with what she has left.\nSo 25+10+40=75. If it is true that she bought 2/5 times of each items, then she has 75-2/5:2:2:2:10.\nThe last part is to fill the blank, which we can do without difficulty knowing that we must have 2/5 times 2/5 each times on the top and on the bottom.

What is funny is that I gave myself a hard time when I couldn't do this. I wanted so bad to figure out how to make a program do this and I tried so hard. I never tried to ask anyone how to do this so I tried to figure it out all by myself. This was the time that I discovered that if you are too prideful then everything goes out the window. At that moment, I knew that not only did I not need to do this alone, but I also had so much help and resources. I needed to reach out for help but I also found out that I could help people.\n\n\n### Future Learning\n\nI feel that this really solidified programming for me. I had learned how to create programs but hadn't created a program in order to give a response, I just started writing and I found out that I was actually able to learn how to use new tools, learn new code, and program with the response.

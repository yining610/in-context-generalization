{"text": "A: ten\n\n\n### Solution:\n\n### First Example :\n\nA: A plumber must be thirsty a lot if he or she is thirsty on a dry day. If you think that this is a wasteful use of water, it doesn't matter how much it costs since there is no need for water. So if you are thirst it is likely that there are other sources of water such as fountains which could be used instead of the plumbing (which doesn't need to be used because theres other more efficient ways available).\n\nB: When a person is at work they still accomplish a lot of things and do many things so you cannot classify them as idle or tired or even resting. Their time is used effectively and productively so they work more than idle people and do not need to rest or take nap because their body isn't tired since they never relax completely at their job.\n\nC: A person might find pencils with company logos on them but they are not the ones that you would use to write and they are used to write words and sentences so that's why you might not find them.\n\nD: A person doesn't usually whisper to someone who is working or making any sound because they would listen to that sound.\n\n### Second Example:\n\nA: The pears she has are ten so she has to give 10 apples and 10 oranges to her sister and she would be left with no fruits except pears which doesn't make any difference. The fruits that she has now is ten and that's how much she would be left with after giving away two pears of each fruit.", "answer": " 44"}

When I was in grade math, there was always some answer that I was unable to work out.  But I'd still say, \"I am unable to get this one done\".  But in Python, there is nothing that will tell Python to skip a question. \n\nThe only simple solution I can think of, I've just skipped these question.

We can write that as $d(x)=h(x)$.\n\nBut $x^2$ is another term we know and can be called as $e(x)$\n\n$e(x)`=input  * input^2=d(x)\n\nIn mathematical notation, we can write it as e(x)=d(x)=hx. So we can write as e(x)=hx\n\nIn which value $x$ would be replaced in the function\n\ne(x)=h(g(x))\n\nB: h(g(x))=e(h(x))\n\n$B$\n\n$A$\n\n### Question B\n\nWe can assume there are already some elements into the array\n\nLet us define an element $a$.\n\nAnd then we can define a new elements $b$.\n\n$a=2$\n\n$b=3 $\n\n$Array[0] = a`\n\n`Array[1]=b`\n\n`Array [2] = 1`\n\n`Array(length ) = 3 `\n\nTo find the length of the array, we can call `length` that will be 3\n\n### Question C\n\nWe can think of a loop as an infinite cycle of instructions", "answer": " 98"}

We want the wood to the left of everything, the cotton in the middle, and the plastic to the right of that.  The height of these materials are always measured to the top of them.  We cannot have a place with all cotton, or with all plastic over cotton or plastic.  What shape is the bed?\nOutput: Let us list the dimensions now. Length = X width, height = Z height. The width of the bed = X which can be equal to L (their length times the cotton, plastic, wood is L, length) or (X < L < X+L). This can also be X + or X + L/2. So, 0 = X < L < X+ L/2 = L or X + L = 2L. (This is the plastic, cotton, wood, width or X.) The height of bed = Z = 5. (5) can be 0 = X < Z or X + Z. This can be equal to only 1 and 2. So, Z = 5 and 1 = X < Z or 2 = X + Z.  The minimum volume: L(5) = 5X + 25 and the maximum volume: L(5)+(X+Z)=3X = 50. Solve for X (you can ignore the small cases of 0 and X=L) (and get the case of X+Z = 1). Then multiply X + Z by 2 and divide by 5. (5X+Z)/5. The length of the bed is (5x)/5, (30/5) = 6 with a maximum height of Z = 5. So, the shape is either X = 6 Z (X=6 is not allowed if X is greater than L, Z is greater than 1 since it is not possible to put wood over and below cotton and plastic in the bed (0). So, X = L/2 if L is a multiple of 2. Also, if X is even, Z must", "answer": " 448000"}

Under the ```markdown``` there should a description of the question (this file will need to be updated each day). The format of the questions are:\n```\n### Question\n\nInstruction:Answer the following question(s).\\\nThere will be two options for each question, where one of them are correct.\n\n`### Answer to Question`\n\n**Input:** _question_\n\n**Output:** _correct option and description_\n\n`### Example`\n\nWhere could you find some plumming that would not be of no use to you if you were thirsty?

I'll have a look at the code and do my best to correct anything that is not on the code). To do this, you will be creating **example.py** file which needs to create the functions that will run to the code block.

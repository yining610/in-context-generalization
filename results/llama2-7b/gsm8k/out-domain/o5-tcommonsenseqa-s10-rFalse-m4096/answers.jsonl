Each time the person rides this vehicle he travels a distance at a certain speed. \n\n### Instructions:\nYou will answer a series of questions about how a vehicle travels on flat sand in mile per hour.  How Conner rides this vehicle is as follows: \n\n\n### Input Options\nThe possible input options and responses are listed below.\n\n* [A] Traveling on flat sand at 60 miles per hours\n* [B] Travelling on flat sand at 40 miles per hour\n* [C] Riding on flat sand at 30 miles per hour\n\n\t* [D] Riding uphill at a speed 15 miles per hour slower than riding flat sand\n\t* [E] Traveling Downhill at a speed 12 miles an hour faster than riding on flat sand\n\t*  [F] Riding a flat sand for a distance of 100 miles at a rate of 60 miles an hour\n\t* [G] Riding on downhill at a speed of 10 miles an hour faster than flat sand\n\t\n\n\n### Response Options:\n* [A] 180 miles hour\n* [B] 100 miles per hours\n\n### Detailed solution:\nYou know that each time Conner rides the vehicle it takes the same time to travel a distance. The reason for this is that the vehicle is always the same and travels at a constant rate. You can see from the equations above that 60 is added to flat sand when you ride up a hill and 60 is added again to the flat sand portion of the buggy.\n![alt text](./images/2.JPG \"2\")\nYou can notice that 60 miles an hr was subtracted to the buggy on flat sand. Conner then decides to drive down hill on the sand and 15 miles per the is subtracted to the vehicle after rideing up the hill. \n![alt text](images/3.JPG \"3\")", "answer": " 58"}

{"text": "Max has 8 trains for a year when he turns 16, the same number when he turns 17, and 16 the next year (for a year when he turns\n18). By the second year, he's asking for 10 times as many trains as he wants.  At the end, he doesn't really end up with a lot of extra\ntrains, because of all the times he didn't get that many.  Max gets at least two for his birthday and two for Christmas each year, and his\nparents make it possible that he gets more, so he never has to go without what he wants by the end. If we take the number of trains he wants at the end to be 8, then the number of trains he gets for Christmas and for his 16th birthday is 4.  His birthday for 15th year is one more train, and his 17th birthday is another.  In the end, he has 8 + 4 + 5 = 17 trains, or 16 because he gets double the number of trains at the end, 16 + double(16) = 33 - 16 = 17, so one more train and he's up to 18.

{"text": "The store received 8 pallets of paper cuisines. There total of pallets the store received was 20 and half were of different types of paper products. So it would make sense that the other half were of paper cups.\n\n#### Input:A store received two pallets of paper products. Half the pallets are paper towels,a quarter of paper towels,and a fifth are paper plates. The remaining pallets were paper cups. They received 30 pieces of paper products. What type of paper cups did they get?\n\n#### Response:they received ten pallets of paper cuises. The store received 30 pieces but they already stated it was a quarter of the pallets that had paper towels.

The store received a quarter of all the bags of paper towels. But in this one it said 12 bags so you need to multiply by 720 to have 9,900. Thats right because you multiplied by 720 you get 9,901.

If he takes 9 days from Monday-Sunday he walks 3 times as many miles, how long does it take him to walk from Monday-Sundays?\n\n\n### Response.\nFirst,I found how many minutes it would take from Monday-Sundey which added up to be 990. That is because after Monday at 5 minutes he would reach Sunday and then add 9 more days. \nNext, I found how many times he walks 5 miles since he walk 5 miles 3 times as much. That is because he would walk 5 miles 6 times. \nThen lastly, I found out how many miles he walks. That is because 3 times 5 is 15 and then 15 times 6 is 84, but 990 adds up to 1.04. That means that his walk will exceed 990 minutes.\n\n### Solution\n-\n\nThe first thing I did was I made a table.  Then, I did some math to see how long it would take him. I made a table of columns and rows of all the time it would take because I thought he would be going 5 miles the whole way until he got to Sunday and then on Sunday he would only walk 5 minutes.  So if he walked from Monday-Sundy it would be a total of 4 days worth the 5 miles. Now, the time it takes is from Monday to Sunday. So from Monday-Sundu it is 1 day and then Sunday it is 5 minutes which is 4 days worth of minutes because in 1 day from Monday to Sunday, he does not walk 5 miles 4 times. Because it would be 4 times Monday and then 1 time Tuesday to Sunday. so, I figured that it would take 84 minutes or 5.4444 hours. Now, the 9th day since it is from Monday to that Sunday and Monday is day 5. Now, he walks 4 days worth of mileage which is four days worth of Monday", "answer": " 112"}

You may not be looking at this as strictly mathematics, but for me, I still will submit using numbers in my answer. For the first year, $150 went into the bank. (Missy's question: \"How much money in dollars did she put in the piggy bank last year?\" She did not say how much money she added.)  I think what the wording is trying to ask is \"What was the amount of money in dollars she added (including all 4 years combined)\". So, for the first year, she added $450.

{"text": "8\n\n### Explanation:Let:\n\nN = Number of weeks\n\nB = 15\n\na = 5 days of training\n\nb = 1 rep added to a day\n\n1. If he trained 5 days for 15 reps it means first 5 weeks he will do wall push-ups everyday, total = 15\n2. In next 5 weeks he will add 1 rep a day, but will get to 15 repps that week(if he does) It means he will do another 5 weeks on 15 reps, since he needs to train next 2 weeks on 15reps only, he will have to practice next 2 weeks too, that makes 6 weeks total(for 2 weeks, 15reps, 5 days, and 2 weeks of 14 reps).\n3. In next 4 weeks he will add 2 rep a day, and total 15 reps again, but it takes 5 weeks to practice 2 reps, that means he needs 5 total weeks to complete training, and 5 plus 4 plus 6 makes 15 reps total. 15reps = 8 weeks(in 8 weeks he can do atleast 15 reps) total training time = 9 weeks (which is atleast 9, if he has some sick days or can't do all, that he needs 8-2 = 6 weeks to get to 15)\n4. For training high elevation pushups, it will take 5 weeks again, if he gets again 15 reps for that week, it will be 2 months of training atleast(because it took 4 weeks for 2 reps).  And if that happens, next 4 weeks on 2 reps will be 6 weeks of training, and his total is 9 weeks and 6 weeks again makes it 15 weeks.\n5. For training low elevation push ups, next 2 weeks will make it 7 weeks training.\n6. For training on ground, next 5 weeks will make it to total 15weeks of training.\n\nSo it will be = 8+2+6+5+4 = 25 weeks(atleast)\n\n### Dem", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Jake drank 0.02883333330.53030303 pounds of pure alcohol.\n\n### Input Example:\nA: 500 mL of water are in a container for a hydroelectric power station. The water flows through hoses at a rate of 10 gallons per minute.  If the water needs to flow through four more hoses, how many kilometers can the system provide electricity?\n\n### Solution:\n\nWater is less dense than air so we don't need to account for the weight of the air in the tank.  The hosing is probably a fairly narrow hosing, so the hosing is not going to do any significant loss in speed.  Thus for a single pipe in a hosing system: \n\n10 gallons at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is standard temperature for power stations, weigh 20 pounds and will flow at 8.3 gallons per 20 minutes, which is a 99.3% efficiency.\n\nSo in this example:\n\n500/8.3 = 59.08\n\nSo if the 500 gallons water is in one hose and all of those hoses are replaced into the system we have\n\n59.08^4 = (500)/8.3  or 500 is 59.17\n\nAs you can see, the system can handle over 80 miles of heights before burning out again.\n\n### Other Examples:\n\nB: 0.1632231116322 miles of elevator line are installed in a factory.  The 16 inch pipes deliver 20 gallons of water for every two minutes the elevator is in a tunnel.  If the elevator operates for 32 hours, then how many cubic meters of water do the pipes pump in a day?\n\nC: 0.3 miles of tunnel are carved through a mountain in order to operate a mine.  It takes 8 gallons of water every five minutes to operate the mine. If the mine is on for 8 hours a day, how many gallons of water does the mine use in a week?\n\n##", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "I asked Mr. P to explain how to do this problem. He explained that you need to find the hourly rate of creating the pair of shoes. Hourly rate = (Cost + hourly rate charged  * hours) / hours. Since the cobbler is creating the new pair of shoes for 8 hours, you would need to divide the cost by 8. Since the cobb will charge Bobby 80% of that, you need to subtract 80%. So  Bobby paid 102.45.\n\nThe cobbler's hourly rate was $46.45\nBobby was charged $308.52\nAsked price: $300.00\nHourly rate = (300 + 46.45 * 8) / 8\nHourly rate:  $46.47 = 46.47\n$308.50 - $46.46\n$262.04\nI asked if this meant that the cobbler would charge Bobby $262 + Bobby could negotiate with the cobbler. Bobby suggested that instead the cobbler should just charge Bobby $260. Mr. P said that that was a good idea that he would show his customer. Both Bobby and Mr. P were pleased with the outcome.\n\nMr. P said he would like to find out what the cobbler was charging for the different hours because sometimes he goes above the 80% minimum.\nMr. P also asked if he should find out if Bobby would be paying for his own pair of shoes, or if he was the cobbler's employee.

{"text": "42, 115 minutes per movie\n\n### Explanation:\n\nGrandpa Lou could have watched 115 movies on Tuesday. The maximum number of movies Grandpa Lou could have watched on Tuesday is 2 movies per hour, but since Grandpa Lou watched movies for 23 hours on Tuesday, there were 115 moves he could have watched. Next, I can subtract the number of hours that I already calculated for Tuesday from the total number of hours that Grandpa Lou watched on Tuesday. In this case. I subtract 23 hours from 23 hours resulting in 1 hour, Grandpa Lou could have finished the other six movies, so Grandpa Lou could have seen a total of 2 movies per 115 minutes. The question asks me what the maximum number of movies could have watched, so we want to go from movies per 1 hour, which is the maximum number of moves that could have watched as well, to movies per 147 minutes, or 2\u00bd hours. I can use division to divide the 2 movies per movies per 122 minutes, or 2 hours, by 2, that is, 1 movie per 122/2 = 34, so we can round that number down to 33\u2154. Then, I can add 115 to 33\u2345 to get 147\u2154. So that's how I divided 115 minutes into 222 minutes, by 2, to get the maximum number of movable movies, which is 42.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "If we let c represent coat purchases, t represent t-shirt purchases and j represent jean purchases, then the overall expense was C + 3c + 2t. Taking that into account and simplifying it to 2c + 6t, we can then combine like terms and see that the sum of the expenses is 20c + 12t. Since the overall expense is more than Carly's, Lisa's t-shirt expense must be more than Carly'st. Thus c would be the most expensive since it's a combination of the expenses. Since Carly's overall expense is less than Lisa's, her coat expense must be less than Lisa's. Thus c is less than Lisa'st by $4, so c = 16. Since Lisa's overall expense must be more, t would be the next most expensive since it can't be less than c. t = 14. Finally, to get Carly's total, we combine our three expenses and multiply by 2. 16 + 4(14) + 2(12) = 36 + 56 = 92", "answer": " 230"}

Mr. Grey did not pay for the items he purchased.\n\nTherefore the cost of the items will be subtracted by the rebate. And hence the cost after rebate.\n\n### Output: Input: $3599.5-3629.5/1.1=$20.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n```\nOutput:1. The output is the number of minutes it will take to make $3629 in cash with an interest rate of 2.05% per quarter. The formula used:\n\n1. PV = $3599\n2. FV = $3629.\n\nPV = FV / (1+ i/n). PV is present value. So here is the present value of $3599, \nwhich is the same as $3629 that you will make by the end of the quarter.\n\n2. n= 1, which means the question does not refer quarterly payment.\n3. i = 0.05/4 = 0.0125, which is 1.25% interest rate per quarter.\n\nThe formula used:\n\nPV = 3629 / (1+ 0.01/4) So since that the question does not refer payment frequency,\ni = 1.25%. So 1.25 = 0.0875 and hence we need to multiply it by 4.\n\nTherefore i becomes 0.35% / 4 = 0.11= 1.1%.\n\nNow PV = 3699 / (1+1.25%) So we need to multiply the numerator and denomator by 4.\nTherefore 3629/ (1+ 0,0125) So 3629 = 3625 since we donot need to multiply the numerators by 4 \n\nTherefore 3/ (1+0,01/4) = 0.362", "answer": " 322"}

He had 4 since 4 oranges + half of 4 oranges leaves him with 4. Then he gave away half of what he was first given which was half of 4. Since he now has half of what he was given initially, which is originally 4, to give away half of what was given he needs to give away which is half of 4 or in other words 2 because 4/2 is 2. So Seth firstly had 4 oranges but now he has 2 left out of the 4 he had. This is because he purchased 4 oranges and gave away one half of those he purchased at the beginning.

This is just two steps in order to show that this process works to find the answer to a question.\n\n`3.59 * 3.59`\n`===> 13 * 3.55`\n\nYou can see, by solving 0.04, that the answer is actually.\n\nB:\n\n`x^3 = 3.5 * 4 ==> (x^3) = 3.5`\n\n`9.4 = sq.rt.x`\n\n`x= 9.4 = sqrt(988)`\n\n`x = sqrt(x2+ 453)^0.5 ==> (9.4)^0.5`\n\nThe answer comes to 3.2187 in this approach.\n\nFor this response I did not put the math on top of the graph.\n\n### Input\\\nA farmer gives away 5 hens. \nIf every other hens the total of 5 chickens is given away. \nHow many chickens did", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Based on a two-hour a day, five-day-a-week study. These kids, based on a 30 day month, watch 30 * 5 - 2 = 85 hours of television each month which is 12 days of watching 7 hours each day, so 5 days of watching, 2 hours each day for the two weeks they are allowed to watch. 85 days of 60 minutes each adds to 5,250 minutes each month.  So, 12 days at 15 hours a day is 180 hours each day which is 2160 minutes a day: 12 + 15 = 27 * 4 = 108 Hours. Since 108 hours is much shorter than 5,256 minutes; you must multiply it by 60, because there are 60 minutes in one hour, and you must multiply 108 by 4, because you are watching that many hours of television on the 4 days that they are allowed to watch TV: 108 * 60 = 6,432 minutes of watching TV which is the equivalent to four and a half days.

I placed 5% of the worker ants in either the 1s or 2s.\n\n```\n\nColumn 1\nColumn 2\nColumn 3\nColumn 4\nColumn 5\nColumn 6\nColumn 7\nColumn 8\n```\n\n```\nMale \nFemale \nWorker \nMale \nWorker  Male \nWorker  Male Male Female \nWorker  Female \n```\n\n### Output:\nI have 96 female worker ants.\n\n### Demo:\n\n![enter image description here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80198760/130386448-434b0ce2-03c7-488d-bc4a-59190a1d0f92.png)\n\n### Source:\n[Source 1](https://github.com/SarAlix/Grade-Math-Questions)", "answer": " 44"}

{"text": "I think we would need to convert all of these hours to a decimal first, and then we would need them to an actual number. I think we start with the hours she\u2019s mowed lawns as that is $6 an hour. And that is 388.666667 rounded and with my answer being 388. That gives us 77.6666 an hour for weeds and mulch. 10 for weed and mulch would be 11 if it includes lawn. So our money is going to be $838. I think it works this way because, lawns get multiplied by $6, weed and mulch are multiplied by $11 and there was 10 hours of weed and mulch but they rounded the hours of 10 down to 77. So this is what I got. \n\n### Note:\nWe are allowed to leave a cell empty if there is no calculation necessary. And we can leave  a subtraction and division cell as a blank.", "answer": " 567"}

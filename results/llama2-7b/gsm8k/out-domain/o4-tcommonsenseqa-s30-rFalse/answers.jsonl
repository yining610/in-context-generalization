{"text": "319\n\n### Rationale:  Let's first find that the final weight is 319 pounds.\n\nThe initial weight was 2 pounds because jelly beans are a light item.\n\nThe item was increased by one third, so the item must be (2 x 3) + 2 pounds.\n\nKen poured enough brownies to multiply the item by three.\n\nThe second item is twice heavier than the prior one.\nThen, the item is the double of the new one. And that is (2 x 3)-3. Finally, the box is filled with gummy worms, which are just as heavy as jelly beans. The total weight is (2 x 9 x 9) + (3 x 9) + 2 pounds = 319 pounds\n\n\n### Instructions\n\n\n**Expectations** \n\nThese instructions come from a wide range of applications. For example, the instructions could be taken from a user manual, a safety warning, an email, a chatbot, or a website.  Your job as a programmer is to ensure that the user fully understands and is able to perform each task as specified.  Your program should respond with an appropriate code to each given condition.\n\nIn each chapter, you will be given a task with instructions for what a user should do to meet a given goal. You should complete these instructions by writing your own program, using Python. You may submit multiple response programs. \n\n**Evaluation**  \n\nYour programs will be rated for quality and correctness.  In a submission there are different categories for a given test case. For example, a correct program for the above instructions could be rated with 4 stars for quality and 4 for correctness for a given test case and 1 star for quality and 0 for correctness for another test case. The points for each test case will be:\n\n1. 1 for a correctly submitted program in general (a program that is written in Python and submits to the test input)\n2. 1 if the quality of a response was 4 Stars\n3. 1 if the question was answered correctly\n\n\nThe following test cases were also given:\n\n1.

In order to see how differently priced they are, we must first convert the bulk warehouse into 12 cans since we are comparing it to its competitor, then we must first convert the grocery store to the same amount, to allow for comparison.

Andy spend $6 on the snacks he bought and Bob spend $13 for his snacks. The total amount each guy buys is 19$. Andy bought a can of $1 and 2 hamburgers, each meal cost $2. Bob bought 2 sandwiches that each costs $3 and 1 fruit drink. From the question, we subtract Bob's snacks costs from Andy's amount to find out the amount Bob spent. Bob bought drinks with an inrcrease because the drinks he bought cost $3 and he bought more the drinks than Andy, so 5 sandwiches - 4 hamburgers = 1 burger, therefore the cost of his drinks is $16 and his total snacks cost is $13.\n\n### What: You are writing your own response to the instructions you were given.\n\n### Example: For this example, you will write the answer to an instruction in a math equation.\nThe second and third rows in the table below are complete.

And the next value will come from my fruit list.\n\nI can't put another index, so I just gave the second value a name, \"fruit\" and the answer was \"apple\".\nThen when you use the variable, you can say \"i in fruit\", you're doing \"i\" in all the items in fruit list.\n\nSo if we loop through the loop", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "I will assume 7/3=2, so each day the washer can handle up to two more towels, so I will choose to assume that you will use 101 towels to keep with the numbering of the question. If I can do that than I will use 100 and 101 in one day, but since I cannot, well, I still think I can get this correct, but maybe I miscalculate. For the washing cycle, my understanding is that the number of towels in a washing load is always used as a factor of the number of loads that were there, and there is no such thing as \"exact load\" for any reason with any method known to mankind. As one of the examples here, the number of towls should be able to have two exact matches in a single load, so I choose to apply that formula for this. The towels themselves are so many that I have no reason to even count how many will be used for each family, let alone how much will be left since, for example, you use 15 and a total towl usage of 22 for one load which will require 6 or 7 other loads. Let's assume that if there are towes left over that you do the math, and if you can't make that choice that I need to change.", "answer": " 6"}

So now I traveled 15 miles from town to town and I doubled the amount I had traveled so I had traveled 31 miles. I now had to add 135 miles to get the total. So the answer was 266 miles. I doubled 135 so it was going to be 330, but there were two ways to get to the capital. One way I had to travel from my town to the city where the capital was in another. I then had to drive 15 miles from the city where the capitol was and 135 miles from my town for the total. The sum of the two trips I had to go on is 330 miles. The second trip I had to go on was 165 miles, and since this is the trip that counts twice the distance I had traveled was 330 from my town to the capitol.

{"text": "As shown above, in each of the questions, what is true about them is that the answers are either E or D and only one. If the person answer one D or one E, then the person knows that he gave a correct response. Another observation is that if the person gives a different answer, the person definitely is wrong. If in any case (and it would not occur in these questions), the question did not provide the answer choice. However, a similar case maybe encountered in the exam (and will definitely be on the test), a correct answer will be given without the answer choice. In such case, it would be difficult for the person to know that he did not give a correct response or was wrong. To ensure that the person identifies mistakes on the test, and he/she knows he/she has done wrong, the instructions should be written in a way that the information being looked for by the person is found at the end of the questions.\n\n### Solution:\nIn addition to the above observation, there is another one.\n\n### Input\n\nThe test will consist of a series of instructions in which a task is given.

Write a response that describes a plan for solving the problem.\n\nIn a test, the person is given a series of question where each question will follow by instructions. For each instruction, the person needs to write a response that complete the task and this will be a response to instructions.\n\nIn the example below, in each of the above questions (except the first), the only acceptable answer is either a D or an E and the person can find an answer only when he writes the instruction: a person is holding a poker game night. However, this is not always the case and it would not be fair if each question has instructions to write a response that has no correct answer. For this reason, each question should have the correct choice with the answer and all other choices (excluding the actual correct answer) should be incorrect.\n\nBelow is an instruction that describes an open ended task.

Only call a method when you have been authorised to do so. (See the documentation for options.) If you are unsure how to detect if a user has selected an invalid option, do not attempt this hint. It's better to do what you understand.\n4. You will not use the other methods for the remaining part of the script.\n\n### Options:\nStandard input: One or more Strings\n\n### Output:\nDo not print anything to standard output. Your program will be displayed and evaluated on Screen-o-matic.\n\n### Input Validation / Error Handling:\n1. For example, if there was an option to say no, you could use the option `!` to mean say no. This is similar to using the value `false` in other programming languages.\n2. You may wish to provide error messages when possible, although if your solution involves printing to standard", "answer": " 2200"}

She picked 15 random students from a class of 55 students. Then, she asked each student how many types of trees she could name. 18% of the students answered exactly the same number, 10% of the students answered a number that was 5 less than that of the first 2 groups, 7% of the students answered 10 higher, and 67% of the students gave random answers. What was the average answer?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nExample: If the person you asked answered 2, then the sample size that you take is the first group of respondents: from the original 55 students.\n\n### Output: 142857\n\n### Demo:\n\nExample: So the size of the sample, 1000, is the first group of students. We multiply it with the number of students that answered exactly the same (200), and we get \n\n200*(1000) = 200000\n\n### Demo (Answers):\n\nI. If someone asked me how many types of trees I knew, I would probably just name the trees that I can find in my country, such as pine, oak, eucalyptus, etc. If I name more than 10 types of trees, I will probably know nothing of all the different types of trees in the world. So to answer this question, I just need to know that I could only name 7 different types of trees, but there was one type of tree that I did not know.\n\nII. Now the next question I have, if someone asked me how many hours does each student practice for a grade? Which one should I answer? But one thing I need to find is the total amount of time spent, so if I assume a random number of people are asked the question:\n\nExample: Each student spent 100 hours of practising on the piano.\nIn this way, I can multiply the numbers as a percentage with the average time.", "answer": " 148"}

{"text": "7 pills per day, which is twice as many blood pressure pills and insulin pills, that is a total of 14 pills per day. And she takes that over seven days, she will have a total of 101 pills a week.\n\n### Explanation\n\nWe start by counting the pill that Holly takes each day which she took:\nblood pressure pills and insuines. She takes a total of 1 insulin and 1 blood presure. Then we multiply 1 times, 7, so we get the number of pill she will have in a day. The result will be a total of 2 x 7 pills per day which is 14 pills. Then we repeat that process each week, we multiple how many pills she has per day and the result is a total of 7 pills per week. We multiply 7 by 7, 2 x 2 to get the total number of pills in a week. The result is a total of pills 101. \n\n### Discussion:\n\nThis is the right answer because Holly actually took 66 pills on Sunday, so the answer is correct.

Also, it depends on the species.  It would make more sense to provide the median life span.\n\nThe answer should be 7.5 years or the median life span because we have 4 different animals, which we cannot multiply together so we must provide the median life span of those 4 animals.  In this case, the median life span is 7.5 so then the median becomes 7.5.\n\n### Explanation\nFirst we must calculate each animal's life span since its important to note that there are 4 animals whose life span we can multiply together to get a final total answer.\nLife span calculation for dogs: 75-yr average dog lifespan/6= 12.5 years\nLife span calculation for hamsters: 2.5-yr average hamster lifespan/6 =.41666\nLife span calculation for cats: 30-yr average cat lifespan/6.3 for an extrapolated 2-yrs = 30/6.3= 4.68 years\nLife span calculation: 4.68 + 12.5+.4 + 30 = 8", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "There are 6,200 nuts in the car.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nIf you look at the question and see the choices, it helps to look at the choices to see what information is given for each choice. Since all of the choices contain information about the number of squirrels and how many nuts each squirrel stores or the number of days the store, you can deduce that this is a math problem. It's easy to just use the choices to do the math and deduce the answer, but that isn't allowed on this challenge.\n\nWhat is given is that 2 squirrels store 30 nuts a day, and 1 stores 20 a day and they do this for 40 days. So, you can figure out that the total number of nuts the two squirrels store is 600. You can then figure out that one squirrel stores 400 nuts. So there are 1,000 nuts in all by the end of the time.\n\nIf there are two squirrels and one squirrel stores an extra 20 nuts, is there enough for the three squirrels? Well the answer is no if you think about it. If there are three squirrels and you don't store anything there's not enough food to last the two extra days. This is what the 6,202 would reflect.\n\n### Example: The above question uses the information given. You can go through step by step and answer the question by putting numbers on each choice. It is easier to do math like this if you have the choices broken down.", "answer": " 3200"}

Each evening he brought home a small sample of a specific element so he could discover what would happen to it once it came under the light of a certain star or planet. One night, he went to the lab and set the element near a lamp, which he expected to have the same effect on the element as the rays of the sun. But he was shocked to see that it didn't do a single thing. Frustrated, he decided to try again the next day, but the results were no longer as expected.\n\nAs the scientist tried again and again, he noticed something very odd was happening to his element. Each time it was set under the light of the new star or planet, it did no damage to the sample element - it even enhanced its powers, he claimed. After his observations, he was convinced by his conclusions and decided to write a report of his findings. He described how setting the element under the light of a new place each day was changing its molecules. Because of this new element, he was now capable of detecting other elements that were otherwise invisible to him.\n\nBased on the report, what happened to the element once it came under the new place's light? Choices A: it was converted to another element.  B: it lost some of its properties.  C: it gained additional properties.  D: it was set on fire.  E: it became a completely different element.\n\n                 \t\tI chose that It gained additional properties because it gained additional properties.\n\n\n### Democratics\n###   In the summer of 2004, a few friends", "answer": " 99"}

{"text": "Twenty cents\n\n### Input & Output\n\n### Input\nA scientist is carrying out a laboratory experiment which needs to measure the temperature of boiling water. In order to obtain accurate measurements they first have to boil the water and then record the measurements. However, the temperature of the room the lab is located in is constantly changing, and this should be subtracted from the overall measurement.\n\nThe scientist has found that the temperature of the room is always 20\u00b0C above the actual temperature of the water. This is given as the room temperature. He also knows that each degree of heat he gains, i.e. from 20\u00b0C, will increase the temperature of his water by the same fraction. If he subtracts 25\u00b0C from each measurement he is guaranteed to obtain an accurate measurement for the temperature of the water.\n\n### Output the answer in a single line, without any leading spaces, a tab at the starting position and a trailing blank.\n\n### Solution & Explanation:\n\nThe scientists room temperature - which is the base for the whole calculation - is 100\u00b0C.

{"text": "20\n\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nLet us look at Figure 10-1. Nate did not find his car at all. He searched every single row in section g, and he searched all of the rows in section h. \n\nIn section g, the rows contains 15, and each contains 10 cars. So there are more cars in section g than in section h. 10 cars in section g will take 15 minutes to search for his car. \n\nSo Nate went through 15 minutes in section g which is a search of 1500 seconds. \n\nNow he searches section h. So in section h there are 20 rows with 9 cars in each. That is 180 cars, which will take 1900 seconds. 1500 + 1900 = 3400 seconds.\n\nSo the total time Nate spent is actually 3400 secs to search. If 3400secs is equal to 58 minutes. So 58minutes would have been the correct answer. He did not search the entire car park because he missed out on a few rows in section g. \n\nHe actually spent a total of 58 minutes searching the car park but 8 minutes will be taken up while he is walking between the sections. 58 minutes x 60 seconds per minute = 3480 seconds and 3480/60 = 58 minutes. This explains answer 58 minute.\n\nIt goes on like,\n\nNate searched for a total of 17048 seconds which is equal to 283m and 2s.\n\n\n### Example:\n\n* Input: You need to call your brother, but your brother's phone number has been lost.

How many red marbles does Eric have.\n\n### Response\nEric has 12 marbles.\n\n#### Explanaton:\nLet's assume we entered 24. Half of the white marbles are blue. Since we enter 24 the blue marbles must be 12.\n\n### Explanation:\nYou will need the count method in this function. The function accepts one argument and should return a number. This number is the answer to the question. It is possible that the answer will not meet the constraints. This is why you would make the number negative. The negative number is then added to the constraints. This function could be a lot easier using an object.\n\n#### Expanation:\nIf you have a function that takes two arguments you could store two values inside of objects. You could then call your function and have the program return a value that is between -1 and 2. The reason that it will be between 1 and 2 is because a constraint can not be less than 1 and a negative number is less than a 0. You could modify your constraints as needed.\n\n```javascript\nfunction difference(num) {\n  const nw = num;\n    for (let x = nw, index = 0; index < 19; x += x, index++) {\n    return 1;\n    }\n    console.log(nw);\n}\n\ndifference(25);\n```\n\nBelow are tests that a teacher might conduct to assess students' knowledge of the language concepts taught throughout the unit.\n\n## Tests:\n\n  - Instruction:Tod", "answer": " 2"}

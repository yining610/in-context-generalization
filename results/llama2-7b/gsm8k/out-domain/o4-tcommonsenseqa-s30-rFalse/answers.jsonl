{"text": "B: 79 questions\n\nInput: You are driving on a 134 mile dirt road and are on the edge of a rain forest. After 20 miles you come upon a camp and it says it is 114 miles from another road. At this camp you realize you must have taken a wrong turn. How do you figure that out, or determine where to go next? Choices:  I must stop at every camp and in town and determine where to go next because I want to get there with as few problems as possible A: C: D: E:\nOutput: B: D: The best way to do this would be to figure out whether there were any other camps besides the one you passed through, which is 114, and see what the other camps said. If there are more, then one of the camps would have to be 134 miles from the start of the dirt road because it is 134 miles long.  If that is the case, but you know your destination is more than 134 miles away, you would have to do some quick math to determine whether 134 is greater than or less than or equal to the difference between one camps distance and your destination.  In that scenario, you would subtract 114 and 134. The difference would be 20, and if that number is less than or equal to 134, it works out to 13, you passed one of the first camps. So to conclude, you would look at the camps sign posted. If the other camps were 114, 83, 52, or 0 miles away from the start of the road, then yes you have gone in the wrong direction. If not, then keep driving until you get there or you run out of gas.\n\nInput: How might you determine if 2019 is divisible by 11?

See [ask].\n\nAnswer: The questions in the file are lines of text, not variables.

{"text": "15 more Gallons\n\nInput: Find the common factor of 12 and 22. \n\n**Solution:** The common factor of two numbers is the number (integer) that divide the two numbers and leave no remainder. The common factor of two given integers `a` and `b` is denoted as `g(a, b) = a\\ b` where \"\\,\" denotes the division operation.\n\nIn order to find the common factor, we need to divide both the terms by the greatest `common divisor` of the two numbers. This will make all the multiples of the greatest common divisor to be the common factor of the two numbers.\n\nTo determine the greatest common divisor, or GCD, of two numbers, divide them, until only ones that leave remainders of zero. Then they are the same and then that result is a common factor. When the result is not a number, the difference of the two numbers is the greatest common divisor. \n\nExample:\n`Find g(12,22).`\n\n`g(12,2)`  = 2 \n\n`g(36,22)` = 6\n\n`g(22,22)` = ` 1 `\n`So,`\n\n`g = `2 or 6\n\nThe last two examples (2, 4) and (1, 1) do not work since the greatest common factor is (the greatest common divisor) the number 1. Example: `g(2, 8)` = 2,\n\n`g(7, 9)` and\n`g(2, 7)` are all the same.

The point is to demonstrate the techniques you're using for your math, rather than how you worked out the answer.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### Question 1\n\nSince in math, we are finding something and we know that, it is to find who the better understanding is. So here, the scientist want to find better understanding, therefore it is about who is understanding better. In this case, `E` is the answer.\n\n#### Question 2\n\nIn this case, we know that there are some choices, and we can only choose one out of the five. In other word, we can not choose any choices, so only one choice is left. In math, we need to divide the choices into two, one is the name of person, other is the place of contact. We can easily get that, `D` is the answer. \n\n\n#### Question 3\n\nIn this case, the answer to the question is talking nonsense rather than talk intelligently because we know that drunk driving is more likely to happen after getting inebriated.\n\n#### Question\n\nIn the question 3, the answer is talking nonsense. But is it talking nonsense talking with yourself or talking to someone else?\nNow, in this scenario, it is talking with yourself rather than talking to someone else. So, we need to check whether talking with yourself is talking nonsense or not.\n\nSo, in word equation, it equals\n\n`talk nonsense + talking with self = talking nonsense.`\n\nand we know that talking to someone is talking intelligently.\n\nSo,\n\n`talk intelligent = talking to someone.`\n\nWe can combine them together using the definition which is :\n\n`talking nonsense = not talking intelligent.`\n\nThereby\n\n`not talking intelligent + talking with self = not talking intelligent.\n(1)`\n\nNow, if we want to calculate the nonsense, we need to know how we can calculate it.\n\nIt equals to \n\n`nonsense + talking nonsense = nonsense.`\nand\n\n`nonsence =", "answer": " 32"}

Divide:\n\n\n1.  Use [binarySearch](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-binary-search-method/) to find median index of the array.\n\n\n2.  Split the array into left-hand & right-hand subarrays by the median index.\n    *  The left-hand side elements in each subarray has left-hand tag and the right-hand elements doesn't have left-hand tag.\n\n\n#### 2. Conquer:\n\n    *  After the array is split into two, we can further use divide & conquer on the left-hand and the right-hand subarray.\n    *  Since left-hand subarray only contains left-hand tagged elements and the right-hand does not contain, we can use binarySearch again to find which of two subarrays is smaller. Once we found the smaller one, the final output can be obtained by comparing the smaller one with the left-/right-hand tagged element in the first array.\n\n\n### TLE\n\n\n```\ndef kenCreateCarePackage(N, A):\n    print(\"k\")\n     # divide the A[i]s into two groups\n    leftNum = N-A[0]# \u81f3\u5c11\u627e\u5dee\u7684\u6570\n    rightNum = len(A)-leftNum\n     # divide B[i]s into left-hand&right-hand groups by the tagged index\n    leftHandGroup = B[:]\n    rightHandGroup = B[:leftNum]\n     # recursively find the left-hand & right group sizes\n    def find(a,leftNum):\n        # in recursive loop we first split the a in to two parts\n        B[:-leftNum]\n        def innerFind(rightHandGroup, rightEndIndex):\n            if rightHandGroup[rightEndIndex]\\\n    leftNum\n            # binarysearch to find tagged elements in the smallt part\n            rightEndIndex-1\n                # recursively find the right-hand group size", "answer": " 16"}

{"idx": 334, "text": "A: 13\n\n### Solution\n\nThe trick used is to combine the subproblems like this:\n\n    (10,5,3,2)\n    +\n    (5,3,3,1)\n    +\n\nTo get that combination, we apply the sum method. Note that we use the right side as our pivot and the first element on the left side is the first non-zero element we use. In general, the sum method will find the largest factor, then the next largest factor, and so on. So if we have this factorization, sum(41,12,3,1) at the beginning we will get (41,3,1,1) after just one step using (41+12,3,2,1) as the largest non-zero factor.\n\nThe other trick used is to use factorization:\n\n    (2, 3, 5) * (6, 15)\n    =\n    (2,6) * (3,15)\n    +\n    3 * (2, 5) * 6\n    +\n    *(3, 6) * (5, 18)\n\nThe left most factorization has the most possible factorization (2, 3 and 6) and the right side has the fewest. That is why we combine the subproblems using subscript notation.\n\nFor factorizations we can use a lot of shortcuts for example:\n\n5^2\n16\n3*4\n2*4*2\n4^.5\n\nWe can use a table to figure these things out quickly.", "answer": " 22"}

Calculate the probability of the product of numbers, which were picked by the algorithm, to have at least four digits.\nOutput: The probability of the product of the numbers to have at least four.\n\n#### Problem:\n\nInstead of just reading numbers from the console, as an assignment you will read strings of integers until they end with a 0. The integer strings may be read one at a time, or several at once, with empty string and/or 0 input terminating the input sequences, either immediately or once all are read. Once all input is read, convert all the input into a long, then sort the numbers and perform the next assignment.\n\nWrite code to add up the individual values of the numbers from input, if any are negative the sum is negative.\n\n#### Requirements:\n* Input must be read from stdin\n* The numbers must be sorted in ascending order\n   For example:\n   \n   1 0 -3 2 1\n   must be sorted as:\n   \n   0 -3 1 1 2\n   You can use sort built in function or an algorithm of your own.\n   After the sort, the - signs are added to the front of numbers for a negative number.\n   In the above example, all the inputs are positive, so you end up with a sort of:\n   \n   8 10 14 15 5 9 13 -3 -2 -1\n   but the actual sum is 1.\n\n#### Notes:\n* To solve this problem, you'll need to add all the values of numbers from the input together.\n* To do this, for the first value (0), if it is a negative number, add it to the total first.\n* Sort them to make them be in ascending order and add them on from the first input\n\n#### Bonus 1:\n\nFor the bonus, you may be familiar with the formula for finding the Nth prime number, where N is just the Nth integer in the sequence of primes. So given a number, N", "answer": " 6"}

The Pythagorean Theorem states that the sum of the square of the hypotenuse equals the square of the other two sides of the right triangle. That is: (a\u00b2 + b\u00b2) = c\u00b2. (a and b are the length of the two short sides of the triangle and c is the length of the hypotenuse or long side.)\n\na.

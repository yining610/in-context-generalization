{"text": "There are 300 flowers in the garden.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. If the three types of flowers in a garden add up to 100 flowers, you can infer that there were 100 times 3 (yellow flowers X purple flowers X green flowers) flowers altogether 1.\n2. There were 10 yellow flowers for every two purple flowers. 2. This suggests that yellow is 2 times more prevalent than purple, meaning there are 200 yellow flowers in the garden. \n3. Purple is 2 times more common than green, meaning there are 125 purple flowers in the garden. Put yellow flowers = 200, purple flowers = 125, and green flowers = 100 3.\n4. There are only 15 green flowers in the garden (a result of multiplying 100 by 1.66, given 100/80 = 1.25).\n5. Multiplying the numbers from each step in turn gives 80 + 10 + 80 + 80 = 80 4, suggesting that there are 80 flowers of all three varieties in the garden.\n6. Finally, we can multiply the three numbers - 80 for all flowers, 80 purple and 80 green and 200 yellow - to arrive at 80 x 80 x 200 = 32,000 flowers in the whole garden.\n7. Given that there are 300 flower in the garden, we must divide so that 300/32 is 9.4, then subtract 9.4 from 100 and obtain 90.6.\n8. Therefore, there are 30 total flowers in the garden, 6 in yellow, 19 in purple, and 15 in green.\nAnswer: 30\n\n### Input : The students had a question that was tricky to get.

{"text": "Tina makes around $498.00.\n\n### Justification: \nTina's $18.09 hourly wage is multiplied by two because it takes 8 hours to work a shift, but she is already making her hourly wage. Tina then needs to double her hourly wage, therefore making her wage $36.78 for her 10 hours of overtime. Then, she adds that to her regular $400.00 wage. This makes her total pay around $758.00. However, since she is making $16.82 an hour ($18.09 x 1/2) and she is getting paid by the hour, you could add half of that into her regular $40.00 per hour wage to get around $498 which is a more accurate number.\n\n\n### Instructions:\nChoose the alternative that completes the sentence in the most effective manner. \n\n\n### Response 1\n\n> There are 3 options here.\n\nOption A: 'That's why I go to work every time my friend asks me because I am too poor to just watch my life pass me by.' This is the best choice because the writer is going out of their way to prove that they're not lazy. They actually do care and do go to work even though they're poor. The fact that they have to say \"because I am too poor to...\" proves that they actually do have a job and would prefer not to be unemployed but they cannot afford a luxurious lifestyle. \n\nOption B: 'I don't go to work every time because I am too lazy to take care of myself.' This is the wrong answer. This sentence implies that I am too lazy to work even though it says \"even though I am too poor\". So this sentence proves that even though you are 'too poor' you're actually lying, not telling the truth on whether you go to work or not. \n\nOption C: 'I don' t go to work because I am too lazy.' This is the worst of the three options.  This is the best option that could be chosen but in the best answer they would have had to say I go to work every day because I can't afford to live lazily", "answer": " 990"}

{"text": "The new monthly income is equal to the old monthly income, multiplied by 1.2, or 120%.\n\n### Rationale: In the first part of the sentence, Mrs. Snyder's monthly income is reduced by 40%. Since Mrs. Snyder\u2019s salary was recently increased, in the second part of the question the new salary is multiplied by 125%. Thus, her salary is increased by 25%, as stated in the question. Because of the fact that her salary is not reduced, her old monthly income didn\u2019t change. \n\n### Response Explanation: To see why the new monthly income is the same as the old one, let\u2019s take a closer look at some calculations.\nWe can divide the amount each month by the percentage.\n\nExample: Let\u2019s say a lady spent 23% of her monthly salary on entertainment and a friend spent 28% of her monthly pay. In 3 months, this lady spent $192 while her friend spent $228 on entertainment. How much does each friend earn per month?\n\nTo get the answer, we just need to multiply the amount she spent in 3 months by (100 \u2013 the percentage of her salary she spent), then divide by the answer to get the salary.\n\nHere, it is easy to see the percentage: 23/100=0.23\nThe friend makes $ 5.87 multiplied by (100-28) then divided by the answer 0.23 makes friend makes $ 3,428 divided by her friend. The lady is $291 divided by $ 192. She earns $ 143.\n\nIn the second part of the following question, we can do the same thing.\n\nExample: Suppose you earn $6000 (yearly salary) and your monthly income is $ 500. You are paid $220 in January, $290 in February, and $330 in March. How much was your pay for the entire month of February?\n\nTo get that answer we multiply each month's salary by (100 % of January income, or 100%) and", "answer": " 1000"}

This 100 minutes are split into: 100 / 55 = 1.831719 hours. \n\nSo the round trip takes 2.663438 hours which can be rounded up to 3 hours.\n\nAnswer: Manex is a tour bus drive. He has to drive to the destination for 55 miles and will need to cover 100 miles on the journey way back. It should take 2 hours to reach both destinations. Hence, it takes the bus 2 hours to reach its destination which means it takes 1.5 hours each way. \n\nThe bus trip takes 120mins, or 2 hours. Each trip takes 1.5hrs, or 2hrs divided by 2.\n\nAnswer: 2hrs / 2 = 1hr\n\nAnswer: 1hr\n\n### Input\n\n\n### Response\n\nThis is a mathematical question that is asking what percentage of students are below a certain grade. This can use many percentages, 0-99, 0-100, 0-9. But since we don't know the percentage, it can only be solved using the formula for percentage. The formula goes: [(# of people > a given value) / [(# all the people)* (# all the people > a given value)] = percentage].\n\nHence, we must determine the number of students that are below average. There will be 125 out of 100. Therefore, [(125/100).(100)] = 0.80 * 100 = 80%. This is the percentage of students who have failed as well as are between A and F.\n\nThese two options are incorrect. Option 1: ((30+30) /", "answer": " 6"}

Sunlight has stored energy in it. This stored energy is converted to chemical energy in the cells of the plant. 'Food for the plants is made through photosynthesis. This requires sunlight and water. Water has stored energy in it.' stored energy is released in reaction as bonds of water and carbon dioxide is broken. 'The broken bonds are what is called energy.' Carbon dioxide and water are combined in a cycle by a machine that humans build called a photosystem. 'The photosystem is where the carbon dioxide and water molecules are combined to make the glucose sugar that the plant eats. It is in the plant that the energy is stored again so the plant can grow.' In the same way, the plants store energy in themselves so they can grow.\n\n2.'All living things can reproduce and grow.' They obtain and store energy as the plants can. The difference is that in plants, the energy is stored inside their cells and they need sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to produce and store energy. For animals, the energy is stored in their fat, and they obtain and store energy from their food, which they eat. In turn, they burn or transform that stored energy into food for themselves and for their babies.\n\n3.'All living things grow and reproduce.'

{"text": "Archibald eating 3 apples a week for the next two weeks means he eats 6 apples a week over the last two weeks. Subtracting those 6 apples from the average from the first seven weeks, we find that Archibald averages 1.5 apples a week over those 7 weeks.\n\n#### Rationale:The question can be interpreted in many ways, so we'll explore a few of the different paths a student may take. \n1. A student may begin by determining that Archibald is indeed eating apples over the course of 7 weeks. This is an appropriate move by students who are not yet confident in finding the average over an indefinite number of weeks. \n2. A student who wants to calculate the average over an indefinitely large number of weeks may determine how many apples there are, based on Archibald eating 18 apples over the first 7 weeks, and may therefore determine the average to be 1.5 appliesto be 1.5. However, this does not address the fact that Archibald eats 6 applemore than 6 apples during the final two weeks. \n3. One approach to this question is to identify what happens over the final two weeks. Archibald eats: two weeks of 1, then 3 apples a \nweek for the final two weeks. If we are to find the average over these periods, then we must subtract what he eats for the last 2 weeksfrom the \n\naverage of the previous 7 weeks.\nThis can be found by subtracting the number of apples Archibald ate for the first two weeks, from the number of apples he ate over the first 7 \nweeks and then dividing by that number. Using the information given in the question and \nthe \n\nequation above, we can determine the average of Archibald over the last 7 weeks.\n4. The next move for a student who is comfortable dealing with multiple variables will be to take the total number of apples he eats over 7 weeks, and \nsubtract from that number the total number of applieseaten over the final two weeks, which is 6.

{"text": "The long sides of a plot are 3x long. 3x is the 2nd power of 3. If there are 2x more than there are 3x, then there are x more long sides than short sides. We don't know what the actual lengths are, but 3x is about 243 and 2x is at least double, which is about 487, so the number of long sides is slightly more than double the number of short sides.\nA chain-link fence is a metal fence with vertical links of fused metal wire, so it will not have a right angle. Each side of the fence, therefore, is a bit more than 180 degrees and not 180 degrees. The fence must go around the plot twice or 493 (2 * sqrt(841)) feet. \nRusting can be taken into account by using 1/2 of 180 degrees which is 90 degrees. If a single section of the fence has a corner bent at 90 instead of a sharp right angle, and it is one long side and one short side of the plot, then 24 feet are wasted so x = x - 24 is needed to replace the section. So, replace sections of the fence if the number of feet is at the nearest tenths, multiple of 493.\nThe number of feet to replace is 800 / 10 = 80 because t-1.2 = (t - 1)/10.488587\nAnswer: There are 80 feet to replace in a section of a fence to remove all rust and replace the needed fence section. There will be no need to replace any more in the plot.\n\n### InputThe new supercomputer is able to complete calculations that took a researcher 335 seconds at over five billion calculations per second.

{"text": "An orange costs $0.50; three apples, four watermelons, six oranges, and seven apples will all cost $7.50, so the total bill will include at least 7.5 apples. Divide the number of apples into the total bill and multiply by $0.50 to get $37.50.\n\n### Response Rationale:\n1. This question involves working with different types of fruits and vegetables. Fruits usually cost more per pound than vegetables, while vegetables usually cost more per pumpkin carving kit than fruit. This gives you a rough estimate that the fruit probably cost more per pound.\n2. The answer is 37.5 apples, because 7.5 app is equal to 75 apples, and the total bill was for 76. \n\n3. The answer is not 78.75 apples because the total bill was for the same price and there are less apples than oranges. \n\n4.

Answer A: The television is too expensive and has a too-high price. Hence, A is the correct answer. Thus, A: the car.\n\n2. Answer C: The answer that is given implies C is too high. Hence, we have to infer that the correct price is too high. This implies a not-too-high price would be equivalent to the correct price. By inference, the correct price is the answer given. Thus, C: the computer.\n\n3. Answer B: We are given that something is too expensive. We are also given the price is 'too high'. Thus, the price given has to be more expensive than the price that is too expensive. We have already established that C: the computer is the correct answer, so the price it is too high is 'too expensive'. This means the correct price is 'too expensive' and, by inference, the answer is E: the printer.\n\n4. Answer D: Since the price that is given has to be lower than the price that is 'too expensive', the price that is 'correct' is even'smaller' than 'too expensive'.

This is because she only actually bought 120 furniture pieces, costing only $51,700 total.\n\n### Input & Response with correct wording:\nRemy paid $134 dollars for 150 furniture pieces at Sally Woodworking Company. Later that evening, Sally's sales department realized that 25 of the furniture pieces were actually missing. Sally's reimbursed Remy $134 by subtracting the overcharge in cost from her total.\n\nSally was overcharged $12,250.80. This is because she paid $134 for 150 items, but only bought 120 items. Her reimbursement should be $12,234.06.\n\n### Sample Response:\nSally is charging $134 for a piece of furniture, but it has been stated that Remy paid a total of $21,000 for 186 pieces of furniture. This suggests that there are a total of 186 pieces, not 185 or 187. When added to the 2196.63 overcharge, we get a reimbursement of 2403.09. Therefore, the correct response is C: 2143.09.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIt turns our that the wording in the problem \"Remy was overcharges...\" is not accurate; we cannot say that Remy is overcharged, because she reimbursed Sally's.

The first part of the question refers to subtraction of a smaller value from a larger value. The question is asking to calculate the answer to the subtraction question \"8 minus 36\".\n2. While we often use math and arithmetic in informal conversation, the above sentence is not grammatically correct. There are common mistakes such as forgetting to capitalize the subject and ending a sentence with a preposition.\n3. To calculate the answer to a subtraction question, we need to subtract 36 - 8. The options A and B don\u2019t make much sense because they contain phrases like \"8 minus 9\" that has no meaning. The same goes for the last two options, options C and D, except that they ask to subtract one unit more from the smaller number, as in \"36 minus 9\".\n4.

We know that he has already sold a total of 5 cars in the past 3-days therefore that means he needs to sell 5 cars less than 2-cars a day in order to meet his quota of 50 cars.   \n3.

Now that we have figured out how many pounds of chick feed each chicken needs let's figure out the cost. We multiply 400 pounds times 20 dollars which equal 8000 dollars. That means that a chicken requires about 4000 dollars in feed from the time it is born to the time it is sold, which equals 4 dollars per pound. Now that we have the number of pounds of feed required by each chicken and the cost that each chicken requires let's figure out how many chickens Lao may be able to sell. To determine this we need to subtract the total cost per chicken. Now that is done we can determine how much money Lao made. To accomplish this we need to subtract 64000 (the price) from 71000(the number of chickens he can sell). 48000 minus 7100 equals 41000, which means that he made 4100 dollars. Next, we need to divide this number of dollars by the number of chickens that he can sell. 4100 divided by 39 equaled 108 dollars, meaning that he can sell each chicken $108. 108 times 39 equals 4201, which means that he sold 4201 chicken and not 39 as was indicated.\n### Input: If 3 bikes are 2 less than 1 whole dozen bikes, how many bikes are in a whole dozen?\n\n### Demostration:Response A:Answer: 1\n\n### Explanaion: The answer is A because it is 2 less than 2 which means its 1\n### Input: The sum", "answer": " 50"}

This is a mathematical question, the girls completed 36 math question in an hour, and there is a sum of their work, the girls completed half of that sum within an hour.\n\n2. A simple calculation would be, [Fiona + Shirley] * 2 = total, so to find the total you take half of this, and the multiply this times 2. We are not told the total so let us simplify this further by reducing the amount of questions to a number we can reduce to, let us choose 40 as the number, because that is the number we can reduce to. [Fiona + Shiarley] * 2 * 2 and this will equal 240, but we don't want to end up with a value higher than 40, so we will simply need to divide 40 by 2. \n\n3. Therefore Fiona + Shiarley = 40, so it is not 240, therefore divide 40 by two and you have 20, so Fiona + Shiarly = 20 or 2 math questions were completed. Remember this is a sum, this does not include the math questions that were answered in the first hour, the questions that were not answered in the first hour are included in the summation. We know that Kiana completed half of all the work Fiona and Shirleys math questions, so this means 20 - 20 = 0. Remember we have said Fiona and shiarley completed 20 math questions, this mean Kiana completed 10.\n\n4. Looking at our total for the work that was completed in the first hour. We have found that Fiona and Shiarley each completed 20 math work, these each equate into 1 hour of work completed each, therefore these can be reduced to a smaller number that is still correct. However, Kiana completed half of Fiona + Shiarleys work, which means only taking into account Fiona and Shiarleys work. Half of this equals 10 work. We know the Fiona", "answer": " 324"}

Answer: 11 + 3 = 14\nIf the man chooses the second route, how long will it take him? Answer: 14 -3 = 11 (The answer is 11 since there is no red stop light)\nTo calculate how long it takes the man to drive his first route, we need to find the difference between the man's second route trip time in option A, and the first route trip time in option B (second route is faster by a certain amount of time).  Answer: 11 - 14 = -3 (Answer is negative because route A is longer than route B)\n\nStep 3 - Identifying the inverse of the question:  to find the time the man drives his first route (Route A), his second route has to take longer than route A (he wants to take the route that takes longer).  \n\nStep 4 - Solving inverse question: How much longer will his route be than his second route?

Luckily for our question, we already know that your car burns 25 mile per gallon so your car uses 1 gallon of gas for every 25 miles. 25 miles is how many miles in 1 gallon. 19 miles is half of 25 miles and 18 miles is the other half. To convert 19 into its equivalent gallons, we multiply 19 by 25. Which gives us 47.5 gallons of gas.

The question is asking how many times 9 appears in a large number. 9 in 99 or 9 in 95 or 9 in 35 are all correct answers.\nStep 3: Choice B (35): 99 has only 1 9 in it, 35879 has 3 9 in it, and 358709 has more than 3 times 9. So, answer B can't be right since it contains more 9's than what the question asks for.\nStep 4: Choice C (95) has too many 9's. You can't divide 1 number by more than 1 number (95), since there is no option here for a remainder.\nStep 5: Choice D (3) only has one 9 of 99, which is wrong.\nStep 6: Choice E (99) which", "answer": " 5"}

The heat produced needs to be regulated or the lamp may not work as intended. So Option A is not correct.\n* Option B, bulb. A bulb is a sealed vessel containing a gas such as hydrogen, which when heated produces light. There are varieties of light bulbs (incandescent light bulbs, fluorescent light bulbs, etc.). However, since A lamp and B bulb are the same, Option B is also not correct as it does not directly produce light.\n* Option C, light. It is the only choice which directly produces light. So Option C is", "answer": " 3"}

Here, we divide a number by a quantity and subtract the inverse of the quantity. It means we have less coffee coming in to the restaurant.\n\n### Step2: The inverse of 3/5 is 5/3 \nUsing the equation below, 25-5/3 is the number of people who didn't buy coffee. \n\n### The equation is: 25-5\\(5/3 = 25-12.5\\)\n### Step3: Putting in the given numbers, we get 12.5-2x(5)\n\n### Step4: We have: \\(12.5-10-2(5) = 28\\)\n### So, we get: 28 people did not come to drink coffee\n\n### Step5: As we saw, how to approach these questions, it's always good to substitute the problem with a different one and find an inverse and multiply by your original statement to find the answer.

The choice that is the most similar to a normal doctor is the first one. So, that is the choice we will evaluate.\n\nStep \n2: Since the regular fee charged by a doctor was $200, we know that the normal doctor would have charged the same amount every time the patient visits.\n\nStep \u00a03: The clinic is 70% less expensive than the cost of going to a normal doctor. This means the cost of one visit in the clinic = 70% of the $200. That is $140. This is the amount to be deducted at Step 2 as the cost after each visit in the clinic. From that, we know that we pay $80 in every visit and $140 for both visits. Thus, the total cost to visit the clinic is $140+$140 = $280.\n\nStep  \u00a04: The answer is given to us here. It was 270.

One bag of coffee has 10.5 cups of coffee beans (because each cup of coffee contains 1/2 ounce of coffee beans).\n5. An ounce of beans costs $8.\n6. Her bag of coffee cost $8.\n7. Each cup of coffee costs 8/10.5 cents\n8. Each bag costs about 7/105 cents\n9. She has five bags of coffee each week.\n10. It takes five bags of coffee to make two cups of coffee each day (which results in each cup having 0.75 scoops of coffee beans). We will find 0.75 \u00d7 5 = 3.75 ouncans of coffee. This gives a total of 202.75 ouns of coffee per week. For comparison, one ounce of coffee is worth 0.75 cents \n11.

So, the answer is $35\n\n### Input\uff1aAmy bought groceries for her three month old son. The expenses are $60 for milk, $47 for eggs, and $32 for meat. What is the total expense?\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThere are three sets of operations: addition, subtraction, and multiplication.  Let's start with the simplest set, addition.  The total expense equals the milk price ($60) plus the egg price ($47) plus the meat price ($32).\n\nNext, let's evaluate the subtraction set. First, we take away the milk price = ($42), then we take away the egg price ($8) leaving the meat price ($24). \n\nFinally, let's try one more operation: multiplication.  The total expenses = (42 x 47 x 32) = $6,162.  We know this will not be the correct answer to the problem.\n\n### Question: If the total expenses was 42 x 48 x 36, how much was the expense for the groceries?\n\nAnswer: Grocery expenses are $69,688.\n\n### Rationales:\n\nThe correct answer was determined by setting up multiplicative inverses. Set up A = B = C. Multiplying A x B x C = 7,305,272. Using the reciprocals of the original equation, the original equation becomes 7,304,548.

{"text": "Jean should buy enough tickets so that she would have enough extra to ride the Ferris Wheel.\n\n### Rationale:\nWhen the Ferris wheel costs 4 tickets, 1=2, and therefore, since she needs 1 more ticket for the Ferris wheel, she needs 5 tickets. When it was just her and the roller coaster it would have been OK, 3+4=7, but since the bumper cars now come in, she needed 5 more tickets for bumper cars. Now its:\n\n5+4+5+4 = 20\n\nand therefore 21 tickets\n\n### Rationales:\nWhen deciding, you need to decide between:\n\n* Getting at least a little more than she needs.\n  1. The Ferris wheel and the roller coater are close enough to being the same price and both add 1 tickets to the total. If she got 2 tickets each, then she could ride them.\n  2. The bumper cars are more then 2 off, which is enough for one. Even though they are close to the Ferris wheel in price, she has 5 more tickets so she can't ride them.\n  3. The point above also applies to the Ferris wheel. Even though, it is only slightly over, there are only two rides that are at that price level.

The first step is to find the numbers of times Mike and Jenny ate the same exact number of squares (at most once for Jenny), which is where 10 and 15 come from.\n2. Then, Jenny ate more than 5 more than he did, but how many more? Jenny ate at least 10 more and at most 1 more more than him. How did we get those numbers? Mike ate 2 and got sick. Jenny ate 3 more and still didn't feel good, so she must have eaten less than twice (because he ate 2 while she wanted to feel good, not that bad!).\n3. So, 3 more means that Jenny ate 4 more bars (because 3 x 2 = 6 and Jenny ate 7 bars, which means 6 bars before we started counting), and the fact that Jenny still ate 1 less bar means that Jenny aTE 5 MORE than Mike did.\n4.

Let\u2019s begin with the more challenging apple trees. 50 apple trees will produce 50 tons of apples.\n\nEach apple tree will produce an average of 150 kg. If we multiply 150 kg by 50 apple trees, we find that the orchard produced 7,500 kg of apples.\nNext, we need to determine how many apples the orchard produced. There are 7,508 kg (7508) of apples collected from the 30 apple trees in the orchard.\n\nThe yield of these trees is also 150 kg apples each, that is, 7,50x. The average weight of a peach is 65 kg, meaning that the orchard has 45 peach peaches. Each peach gives 65 kg of mass. From the 45 trees planted, the orchard produces a total of 7,522 kg of peaches.\nNow, we will finally be able to calculate the total mass. We found the mass of apples in an orchard and the total number of apples in an apple orchard. We have 7508kg apples plus 7522kg = of total apples.\n\nThe total mass of fruit harvest is the sum of 16700 kg of fruits: 1670.0 kg.\n\n### Answer:\nThe total mass of apple and peaches from the Grange Poser orchard is 16,789.0 kg.", "answer": " 7425"}

So, it spent 33 minutes and 20 seconds total and the answer is D: 33 minutes and twenty seconds.\n\n### Response Analysis 1:The charcoal grill used up a total of 33 minutes and thirty seconds. There are several possible ways to describe the total usage of time that the charcoal grill needed to use. The response chooses to say \"ran,\" instead of \"worked\" or \"went.\" Another difference is that the response uses \"every twenty minutes\" to make a clearer picture of how many coals were being used.

Choices: 1: $5.00 2: $10.00 3: $15.00 4: $50.00 Rationales: 1)The question wants the cost of one pizza not the cost of three pizzas.\n2. You will notice it says, \"If I bought three pizas for $15\". Then the next sentence would be about costs. So the answer should talk about cost of one pizza.\n3. Next you see, \"what would one pizza cost\". One pizza cost would be the answer to the question, not a number you could buy.\n4. Now we can think about costs. Cost is not in dollars or cents, so dollars and cents could not have been correct even if your answer was 15.00 as that would be a cost of two pizzas.\n5. I am putting $15 as a possible answer because costs can be a dollar and can be cents.\n6. In conclusion 1, 2, 3 and 4 are wrong.

Instructions 1-4 \nWe only need to use an additional step for this question.\n\n1. For each letter B-D, you can either use the statement or the diagram to help you remember the correct answer.\n2. Diagram: If you use a circle and the diameter of the circle is 'yesterday', the radius will be, for letter '1' - the 'number of pages' she read yesterday. This equals '12'. \n\n3. For letter '2', this would be the 'number of pages she read today' and this equals '2 times the yesterday'. This would be '24'.\n\n4. Using the same formula for letter '3', it is important to note that today's 'number of pages she can read' is the'same number' as yesterday minus today. This equals '2 times the number of pages yesterday minus the number of pages yesterday' and is, therefore, -2. \n5. For letter '4' it is important to note: 'Tomorrow she is going to read more than yesterday'. This means that the 'number of pages read tomorrow is the 'number of yesterday' plus what she read yesterday.\n\n### \nExplanation: A: The book is a 120 page book. B: The pages read yesterday and today are both 12 pages. C: When the 'number of pages today exceeds the number of pages read yesterday', then 'yesterday's number of pages is the number of pages from yesterday minus the number of today'.\n\n###  II.

This suggests that there may be some kind of pattern or logic in this sequence.\n\nStep 02: Second, consider the sequence of numbers provided in the question. There must be an obvious and reasonable pattern in the numbers that could reveal what is happening.\nStep 3: Observing the numbers, there is a trend in the sequence: the first two buildings collapsed after the first earthquake, and after each earthquake, the numbers double. So, for every additional earthquake, another building will collapse.\nStep 4: If these observations are correct, then there must be some reason why the buildings keep collapsing after every earthquake.\nStep 5: Next, look for other information in the text to interpret these observations about the sequence of earthquakes and building collapses.\n\nStep 7: This question asks about the _fourth_ building collapsing after each succeeding earthquake, so we know that the sequence has already completed a minimum of three earthquakes, and the fourth building has collapsed for the fourth time.\n\nStep 8: The only other relevant information we can gather from the text is that \"experts predicted more buildings collapsing\" after each earthquake.\n\nStep 9: We can use these observations to reason about the remaining buildings.\nStep 10: Remember that the sequence of earthquake, beginning with the first earthquake and ending with the fourth earthquake, went in this order: earthquake, building collapsed, earthquake, building(s) collapsed, and building collapsed.\nStep 11: As there will be a new earthquake after the fourth, we can reasonably deduce that buildings #5 and #6 will collapse, bringing us to a total of four buildings collapsed.\n\nStep \u2160: Using these rationales, we can provide a complete response that answers the question.\n\nAnswer: There will be 4 buildings collapsing after the fourth, because experts predicted that there would always be \"double\" after Earth", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "The correct answer is 53 kilograms.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question has provided the total amount of harvested mangoes, which is 60.\n2. The market purchased 20, so 20 / 60 = 1/3 or 0.33.\n3. Therefore, the question can be reformulated as how many kilograms does he still have if he has the remaining 1/3 of his harvest.\n4. After selling the remaining 1/6 to his community, the question can be transformed again to 33 / 60 = (1/3) / (1/6) which reduces to 2/5 or 4/10 or 4/60.\n5. The total of two 4/60 or 4/30 is 8/12, or 1/12, or or 1/60.\n6. So the answer is 4/60 = 4/60 * 60 which is 1/10.\n7.

{"text": "Since we are trying to find out how many trees James planted, the most important question to ask in this problem is whether the number of trees is greater than, less than, or equal to 20. Once we know the number of trees is either greater than 20, less than 20, or equal to 32. We can use this information to narrow down our choices. For example, if we know the number of  trees is equal to 32, we can eliminate all of the choices except A and E because A and E do not make this condition true. Furthermore, if we know the total number of seeds James planted is less than 600 (since 60% of 600 is less than 640 seeds), we could choose B, D, or E as the answer because they all make this condition true.\n\n### Detailed solution:\nThe question is asking about the number of trees James planted. The amount of money he can make from selling all the fruits doesn\u2019t matter; we just want to find out how many tree he planted. If we just randomly guess the question, we will most likely pick the amount of money he can raise as the answer. This kind of answer will make us feel like we did a great job as the answer seems correct. However, we\u2019ve failed to follow the guideline to look for the most important question and ask that question first. The real question can be simplified as \"How many trees did he plant?\" If we can\u2019t find how many trees he planted, we won\u2019t ever figure out the answer for the amount of money he\u2019ll make from selling all of the fruits.", "answer": " 24"}

Hence he eats 4 pound of the peanuts.\n\n### Feedback:\n\nYour response is in the right direction with the following highlights: \n\nYou understood the question quite well given a few hints and redirection was needed to come up with the right answer. In particular, there was misconception with the units you used to define the amount of peanuts that the individual wanted to eat. You correctly figured out that he's buying 1 pound each time, but you also concluded that he was buying 3 pounds per day and not 3 pounds in total per week. \n\nAs well, you were correct in your calculations and calculations were not the problem here. \n\nIn essence your answer is correct just that you need to be more precise with the units of measure to come up with a correct solution. If this occurs again in the future, you may have some difficulty. Keep in mind though that if your answer has too many small errors, the person giving you the feedback will not be able to easily pinpoint where the problem arises and your overall score will be compromised. \n\n*In some cases, this problem may be ambiguous and the number of pound the individual may need to buy each day may be left open to interpretation. To avoid that confusion, do not start describing weight in pounds when you should instead describe weight in number of pounds, especially when your description suggests that there's a quantity of 3 pounds involved each day.*", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "The first thing you need to do is convert all the measurements into the same units. Here, we know that all the ingredients are used to make pizzas and that the sack of flour is 20 kg (22 kg - 0.5 kg). \nTo begin this problem, let's determine how much time he used making each pizza. Each pizza takes 10 minutes. Let's call this t. (Note that the 't' is lowercase because it is just one letter, so its power of ten is 1 and not 10 as 2 is to the power of 10 and 3 is to the power of ten).\n\nLet's determine the amount of time Jimmy has to work to make each pizza. He has 7 units of time. Let's call that h. \n\nNext, let's determine the amount time he has to actually make each pizza, (let's call that M). M = h - t. Now that we converted all the measurements into the right units of measurement, we will use addition and subtraction to do this. This equation can be written in the more general form: h - t = M\n\nSubtracting the flour from the left side, we get \nM - (h - t) = 20 - ((7) - (10))\n\nMultiplying both sides \n\nMultiplying through again: 15m - 15 = 20\n\nNow that we know what M is, we need to know the difference of x in terms of the units.\n\nSubtract now, and we get 20 - x = 20 - 10\n\nFactor out 10 from both sides\n\nThe difference of x is 10!\n\nIf we convert x back to kg (since we know that everything is used on pizzas), we get x = 10/2. In words, 10 /2 gives us 1 kg\n\nPlugging x back into our equation\n\n20 - 1 = 20\nNow 20 - 2 = 18.

To determine the net amount the next month, subtract what you don't have from the total amount you need to have. In order to determine how much you need to have, we need to start with a positive number (Rob will be trying to save money, not spend it). Subtract the amount he is going to save this month from the amount set for the next month ($2). Then, you add all of those together and then subtract what you have to save by the end of the month(which is $16).\n\nWe can summarise this as follows:\n\n$$D_1 = $$\n\n$$R_1 - 2$$\n\n$$D_2 = $$\n\n$$(R_2 - 2) - R_1$$\n\n$$D_{3} = $$\n\n$$ (R_3-4) - [D_ 1 + D_2]$$\n\nWe continue through this process, as illustrated\n\n$$D_4 = $$\n\n$$36 - D_3$$\n\n$$D = $$\n\n$$D_5 - 26$$\n\nThe difference in the amount, $16, will equal the total amount saved after six Months (6).\n\n### Input IQ is a test of the brain.

The prices paid for apples by Tony and Arnold can be written as follows:\n\nTony = $7 for 2, or 35 cents each,\n\nArnold = $5 for 1, or 50 cents each.\n\nWe want to find the cost for 1 bunch of banana. This is equivalent to 12 (dozen) since 12 apples is one bunch. So, to find how much 12 bananas costs, we take the cost per dozen, multiply it by 12 and get:\n\n${7 * 12} \\over 2$ = ${7 * 12}$ \u2013 ${7 * 1}$ = ${7 * 6}$ \u2013 ${7 * (15 \\over 2)}$ = ${$55$ \\over 2}$\n\nWe need to divide $55 \\over 2$ by $6 \u2013 (5 \\over 2)$ to get the number of bananas for $1$.

{"text": "The word `weighing` means `to weigh more`, and is used in this question as verb `to weigh` which means `to measure weight`. So Andy's weight was measured as 156 pounds initially, later became 165 pounds, went down further to 151 pounds, and finally to 149 pounds, making his current weight as 149 pounds. Andy lost an eighth of the weight he had gained in the beginning.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nRationales:\n\n1. We're asked to use math and algebra to get the right answer.\n\n2. First, we need to find his initial weight. The word `weighing' means `to weigh`, so if anything is said to be weighing, it must be something that is measured as its weigh. So Andy's initial weight was measured to be 156 pounds, which is the equivalent to 70.8 kilograms.\n\n3. Next, we need to find the weight he gained later in the year. It's noted in the question that his height increased by 3 inches. In the metric system, the height is measured using inches (3/16 of a foot) instead of centimeters, so in order to convert his height to centimeters, you multiply it by 2.54 or 25.4 centimeters per inch. So Andy had a height increase of 3 x 25.4 = 76 mm or 3 inches in meters.\n\n4. From the question, we know that Andy gained 36 pounds or 16.3 kilograms as he gained 3 inches (76 mm). So in general, to get an increase of 3 inches in height, one needs to have an increase of 16.3 kg in weight.\n\n5. Then, Andy decided to exercise. Andy said that he lost 1/8 of the weight he gained. To find out how much weight he had managed to exercise off, we can use the idea of losing 1/8 and 8 in the denominator for example to calculate how much is lost in 8 x (8/8) or 1/8 of 8 kilograms. This gives us a calculation of 1/4 of 8 = 2 1/", "answer": " 36"}

The discount is worth 15 percent of the original price of each ticket. At least 10 percent of the tickets are sold at the discounted price. What is the maximum number of tickets the company should sell?\n\n### Demostration:\nIn the first step, it is important to identify the relationships among the possible answers (thinking quantitatively)\n\nTickets sold = 100% + Discounted tickets sold\nIf Tickets sold = 0, then Discounted tickets = 100%. If it does, then discounted tickets = 0\n\nThen, we have to find out the relation between the number of tickets sold and discounted tickets.\n\nIf discounted tickets sold = more than number of normal tickets sold = greater than 100%\n\nif discount tickets sold <100% = number of discounted tickets<number of tickets sold = less than 100%.\n\nThinking logically, if there are less discounted tickets to be sold then less number of tickets are sold at a discount.\n\nNow it can be clearly seen that if discount tickets is more than or equal to tickets sold then 100% of the tickets will be sold at a discount, thus 10% tickets will be sold for 10% price discount.\n\nThis results in tickets sold = 0 and discount tickets = 15\nThus, the max discount that tickets are being given is 15\n\nTherefore, how many tickets should the company sell if they want to", "answer": " 22"}

If we consider the quantity and the price, it makes more sense to the answer as $31.5 for extra pound of cheese, instead of $30. Hence, the correct answer is $31.\n3. The question states that he bought 2 pounds of cheese and the price is $30. However, it is assumed that one pound of chees is sold at $30. So, it's $30 per one pound, which means $300 in total.\n4.

Since eighty-four (the number of people waiting) divided by the number of rides (four) is twenty-six (the number of total lines to give to every person), we can then determine that the ride operator will need to ride the roller coaster twenty-six times to give everyone their full ride. The answer would then be A: 26.\n\n### Explain: The ride operator is only required to give twenty-six rides to everyone in line.\nTo prove this claim, imagine this situation: If you stood in a line of people, let's say three or four hundred in line, and you were asked to give everyone in line ten turns on the ride, you wouldn't need to give each individual person ten rides, rather you could just ride the thing once for everyone and your job would be complete. Likewise, the ride operator for the roller coaster can simply ride the thing twenty-six riders, and everyone standing in line will receive the full number of rides they are entitled to. This process requires no more cars running than one.", "answer": " 6"}

The question asks to justify the answer with a statement that explains why you will buy a product the next day.\n2. There are at least three good reasons to buy a product the next time you shop, or do you have a better reason for buying a product the next day? Here are a few reasons to buy a product: \na) To save money - You can use your discount coupon or get a promotion during your purchase. \nb) To do research before making a purchase - This gives you time to look at all aspects of the product and compare it with other products, so you are sure it is the product you want.\nc) To get support - This is very important when you buy a product. If you get support, many times you will get quicker results and can get any information that you need about the product.\nd) To compare prices - After choosing your product, check if the price on the website is the best one. Use shopping tips and reviews from other customers to find the best price for the product you bought. \ne) To feel safe and secure - One of the things you have to look at is the security. Security is important when you are buying something online or visiting an online store. Making sure the product is safe is a very important factor when you purchase anything online, if the website is secure. \nThese are some good reasons to buy an item the next day.

Let us know that each person increased the amount of fuel by 3 gallons, not 2.\n\nWe can find the total number gallons by adding the total gallons per person and the total gallons per crew member:\n\n(20*30+3*60)+(2*30)+(60+2*30) = 580+60+180 = 5080 gallons\n\nThus, the total number of gallon required is 2760+5080 = 7840 gallons.\n\nStep 1\n\nStep 2\n\nStep 3\n\nStep 4\n\nStep 5\n\nStep 6\n\nAnswer: C\n\nInput:The most dangerous animal on the planet is?

The first word of the sentence is 'where'. This means we can rule out choices between the cobblestone, in a ditch, and on the rooftop, since they are not relevant to the location of the body parts. \n2. The next phrase is 'the monster' which refers to a particular monster, not to a set of unmentioned monsters, so if it had hid the body parts in any of the places in Choices A, B, or C, the monster would have had to make this very clear in the sentence. \n3.

{"text": "### Demostraction:-\n\n### Explanatory answer:\nThis question could be rephrased as follows: \"If 1 gallon of paint covers 600 square ft, how many gallons do we need to paint it?\" which can be rephrased as \"If [quantity] covers [area], how many [quantities] do we need to cover [area]?\" We know that 1 gallon covers 600 sq. ft, so \"square ft\" of area is equal to \"gallon\" of quantity. Since \"unit\" is equal to \"area\", \"gallon\" must be equal to \"square ft\". So, area is also equal to \"gallons\".\n\nWe know that the \"living room\" takes up 600 sq ft. And that there are 3 bedrooms each occupying 400 sq ft. So, the sum of the 400 sq. ft. of each bedroom and the 600 sq f.t. of the living room = 600+600+6 x 400 = 1000 sq ft. Therefore, 1 gallon covers this area, and as we know that there are 1000 gallons, we therefore need 1000 (gallons).\nThis problem can be solved in a more abstract concept of the units themselves. In the above diagram, the units can be thought of as being made up of smaller elements, in this case, the elements of the units themselves. As we know each of those areas are equal to each other, we can multiply the size of one small element by the amount of elements required for that area, to arrive at the total area for that whole unit. The same thing can be applied to the question. In order to arrive at the total quantity of gallons of paint, we must multiply the quantity required for each unit, by the amount of units needed.\n\n### Exemplary answer:\nHenrietta is going to paint the house.\n\nHer living room is 600 square meters.\n\nShe has 3 bedrooms.

You can sell 1 egg for $0.30, 5 eggs for $1.50, 10 for $3, and 12 for $4.80. How much will you make?\n\n### Demostration:\n Input:The question consists of several statements, each given the price of a group of eggs of different sizes.\n\n1. Each statement gives the cost of a group of eggs and the number of eggs in that group. For example, the first statement says the cost is 0.30 and that the group contains 1 egg.\n2. Based on the statements, we can understand that all groups are sold in multiples of 5. For example, the statement 5 eggs costs 1.50. This makes sense because buying 5 eggs is much cheaper than buying one egg.\n3. To solve, first we have to work out the amounts that the eggs cost in each group. For each statement, multiply that number by 5 for the number of eggs.\n4. So, for the first statement, the 1 egg costs 0.05. The next statement gives a cost of 1.50, and this cost must be multiplied by the 5 eggs. The next statement gives the cost of 3, and this is multiplied by the number of 12 eggs.\n5. Note the prices given for each group are also multiplied by 5 for the total number of eggs in that price range. The total is then multiplied by the number you sell.\n6. So, the first group costs 0.01, the second costs 5 x $0.05 or 0.25, and the third costs 6 x $0.03 or 0.18. Next, the number of eggs sold is 5 x 1, then 5 x 5, then 5 x12.\n7. So,", "answer": " 16"}

Mr. Benson obtained a discount according to the formula, \u201cFor every ticket bought after 10, the discount is given as a percent of that ticket.\" If you see a percent sign instead of a multiplication symbol, and if you find more than one term being multiplied, the formula will usually be in the form x%=A where A is a number, not a variable such as x.\n2.

This leaves 5 stamps left. \n4. Each of the remaining 5 stamps will be used for the \"thank you\" cards. \n5. There are 3 \"thank you\" choices left which require 3 stamps each, so the total number of \"thank you\" stamps required is 3*5 = 15. \n6.

We assume that her monthly check is equal to her amount of working hours per month times $8 per hour since that's the minimum her pay per hour for this job.  \n\nIn this case, working hours in a month = 35 hours per month * $8 per hour / hour = $320  \nMonthly check = $320\n\nTo calculate her savings, we need to subtract the monthly check (320$) from the amount that she wants to buy her bike i.e. ($400). This gives: Savings = $400-320 = $80  \n\nNow that we know the amount of money that Carrie wants to spend, we need to know the total amount that she has saved so far. We can do this as follows: \n\nTo calculate the amount of money that she has saved so-far, we need to subtract her savings from her monthly check:\nSavings = $40 (total amount of savings so far) = $400 (money that she wants to spend)-320 (monthly check) = $(80)  \n\nSo far, Carrie has saved $(80) within the time-frame of 1 month.

{"text": "Buddy has 20 cards on Thursday. \n\n### Rationales:Step 1: Buddy has 36 cards on Monday.\n\nStep 1: Buddie loses 18 cards on Tuesday.\n\nStep 8: Buddy buys 24 cards on Wednesday.\n\nStep: 9: Thursday's purchase is 8 cards\n\nStep: 10: Total of all cards Buddy has on Thursday -Monday's cards - Monday's losses - Wednesday's purchase - Tuesday's purchase= 0\n\nStep: 2: If Buddy loses half the number of cards on Tuesday (18), that will make it so he has 9 on Tuesday. Subtract 9 from 36, and then divide that answer by 3 to find the remainder. Then multiply by 100 to get the percentage. That means that as of Tuesday, 90% of Buddy's cards were left.\n\nStep:11: Subtract the days of the week, which in this case is Monday+1, which is Tuesday.\nStep: 12: Use the same logic as the last step, taking out the remainder and multiplying by 100.\nStep: 23: Find another percentage of the total number of baseball cards. Again use the remainder equation above to get it. This time it will subtract Monday's number as well as Tuesday's. \nStep: 24: Again use remainder on remainder equations to get the percentage.

Here is the answer.\"\n\n### Demand:\nInput:Which one of these questions is most likely to be in the news in the coming weeks? Choices:  Hurricane Wanda A: Stormy weather B: High taxes C: Flood D: Disease E: Drought\nRationales: The question asks which of the choices is most likely to be reported on in the news.\n\nStep 1: There is one likely candidate in C: Flood and that's an excellent choice.\nStep 2: However, it should be pointed out that E: Drought is a good choice because a drought situation can lead to other issues, such as crop failure, disease, migration, etc. So the answer should be either C or E.\nStep 3: Evaluate the first choice: Hurricane Wanda. A hurricane is a type of storm. There are many types of storms, so a hurricane will not likely be the only natural event that will be in the news in a coming week. We can eliminate that choice.\nStep 4: It helps to list the choices.\nStep 5: Listing the choices helps to confirm our evaluation. Considering only natural disasters, we can eliminate C: Flood and E: Drought. For C: Flood, floods can be caused by many different things and it's not clear if the flood will be a localized event or not, a natural disaster or something man-made like a break in a levee. For E: Drought, again, it's not clear why the drought is happening or what its impacts will be, so there is no evidence to support an answer choice that has the same ambiguity as the question itself. \nStep 6: Therefore, the only candidates left are Stormy weather and High taxes.

In addition, specific feedback is more likely to be helpful to the student while vague feedback does not give them much information to use.\n2. Provide more positives than negatives. When offering constructive feedback is helpful to the student if you provide at least three positive statements for every negative statement. Having all positives or all negatives may actually be worse than having no feedback because students may get upset at the feedback or be discouraged by the negative.\n3. Offer specific examples.

{"text": "A: 3\n\n### Democription:\n\n### Instructions: \n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. Let's calculate this first by assuming the rope is 20 feet in length. As Tom needs six stories, he will need to cut 6 times 10 feet out of the 20 feet's length. Hence, we end up with 120 feet of cut-off rope.\n\n2. As you lose 25 percent of the rope each time you lash the two pieces, the total loss is 0.25 times 120 feet which comes out to 30 feet.\n\n3. Now, with 20 feet of rope, the total length will be 15 feet.\n\n4. Therefore, based on this simple calculation, we need to buy 3 pieces of rope to lower a rope 6 stories.\n\nStep 1: \n\nStep 2 \n\nStep 3 \n\nStep 4 \n\nAnswer: A: 3 \n\n### Demoration:\n\n### Input; It's a beautiful day! The sea is so blue and the sand so fine, it would take forever to build a sandcastle! \n\n### Response; It would take forever to build the castle, yes?\n\n### Democracy:\n\n### Rationale: \n\n1) The preposition \"of\" after sand gives the sense of location. \n\n2) It would take forever to built the castle  gives the sense that it is a place we have never been to or heard about.\n\n3) The conjunction \"and\" implies that the two parts are related. It creates contrast in the phrase and provides a rhythmic effect.\n\n4) The clause \"The sea is so blue\" means that the sea is beautiful as it is blue. So the sentence has 3 parts: the sea is blue, it's a beautiful day, and it's a beautiful sandcastle.\n\n5) The relative pronoun introduces a relative clause.\n\nAnswer:It would take forever to built(built in the sentence is the correct, but not in the question.) a sandcastle!

The answer to be obtained is time for Max's homework.\n\nSince we want to find out how much time Max spent on his homework, the amount of time he spent on his biology homework is not useful to us here.\n\nTherefore, we just consider the time he spent on his other two homework: history and geography.\nNow from the given information, we know that the time Max spent on doing his history homework was twice as that he spent on his geography homework.\n\nThis means that the time he took on his geography home was three times as that he took on his history home and this means that his total time spent on his homework was thus:\n\ntime for his geography homework was = 90 minutes\n\ntime for his physics homework was = (90 minutes\u00d73) = 270 minutes.\n\n\n### Step3\n\nThe answer to be obtained in the task is 'time for Max's home work?' based on the information given in Step2.\n\nSince we now know the amount of time Max spent on his history home work and on his geography home work, we can find out the total time he spent on his homework.The formula for finding the total time Max spent on his tasks is:\n\ntotal time Max spent on his task = total time spent on homework 1 = time spend on history + time spent on geography\n\ntotal time Max spend on his task = (2", "answer": " 180"}

There are total 1000 + 1666 + 1667 + 1668... + 166965 packages (since the first one is 1000, for the second one you subtract 1000 from 1000 then add 1667, which is 1359, and so on). So in a day, 1000+ packages are shipped and 1666+ packages per day is the total, meaning they make an average of $528 a day.\n\nLet's look at the second center. Since it processes three times the amount of packages as the first center, it processes 2000+ packages. Meaning the total for the second center is $7592, since the second center processes 1250 more packages.\n\nNow, we calculate profit of each center per week.

{"text": "After a brief break on Wednesday, Steve's berry-picking career started with a bang on day 2! He picked 8 pounds of lingonberies on the first day, then he went off to bed. Three times as many berries were picked on day two, which means he picked 25 pounds on Tuesday. As for Thursday, Steve picked 0 pounds.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe initial context indicates that Steve made a total of $16 (by picking 8 pounds of berries on each day except Thursday).\nDay 1, Monday:\n$$\\frac{2\\times8}{1}\\times1=\\$8$$\nDay 2, Tuesday:\n$$\\frac 23\\times3\\times8=\\$$\nDay 3, Wednesday:\nSteve rests, so no picking.\nDay 4, Thursday:\n$$\\begin{align}\n\\frac 23(0)-(0)\\equiv0\\ \\ \\text{($0\\,\\text{pounds is not equal to}\\frac 23 \\,\\text{pounds}\\,$)} \\end{align}\n$$\nTherefore, Steve made a total of \\$16 and spent the rest of the days relaxing.\n\nAnswer: Choice (E) is inappropriate. Here, there is no reason to say that \"the machine\" is something made of metal. The phrase \"an apparatus\" already conveys a sense of complexity: \"an apparatus\" is used to describe things such as scientific equipment that require precision and care, whereas the phrase \"a box\" (choices A and E) does not suggest that.\n\nThe word \"wash\" could be used for a task that something else performs; we wouldn't describe a washing machine as an \"appliance\" because it washes. Here, all the choices are nouns (the only verb used is \"to wash\"), so it's relevant to consider the question as it is with nouns. The best fit is \"apparatus\" because it would make the most sense in the context of something that one describes as \"intricate.\" That would be an \"apparatus,\" to use the original definition. \"Implement\" would be an appropriate answer if the question asked specifically what it", "answer": " 18"}

So he worked 8 days.\nThe second is days. It counts days he worked for each type of dates. Example, 3rd to 5th means from 3rd Friday to 5th Saturday.

To be \"homeless\" does not mean to live inside an object, whether it be a tree, a box, or a cave. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, the term \"homeless\" is used to describe \"people who have no fixed home and are forced to live on the streets.\" 2. \"Wolves\" do not \"live in\" something because wolves are not \"living organisms,\" according to the Oxford Dictionary.\n3. To be \"squirmy\" is to be \"wriggly or twitchy.\" This definition is consistent with dictionary.com, Cambridge Dictionary, Oxford Dictionary, Oxford Learners' Dictionary, and Merriam-Webster dictionary. 4. Being \"fleeting\" is defined by the Cambridge Dictionary as \"short-lived\" or \"lasting for a very short time.\" A \"thing,\" as defined by a dictionary, can be a \"thing\" or a \"material object.\"\n5.

These two choices are the correct answer to the question.\n\nThe reason a flat coin has a raised edge is because it is easy to distinguish one side from the other. But, what if there is another design on both sides?\n3.Option B. flat and design. This doesn't fit with the description of a coin because on a coin both sides are distinctly visible, which cannot be said for both sides of the coin.\n4.Option C is \"face and flat\". These terms represent the two sides of a coin, but they are not the faces and the flat sides. These are more like the other options from before. \n5.Option D. flat and face. Likewise, this does not fit with the description because it also refers to the two sides of a double-sided coin. \n6.Option E. face and design. This is a little bit complicated to understand, but let's try anyway. The term \"design\" here refers to the raised pattern on one side of the coin, while \"face\" is referring to the other side of the coin. \n7.When looking up these terms in a dictionary, they refer to the front or side that the person can see and which shows a certain pattern or shape. This is because a face is the part of the human body that represents the person as a whole and it also refers to the flat side of a coin.\n8.Hence, the correct responses are 1 & 2.\nAnswer: 1 & 2\n\n# This project contains content from the [Coursera Machine Learning](https://www.cour", "answer": " 75"}

According to the question,\n\nFive years are four F plus two R.\nThree years are three F plus four H.\nSix years are six F plus two R. The average life expectancy of Ruth's fish is 6/5.\nAccording to the problem,\nFive years are 4x5.\nThree years are 4x3.\nSix years equals 7(4+2).\nIf one were to take the average of the expected life of the fish and the expected life of the dog, 2 + 4 = 6.\nSo, 6 divided by 5 is 1.2. 1.2 times 2.5 is 3.\nSubtract 6 from 5 and multiply with 4.

The difference between the heaviest pumpkin and the lightest pumpkins is 29 pounds. In order to bring that number to a smaller scale, you only need to multiply by the starting point of 34.

{"text": "It is given that together, the Chrysler Building and Leeward Center have a total of 11 more floops. This would make the total floors of both buildings 35 (since it was also stated there are 35 floors together). To solve this you can assume a simple 1 to 1 comparison. Meaning that for every 1 added to Leeward Center, you add 1 to Chrysler Building.\n\nBy doing this you can determine that the Chrysler Building has [$0.99 * 11]$ floors. So if I plug in a $0.99 and an 11 I get $9.99 as a first approximation, however we'll need to subtract 1 for the tower as it was already said that Chrysler Building has more floors than Leeward Center.

Step 2: The total amount of food the puppies and dogs eat depends on the number of puppies and the total number of dog and puppy. Step 3: So, for the question above, we know that if there are puppies and dogs, and each dog eats twice as often as a puppy, we need to think about them separately (since they are different sizes). In this case, we need the number of pupppies and the number of puppppies. Step 4: If we have 3 dogs and 4 puppies then we know that each dog will eat 4 pounds of food: 4\u00d73=12 pounds.

A key isn't in the green box it's used in the box and unlocks the box.\n3. Answer P: \"a key.\" As in answer A, this suggests an action rather than a thing.\n4.

The choices are A: 21days, B: 17days, C: 22days, D: 20days and E: 18days.\n3. Since the choices are not in the order of the amount, we should first calculate the answer.\n4. Let's start from A: 21. If 24 people have 1 week of vacations, how much time is that? It is 24/7 which is 3.5 days or 3 x 7. If 1 week includes Saturday and Sunday, which is 2 days, it is 3 x 5.\n5. Since there is a full-time employee and part-time employee, we should sum up the result:\n  1. 3 x 5+(3 x 7)= 23.5\n  2. Then, we can add another 1 for vacation during the half days, which is 24.\n  3. If 24 days includes weekend (Saturday + Sunday) and there are 7 days in a week, the answer is less than 24. Then, we need to subtract the weekend from 24: 24-2 = 22days. Hence, the answer for A: 22 days.

{"text": "(a) Let's start by analyzing the amount of pizza he can eat. The first problem is to determine how many slices are on each of the 6 pizzas. There are 16 slices on each large pizza and 8 on each small, so we can say that there are 2 pizzas that have 16 slices, 4 pizzas that have eight slices, and two that have 8 slices. Note that these numbers must sum to 6 pizzas altogether. The second problem is to find out how many slices he eats. Since he eats it all and there are 24 slices each pizza, we can multiply the number of pizzas by the number of slices to find out how many pieces he eats. There are a total of 2\u00d724=48 slices of pizza, which is how many pieces we are looking for. (b) That's easy!

{"text": "First, notice that the volume of salt is unknown. Hence, it may be necessary to first perform a trial and error computation with a small input value before providing accurate information. Suppose, salt density = 2 kg/L and sea water density = 1020 kg/m^3. Thus, the ratio between S and SW is 1/1020.\n\nSecond, if 20% of sea water = 20% of (1020 kg / m^3), then 2% of 1020 is ~2100 kg / m^2 or ~2.1 kg. Hence, 20% of 1000 is 200 kg and 20% of water = ~2000 kg = ~ 1.98 kg.\n\nThird, Jack will have evaporated 1000 g of water from a bucket of water with half the volume, say 500 ml. Considering that the ratio between salt and SW after evaporation is 1/1.98, then 1000 * (1.98)/200 = 100.27 g of salt. Note that this value changes every time salt evaporates, but the ratio between salt and water will remain 1/1.2. In other words if there were 4000 ml of 20% sea water, then every time 67.50 ml evaporates, the salt level will increase by 100.67 g.\n\nNext, notice that Jack can collect and dry 10 kg of salt at one time, which is 10 times more than 100.77 g, since the latter was from ~2.5 liters of 20% concentrated sea water. Therefore, Jack can collect and dry the salt from 250 liters of sea water every time.\n\nFourth, the volume of water needed to collect to evaporate 1000g of water for the second time is 250000 ml, or 2500 liters.\n\nFinally, the volume of salt desired is 2000 kg or 1980000 mL.

Thus the answers must be internal (not external). For instance, a hacking attack via webpages, emails, etc. which come from an outside source would be an external threat. Since the internal threats are internal (coming from within), we have two options - malware and insiders:\n\n### 1. Let't look into each choice.\n### 2. Malware: This is a general term denoting any malicious program of malicious code. Hence, malware includes viruses, worms, etc which are a threat to computer security.\n### 3. Insiders: An insider is a person who is working within an organization or company.  Whenever an insider can maliciously access private information or damage an organization, it's an threat of security. For example, an insider can delete documents, leak confidential information to outside parties, etc.\n\n### From the evaluation, it seems that the internal threats can be malware or insiders:\n### 4. So, is it likely that an insider is more likely to steal confidential information than to launch a hacking attack on the company? Well. It depends. An insider can either leak information to external groups or directly hack the company", "answer": " 6"}

They offer coupons on their own name brand products. 3. They offer coupons that include a free gift with purchase. 4. They offer coupons when a customer buys a bundle of video games. 5. They offer coupons as a reward for repeat customers.\n\nRationales: Option 1: A coupon is a type of discount that can be claimed at the register. However, this coupon is only valid for first-time customers, so regular customers wouldn't get any benefit. Option 2: Involves some kind of discount that is exclusive to customers who buy the store's own name brands of a product. Option 3: Offers customers a free gift when they purchase specific products. Option 4: Offers customers a discount when they buy a bundle of products. Option 5: Rewards existing customers with coupons.\n\nOptions 1\u20134 are all valid types of coupons that can be offered by stores.

{"text": "Simon would receive $5.03 back from Simon would receive $3.04 back from Simon would receive 3.11 back from Simon would receive back from Simon would receive\n\n### Demostration:\n\nStep 1:Simon would receive $30.03 total if their bill was exactly $50. However, Simon's bill was not $50 exactly. The closest bill to $50 is $49.99. In this case, Simon's bill would be $49.96.Step 2:Using the formula, the total is the bill minus 9 times the change percent, which is $0.04. Step 3: Multiply the total by 100 to convert the percent to a dollar amount.Step 4: Round the result to the nearest cent. Step 5: Use the amount of change as the number of times to multiply in Step 2 so that the change is equal to the total. In this case, that is 3 (.25 is multiplied by 12, which is 2.5 x 12. Therefore, Simon would receive back 3 x $3 = $9, and because this number is over $3, he would receive back $9.00 in total.\n\n### Output:The money saved for the down payment is 20 of the total.

{"text": "The total cost of the gift after the rebate is 848.26.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Since Mr Grey has spent a total of 948.26, 12 have been cut from his total because of a rebate. This means he received $0.12 in rebates.\n2. The rebate equals the total amount paid so the price paid reduces the value of the gifts.\n3. The sum of all the costs before the discount was 948.53.\n4. The sum of the costs after Mr Grey's discount is 836.31.\n5. The total of the gifts is Mr Grey's cost for gifts which is 948.76, before any discount.\n6. The cost after the discount is reduced to 836.45 because after the rebate, the amount he spent on the gifts is reduced by 12 dollars.\n\n### Input\nMr Blue was purchasing gifts for Mr Blue's family. So far he had purchased 6 polo shirts with the tag A for $26 each, a shirt with tag B for $60, one necklace with tag D for $83, and 1 computer game with tag F for $90. The computer game Mr Blue bought received a $50 discount. The necklace received a $5 discount, the polo shirts received a $2 discount and the shirt received a $10 discount because Mr Blue received a $29 gift card which is not included in the purchase. Since Mr Blue paid for all these purchases using his credit card, Mr Blue also received a $12 credit. What is the total amount Mr Blue spent purchasing the gifts for his family?\nRationale: Mr Blue spent a total of 1256 dollars. 1256 - 29 - 5 - 10 = 882 dollars.

The way we solve this is to use division to figure it out:\n\nTherefore, the answer is that Jack needs to sell 375 cookies to reach his target amount of $50.\n\n#### Demo:\n\n\n### Input:\"A\" is the answer choice.

The choices should be ordered in terms of the volume of a sphere in terms of units (\u03c0r\u00b3 vs 3.14r\u00b3). This means, that the first option will have answer S: 4/9\u03c0r\u00b2 and not 4/3\u03c0.\n3. There are not too many choices, so the choices might be ordered according to the volume of a sphere using r\u00b2 units. It is highly likely that that option using (\u03c0r\u00b3) units will be the last choice.\n4. As the first and last choice are not the volume of sphere in terms of r\u00b2, we can try the second and fifth options. \n5. The second and fifth options are S: 4/\u03c0r\u00b2. These two options have the same number and all numbers are in r\u00b2 units, this can be discarded right away.\n6. Comparing the next option (B: 4/3 or r\u00b2 unit) with the option (S: 4/3 and 3\u03c0r\u00b2 unit), we can conclude that the answer to our question would be S: 3\u03c0.\n7.

The question does not contain any information about the exact amount of grams he drinks of the energy drink, but the information does show that when he drank the two energy drinks, he only consumed 250 grm of caffeine and when he consumed the pill, he consumes 50 grams of extra. John would then consume 750 grams of the caffeine. This is confirmed in this answer by the use of the mathematical operation \"A \u00f7 B\".\n\nRationale is because: 1.

To make matters even more convoluted, the case went all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\n### Response and Rationale:\nAnswer:\nDouglas Jackson committed the crime in San Jose. He then was found guilty of a state crime, which occurred in San Jose.\nFortunately for Jackson, California law allows the conviction of an individual for a crime that occurred in a different state, as long as there was a substantial similarity.\nThe state law allows for this situation because the person committing the crime was physically located in the other state and the crime committed was similar to a crime committed in California.\n\n### Input \nCameron had to buy his girlfriend a gift that would cost more than $100.00 (100 dollars).\nIf he bought a gift that cost 20% more than $10.00 (ten dollars), how much money would he need to use to buy the gift?\nHow much money would he need if the gift cost 150% more than $25.00 (twenty-five dollars)?\n\n### Response \n\n### InputThe first gift costs 20 % more than $10 (twelve dollars).

From our information on Mark, we know that Mark uses half of his 10 total sick days, i.e., uses (\u00bd) of (10*8)=40 hours of sick days. \n\nWe can use this '40-hour-sick days' information and multiply it by.5 since the original 'Marks sick days' is equivalent to 8 hours: 40-hours-sick-days X.5 = 20-hours-actual-sick-days-used. We can use 20-h/actual-sick-used to substitute for the number of sick days that Mark used: 20-h/(actual-sick-day-used)\n\nWe would now subtract 20 hours of the original allotment of 10 to get the remaining number of unused sick days: (10-20)/h = (10-2)/h = 8/h (since each hour = 1 day/8; this is what we wanted, which is where the subtraction and the multiplication came together). We know that 1 sick day = 8 hours. \n\nNow, since 1 sick day =.5 of 8 hours =.5*16 = 8 and we have '8/h' from the last line, we can say that 8/h =.5.

That tells us that their total weight is 5+8-110=615.\n\n### Reasoning:\nIn order to solve that problem, you will need to consider a variety of factors. You should start with the question: Which information is relevant and which is irrelevant? The information relevant to the problem is: Stan weighs more than Steve, so he is the heavier weight. Steve is lighter than Jim, so when the three body weights are added, there will be an imbalance.\n\nYou can then ask yourself: What do I know that I can subtract or add as needed to get the final answer? The answer is you know Stan's weight and you know the sum of Steve's and Jim's weights.\n\nThe solution is to subtract the sum of Steve' and JIm's weights from the sum of the three weights to get the weight of Stan. This is the difference between the three and Stan's weight.\n\n### Question: Stan weighs $m/minute$ more than Steve, who weights $n/second$ less than Jim.

At 110 pounds, that's $m=6$ pounds. $m=5$ because $m=m+n$ and since $n=5$ pounds less the weight of Jim, the weight of the least person will be 110-$5=5+$5=10 pounds.\n\n### Example:\nIf the person with the largest weight steps on the scale first, the total weight will still be 6 pounds, but the person with the second largest will have $m$ plus 5 pounds.\n\n<img src=\"assets/images/59.png\" width=\"5", "answer": " 319"}

You reasoned that a \"notebook\" could be a type of \"laptop\" (lower case \"l\"). \n\nIf you said that you were not able to complete the task on your own, then you could proceed to a dictionary and discover that you were correct.\n\nIf you said \"No,\" you will need to consider what types of computers could be referred to as \"laptop\" (upper case \"L\") and see if a \"notebook\" will definitely be a different type of computer.\n\nFor example, the Dell\u2122 Inspiron\u2122 11z is often referred to as a \"laptop\" with an uppercase \"L,\" but a Google search on \"notebook laptop\" and a look at the [laptop category on Notebook Review](https://www.notebookreview.com/special-reports/laptops-buying-guide/), reveals that notebook laptops are a category of personal computers, not of laptops.\n\nAnswer: I took it to be a notebook, yes, laptops, iPads, tablets, and notebooks, but you have to remember that a notebook, is smaller than a laptop, and has very distinct markings as to its usage to distinguish it from a laptop.\n\n### Question:\nInput: How many calories does Ian Burn after running around his apartment for 5 days?

D1: Add 20 cm to the perimeter, divide by 2 and get remainder D1\nRationales: Considering the options:\n\nA1: The perimeter of the triangle can be written as 160 cm - 2(40 cm) - 2(50 cm) = 140 + 2(40) = 164 cm. If we subtract 20 cm then we get 140 +20 = 160 cm, the perimeter value, i.e. we have found the third side by subtracting 20 cm from perimeter (using the information given)\nB1: This cannot happen since we don\u2019t have any information regarding the third side of the triangle in the question.\nC1: Calculating the remainder of 160/2 (i.e., 160 divided by 2) gives the third side of the value 80 cm.\nD1: Adding 20 cm to perimeter, would lead to 140 cm + 20 (i.e.,) 160 cm again.", "answer": " 70"}

Player A has the most years playing of the three players. A has probably played basketball longer than the other two players and has spent a much longer time practicing so that they can get better, but even though B is relatively young they have probably put in the same amount of time. On the other hand, we should also consider the size of those players, the larger a player is, the easier they will have it because they will be stronger and more durable. Player B is much bigger than player A, so this gives B an advantage B should have no trouble against Player B. Player A has the same physical skills so they are probably about equal in strength and durability. Player C has the advantage of being fast and quicker as that will give C the ability to get the ball, but B is also going to be the best at running and jumping to get that ball. B could probably run faster than A. Player A has more experience in that position, making them the best choice. \n### Answer:B\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Input:(A is 3 feet tall and B is 1 foot tall)\n\n### Ration:\n\nIn this question there are three possibilities.

We can assume that the amount of vegetables eaten is cumulative between the time (Sunday and Thursday) since the question and the daily minimum is averaged in a week.\n2. We can use the formula \"Sunday + Monday... + Thursday\" and the first half of the equation is \"(8 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)\" and then we add the last half of the equation. We can get 33/7 or 4.71.

Since \"he can't\" is the same word in the phrase in reverse, but \"he\" is placed first, it should be the subject of the sentence. The subject of the sentence comes before the predicate with no intervening conjunction. \"Cannot\" does not represent this structure because \"can't\" is incorrect in this phrase if \"can't\" comes before the subject; it would result in a grammatically incorrect phrase (i.e., incorrect in a grammatical sense): \"can't he can't trust he.\" \"Can't\" is incorrect when \"he\" precedes \"can't,\" making it the object of the sentence and resulting in a grammatically incorrect sentence. \"Trusted\" is incorrect because \"trusted\" is not a verb structure and therefore cannot be the predicate of a sentence. \"Trusted he,\" however, would be a grammatically incorrect sentence unless \"he\" came after \"trusted;\" in that case, this structure would be the predicate of the sentence.\n\nAnswer: A\n\n### Input:(9 \u00d7 5) is equivalent to: ___ times 9 times 5 Choices:  A \u00d7 B \u00d7 C B \u00d7 C \u00d7 A C \u00d7 B \u00d7 A C \u00d7 A \u00d7 B A \u00d7 B \u00d7 C\nRationales: (9 \u00d7 5) can be represented as 9 multiplied by 5: 9 \u00d7 5, or 9 times 5, or 5 times 9.\n\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input::Gravitational force is the most well-known form of force.

{"text": "The answer to the question \"how many inches tall is Grossie?\" is 55.\n\n### Justification:\n* Let's start by breaking down the three pieces of information to simplify them and see if we can get a sense of the relationship between the heights of each person. \n* Grayson is 2 inches taller (1 inch > 0 inch) and 7 inches shorter (- 7 inches > -1inch) of Gracie, which means 8 inches = 15 inches (9 inches).\n* Gracie is 58 inches tall (80 inches\u20137 inches = 73 inches \u2013 Gracie\u2019s height subtracted from Grayson\u2019s height).\n* Grayson\u2019s height is 80 (the sum or addition of Gracie\u2019s 80 and Grayson\u2019s 80). It subtracted from the above 73 inches, resulting in 34 (10 inches).\n* Griffin\u2019s height is 61 (above 70).\n* 61 subtracted from the above, 64, equals -3 (0 inch >-1inch). \n* Subtract 20 (34 \u2013 14) from 3 ( -3). 21 (51 inches or 129 inch, which can be interpreted as 129 in 129 in which 119 goes to 36).\n* Divide 64 (34 + 3) by 20 to see how many parts in a whole, and we get 3.20.\n* Finally, we simply multiply 3.20 by 129 to make 3.20 X 129 inches, hence we get 410 inches.\nAnswer: Gracie is 410 inches tall.\n\n### Input2:Gracie was short, Grayson was tall, Griffin was medium, Gracie was tall. How does Gracie stand tall?\n\n### Demostration:\n* Let'll first break down the three pieces of data and see if we can create a simple, coherent sentence with them.\n* Gracie's height was 410 (= 80 - 34 - 3) inches tall", "answer": " 56"}
{"text": "The maximum number of open parking spots in all levels are 52. There are 5 more spots per level from the 2nd to the 3rd level and again from the 3rd to the 4th level.\nAnswer: 52 (493 spots). 100*4=400+100*3=300+10*4=45+15*3=45+30/2=30=60+10*3=35+30/5=16=56+20=76/2=38=68+10*4+10=104. (Total 493 out of 500) Explanation: Here, the 4th floor has 31 spots. Since there are 51 open spots in the 1st level, 9 open spots in 2nd level, 13 open spots in 3rd level and 18 open spots in 4th level, we see that 18 + 9 + 13 + 51 = 104 spots are available. So the total number of spots are 500 where 482 are parking spaces. And the last 18 spaces are spots where people can park, thus the total number of spikes is 500-18 = 482 = 64.82. Then add 64.83 spikes where people can park, 64.85, 64.90 as well as 493, for the parking spaces available to the public 500-64.90=415: The car owners only have 18 spots. The maximum number of open spots in all levels is 52 which equals to 104 minus 52, because 52 is the maximum number of spokes not to leave the car.\n\n### Inputs: 1.

Choices:\nA: 42 B: 6 C: 26 D: 48 E: 30\nRationales:\n1. In the answer choices presented, the correct answer should be the number with the smallest difference to the sum of 19 and 24.\n2. 18 and 12 have a five-digit difference. However, 24 and 20 have the same four-digit difference, making them equal for the purpose of this task. \n3. The choice that has the smallest difference is (20 - 18), so 20 - 19 is a better choice.\n4. Looking at the answer choices presented, answer E is (30 - 18) - which does not match 20 - 20.\n5.

Create a function that is truth for every premise, but can only be false (i.e. truth cannot be derived by any of its premises). Also note that \"truth\" here does not necessarily correspond to logical truth, but can be truth in the informal sense. In the case of logical truth, the truth value of the premises should be logical truths (or contradictions or logical inconsistencies), otherwise a false function will be accepted.\n\nInput: A new machine which was created was a _____*.

The choice of answer options suggests that the man needs a tool or device that can be \"sawed\" through a sturdy object, like the branch of a large tree.\n\n1. The answers are:  A: chisel, B: saw, C: axe, D: screwdriver, and E: hammer.\n2. Let's consider how each option corresponds to the man's actions.  There are a few ways a man could saw through a large tree branch. He could use an axe, but an axe is probably too small and weak to accomplish such a task. So, we can eliminate A: axe. Then he could use a saw, but this word also has different meanings. For example, you could saw through wood with a handsaw. A saw could also be used to slice through a rope or fabric.\n\n3. There are other tools and objects that could be employed to accomplish this task. An ice pick seems like a bizarre choice to use on a large branch, so we can also eliminate A: icepick. Scissors could be used to cut paper, but it's not likely you'd want to cut a large branch with them. Thus, we can rule out D scissors. \n\n4. With that, we can narrow down the answer choices to B: saw, C; axe, and E: hamme.\n\n5. The answer E: hammer is a common tool used for various tasks, such as striking metal objects, hammering nails in, or tightening screws. It's unlikely the old man would have been trying to tackle a rope with his hammer, so we can eliminate E hammer. The answer choice A: chisel is an appropriate answer because it is a small, hard tool that can be used to cut through wood. It's very similar to a saw in that the user has to \"saw\" through wood in order to accomplish the cutting action. However,", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "He will eat a meatball and a half \n\n### Justification:The number of meatballs is equal in number to the number of members in the family. However, the total weight of the meat must also be equal and the number of members in a family is a fraction of 8, so this is equivalent to him eating  9/8 of a meatball (the recipe calls for 1/16 of a pound of meatball, but recipes assume you'll eat the full 1/16 (9/16) of a meatball). Since you already know he'll be eating a meatball and a 1/4 of one, I figure he'll be eaten a meatball and a fractions of one and the second meatball he'll eat will be the first meatball. In total, that is 9/8 of a pounded. For example, a 1/4 pound meatball = 1/4 lb = 9/4 lb = 22/4 lb = 5.5lbs. (A fraction of one lb =.25 lb) He has 12 people to feed, so 4 pounds of meat =12/8 lb =12/8 x.7 lb =.9 lb. Antonio doesn't have to be perfect at math to follow this.\n\n### Input : 26.

{"text": "4 more times a week\n\n### Rationales:\nStep 1: Look at the given numbers which describe the times the two swimmers each went to the swimming pool. \n\nStep 2. Consider that each swimmer went to the swimming-pool 16 times in a particular month. \n\nStep3. This means, in that month, each of the two swimmers went, at least, 2 times per week. Since, in that month each of them went 16 times in total, and each of them went to the pool at least 2 times per week, it's clear that each of them went to pool 8 times that month. It's also clear that each of them should've gone to pool on one day less when they are divided equally among 4 weekly sessions. \n\nStep4. Now comes the core of the reasoning. Since each of them went, at least, once a week on the 5th session, this means that one of them must have gone, at least once, the remaining 4 weekly sessions of the month. \n\nHere, is where the problem gets interesting. Let say Camden went on the remaining 4 sessions and Susannah didn't. This means that he (Camden) didn't go on any session throughout the month, which is absolutely impossible. This is because no one would give up to swim for 4 weeks without skipping any week at least once, in particular when the person is so obsessed with swimming like Susannah and Camden. \n\nTherefore, Camden and Susannah must have gone to the pool equally among 4 week sessions. \n\nThereby, if Camden went to the pool 8 times, this means Susannah must have 9 times. \n\nHere comes the crucial part of the solution. This is where we want to find the number of times Susannah went to the pool, in comparison to Camden's weekly sessions. Therefore, the difference between 9 and 8, must be, at least, 1. This is because if Susannah went to pool 'n' times more than Camden (say n = 9 for simplicity), this means she went to the pool 10 times if Camden went to pool just 8 times. \n\nHence, using this approach, we", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "The landscaping business earned $6 a hour for mowing of the lawns, $9 for putting of mulch and $11 for pulling the weeds in September. \n```\n\n### Explanation:\n```\nThe total cost for putting down mulch was $9 * 10 hours = $90.\n```\n```\nThe total profit for mowing the lawns was $556 - $6 * 63 hours = $387. Thus, there is a total profit of $387.\n```\n```The total profit for pulling of the weeds came out to be $252 which is $11 * 9 hours = $99.\n```\n```Since, in total profit, the total cost has to be subtracted from the total profit the profit for the total cost earned will be a positive number. That is $11 *10 = 110 dollars.\n```\n```Thus, the amount earned is $387+$90+$110$=689\n```\n\n```\n### Instruction:\"Grace started her own lawn service business.

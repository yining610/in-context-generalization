Actions can also win if there's an error; for example, if the last picked value was hammer and the first player typed in 3, hammer wins.\n\nThe game has 3 modes:\n\n1. Normal mode, where both participants have to play the game at the same time and their turns will be calculated based on their typing speed. There will be a delay that will keep your opponents from typing until 1 second before the end of that player's turn. \n1.

The product of 5 and 8 is thus 40. Thus, the product of 14 and 8 is 112 and the sum of the quotients of 19 by 8 is ten. The quotient of 15 by 8 is 1, the quotient of 14 by 8 is 0 and the quotient of 9 by 8 is 75. The quotient of two numbers is thus 75. The sum of two quotients is 74. The quotient of the sum of the integers by 7 is 3 and the quotient of the sum by 8 is 8. It is thus required to multiply these numbers to get 24, which is the same as 8 times 3. Thus, the product needed is 24. The minimum number of products needed to get the answer is thus 9.\n    </p>", "answer": " 304"}

Then a player, selected at random, secretly chooses 2 dice from the 6 that were thrown. The chosen dice are placed on a tray. The player then chooses 2 more of the 6 dice, and then these 2 dice are also placed on the tray. The 2 dice chosen first determine the value of the point. The other 2 dice determine whether this point will be added to a previous one or not (that is, they determine whether the turn ends or not). If they add to a previous point, you can add another one. You can continue playing like this until you complete the task, that is, when you take all 6 throws (for example, you may need to throw 5 dice, but not 6).\nQuestion: What is the probability that the player will complete the task?

{"text": "926\n\nInput:The output of the machine is always the input plus 22. So if the input is 9, the output is 9 + 22 = 31\nOutput:31\n[2nd Case]\n\nThe output of the machine was 169, that means the input in the first case must now be 169 + 22 or 191. But 191 is not a whole-number input to the machine. We must keep on doubling the input untill we have a whole number input that is >=169. For example, if we start by inputting 22, we will get back the same machine output of 169, so we double 22 to now have 44 which is also 169 is not a multiple of 44, so we doubled again to now have 88. But 88 is still not 169. So we have once again to double it. 169 is a multiple of 17 and 34. Let's try to input 16, we got 16 + 22 back = 38 and now we get 16.259 which is not an input number. Let's try 34, we got 34 + 22 =66 which is the same return value of 169.\n\nOutput:16\n\nInput:There are two numbers in the ratio 24:27, you have only two counters to calculate the ratio, how can you do it?\nOutput:25\n\nInput: 80, a number with many factors.

This machine might require someone to manually adjust some machine to complete a specific task, and that requires human thinking and experience. This type of machine is called industrial automation.\n\n### How do we solve the problem?\nIn this course students should focus on this two skills:\n1. How to apply machine learning algorithm to solve certain types of problems, mainly image analysis.\n2. How to use deep learning algorithm to help automation.\n\nIn this course students will learn the basic theory of a wide range of machine learning algorithms, including deep learning, Bayesian statistics and the core theory. Finally student will learn and practice how to use machine learning algorithm in solving certain problems.\n\n### Required Knowledge:\n\nThe core knowledge of this course is:\n* **Bayesian Statistics**, including **Variational Inference** and **MAP inference**. There are some background knowledge needed in this course, for example, probability, linear algebra, optimization.\n* Convnet, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Autoencoders, Reinforcements Learning.\n\nIn addition, to complete the exercises, students should have some experience with programming; and if you want to contribute a exercise there is no special requirement, but programming experience will help you design a better exercise and give you a chance to experience what programming problems looks like. There is an optional programming tutorial in appendix to give you some idea about programming in this course.\n\n### Instruction:\nTo understand the basic knowledge of this course, we use the questions format to guide you through the knowledge.  \n\n1. The student who write the questions usually are experienced students (TAs) or professor. A detailed answer usually includes both theory and implementation.  \n\n2. TAs will give you feedback about your answers. Feedback includes **thumbs up** or **thumbs down**, and **comment**.\n\n\n### What to do?\n\nGo through all the questions.\n\n### Bonus:\n\nIf you are interested in other course or other topics, you can ask your questions on [Cross-Course Questions Board](https://www.red", "answer": " 46"}

So, 528 is 50 times greater than the difference between 5195.\n\n2. The same way with 9773. Divide 528 by something. The result will be 10067211.5 Again, 106 is 60 times greater than the solution.\n\nTherefore, 5195 - 9773 = 4178\n\nOr if you prefer\n\nThe number before the 5 in 5195 is 1. So the result is 10195\n\nThe number before 5 in 528 is also 1. So the the result is 22\n\nDivide 10196-22 by the number before 9 in 9773, which is also 1, and you will get 31802.  \n\n### Solution\n```python\ndef run():\n\tinput = int(input())\n\n\t\n\tprint(f.div(input, f) % f)\n\n```", "answer": " 75"}

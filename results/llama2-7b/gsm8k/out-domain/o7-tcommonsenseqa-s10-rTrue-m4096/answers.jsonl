{"text": "Mark has 40 flowers in his garden\n\n### Rationale: (From a student)\n\n```\nIt is given that there are ten times less purple flowers than yellow flowers. So, since there are 80 % more yellow flowers, there are 80 * 10 = 800 purple flowers, which then account for 25 % of the garden. There are 25 % - 10% (taking into consideration the yellow flowers) of purple flowers in the garden. Mark has 800 - 100 = 700 purple flowers in his garden.\n```\n\n### Rational (From a teacher)\n\nYellow flowers are 3 times more than purple flowers.\n\n```\nTherefore there are 80(3/2) = 120 yellow flowers in the garden\n\nThere are 25% of yellow and purple flowers = 1:8\n\n$$25 - (4/3) \\times \\frac{100}{\\%}$$of Y and P flowers = (33.3 - 20)% of yellow, so 82.25% of Y and P flowers = 82.2% of Yellow flowers = 1:4.\n\n$$120 \\times \\frac{4}{10}$$ = 800\n$$1200 - (4/10) \\times \\frac{%}{100}$% = 800 - (10/100)% = 80 - 10%\n\nTherefore, there are 82.2 purple flowers and 1 yellow.\n\n82.2 = 16 + 64 + 4\n\nSo, the remainder is divided by 8 to find how many Y and P flowers, then the % of each colour is determined.\n\n74/8 = 9\n\n9 + 9.25 = 18.25 + 76.75 = 95.00\n\nThere are 82 yellow, 9 red, 83 pink and 90 purple flowers in total in the garden.\n```", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "The correct answer is $27.\n\nResponse Rationales:\n\n1. The key information is that a pound of creme cheese cost half the price of a pound of cheddar cheeses.\n\n2. This means the other half pound of cheese needs to be double the price of a quarter pound of the cheese.\n\n3. We can also notice that the costing of $10 for the ingredients means that there is a $10 difference between the ingredient costs. That $10 is exactly equivalent to two-thirds of the price of one pound of cheese for Jasper.\n\n4. So the two-thirds price can be doubled to account for $10 difference.\n\n5. Doing this calculation, the price for a pound of cheese which should be more in price than cheddar cheese is $27.

Her current monthly income with an additional $600 in salary is $2100.\n\nHer current monthly expenses are 25% which means $425.\n\nBy using a P/M problem, we find that Mrs Snyder spent half of her monthly income for rent and utilities ($750). Then, $425 is the other half which means, her rent and utilities are now $500 and her previous income was $1,000 to start (500 + 425 + 600 = 1,525).\n\nA rational can further be explained by comparing the two sets of proportions for the problem.\n\nThe first proportion in the problem states that Mrs Snyder\u2019s current monthly income was $2100 and her current expense is $425 which is 20% of her original income.\n\nHowever, the second ratio in the problem is that of her previous income and current expense.

{"text": "We can solve the problem using the equation: \n\nTotal cups of flour + Total teaspoons of \u00bd salt = C  \nTotal cups of water = C \u2013 C/2\n\n### Rationale: \n1. The word 'all' in the question refers to all of the ingredients together, not each ingredient individually. For example, if \"all cups\" refers to \"10 cups of flour and 16 cups water\", then the 1/2 salt is irrelevant because the 'all' refers all together.\n2. \"one half\" should be converted to a fraction. 1/2 = 0.5 (or 1/2), and then multiplied by 10. This means that we need 2 * (1/2) = 1 cup of salt for every 10 cups each of water and flour. 1/2 * 10 = 5 cups of salt. As this was stated, however, the number of cups is not a given, so we have to add the salt to the number of water and flour before we can find the resulting number of cups. 5 + C = C, and therefore C = 5 + C. 10 + C = C, so the original C was 10. \n3. We then plug the number 10 into the equation C = C \u2013 5/2, where C = Cups of water. Let's call this variable W, or W = C = C - 5. W + 5 = W \u2013 5/2 (i.e. W*(1 - the fraction 5/2)) then rearranging we get 7W = 5.( W = 7.5 cups of water) \n4. Now we will calculate the cups of salt needed, which is 2 * 1/2 = (1/2)(1/2) * teaspoons of sodium chloride, 50 teaspoons of Sodium chloride = 50/1 teaspoons, and (5 W * 50/1 = 250/1 teacups in total to serve in the making of the pizza.\n5.

For example, here may be a detailed method the writer used to answer this math problem, or a summary of these steps for easier understanding. \n\nA response can be no more than 5 lines long.\n\n### Solution:\n\nWe are given a total of 36 shells collected by Laurie and we know that 4 times the amount of shells were collected by Alan. Also, Ben started their trip late and only collected a third the amount of shells collected by Lauries. Ben's total amount of shells collected was 36 as well which means that Laurie had collected 3 times as many shells than Ben. \n\nSince Alan collected 4 times the amount as Ben, his answer is therefore 12 times more than Ben. Laurie collected a total of 3 times as many as Ben, so Ben's answer is 3 times as many. Add the two together, and we can conclude that Alan collected 15 shells more than Ben collected. \n\nThe overall math process involved to arrive at this solution is as follows. The first step is to determine that Alan collects 4 times as many shells to Ben. Since Ben has 36 shells and started a little late, he only took 1/3 the amount of shells as anyone else including Laurie. \n\nWe can also then determine that Laurie has 36 shell collection from the fact that 15+12+4+3 =36. Once this is determined, we know that the final answer is 15. \n\nHere is how we would break down each portion of this math problem.\n\n### Calculation: The first step involves determining the answer.\n\n1. Alan collected 4 times as many\n2. Ben has 36\n3. Laurie collected 3 times as much as Ben (36)\n4. You add all those numbers together and you come up with 15.

The future is not past. \nE) cannot be the answer because time will be traveling in reverse. \nNext we look at the questions that make sense, and try to eliminate them based on other relevant choices. We eliminate B) because the group has already traveled back in time.\nSince A, C, and D cannot be eliminated by the previous information, we analyze them further. We think that A) is impossible in this context because a group is usually the same number of people as the year (a year has 52 weeks after all) and C) is a little farfetched considering the context.\nFinally we know that D) is the answer because it is the only choice that makes sense in the context, and also fits the structure of the question.\nAnswer: D.\n\n---", "answer": " 46"}

This means that he sold $102.50 worth of cones.\n\n### Questions: Were he really did only $100 worth?\n\n### Instructor's Note:  Your goal is to determine if Dan truly sold only $100 value of cones or if he somehow came up with the needed number of free cones to make up for the shortfall.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. You can consider the cones and the customer as the transactions. In order to do free cone, the customer need to buy ice cream on cones.\n\n2. The customer will buy 88 cones.\n\n3. After considering all the customer, we can find out the value of the cones the customer bought.\n\n4. That value is $1960; If you consider it as a transaction, we do the equation like this:\n\n  1. The sum of customer's cones will be 88\n  2. The value of the cones will be 1960\n  3. The value of the transaction will be the sum of the cones multipliand by its value. That will be 19360\n\n5. This can be reduced to $1010, which is the value of his normal profits.\nSo, if he is really selling $100 worth, he will not have enough profits for all the customers to buy cones.  \nIf he can give free $100, he should have lost $20 since he couldn't have profits for the transaction. \nHowever, if he can give free $88 (because he will sell 88 cones for free and he just need to make more sales in order to compensate his lost) then he can actually have profits after all, and he will be able to cover all the free cones he gave away.\n\n\n### Task: Answer the following grade math question\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: In what form will you find energy after your trip to the gas station?

{"text": "Since it grows longer each year, this is the tree's final year growing long. \n\n### Explanation:\nIn order to solve for T, the total amount of time a tree grows 100 meters we need to use what we're given in the problem:  It will grow 110% more than last year. This is just 10% but now compounded.\n\n### Exponential vs. Normal Telescoping\nA simple way to understand the difference between exponential functions (like this problem) and linear function (normal tesloncoping) is that you can only use the exponential function for times that are greater than one. For instance, when dealing with a normal telescoping problem from 2009 until 2019 we would say 9 years because normal telescoping, by definition, never goes beyond \"1\"\n\n### Rules of Exponential Function Telescoping Problems\n- For all exponential functions: \n\n$$x^n$$\n\n1. We always use the last year as an \"n\" when solving for T, the time until X grows to the next n.\n    \n2. Since time is constant, we can say x = 100 since the x we\u2019re solving for at any given year will never change.\n    \n### How do you get from a year's value to T?\n\n$$T = x_n$$\n\n- Given problem: We are asked how long the tree has grown from the end of 2917 to the end of 2819.\n\n$T = X_n$ - We now know that the tree began to grow at the end of 17 and grows long 10% more each year \n\nThe first set of numbers we must have to solve for \"T\" is the year and the amount of growth each year.\n\n$X = 100$ \n\n- We can now subtract 100 from each year\n\n$$100 \u2013 X_1$$\n\n$$110 \u2013 X_2$$\n\n$$121 \u2013 X_3$$\n\n$$132 \u2013 X_4$$\n\n$$143 \u2013 X_5$$\n\n$$165 \u2013 X_6$$\n\n$$188 \u2013 X", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "Dad caught seven trout.\n\n## Hints: \n1. When one person catches two of the same thing, and another person catches more, they have to factor the greater number of catches in order to determine how much more one person caught compared to the other. Remember: there are more trouts in the total catches of one person compared to another person.\n2. Also, when one person catches an item X, and another person catch catches 3X, what is the factor? That person caught 3X.\n3. When both people catch X and Y, 3X and 7Y, 7Y is a multiple of 3X. (You can look it up).\n4. Therefore, you would divide 3X by 7Y (multiplied by 2) and then subtract that number from the total to calculate the difference between Caleb's catch and his dad's catch, which equals three.\n\n## Answer Key\n1. **A:** Correct. The statement has four parts for the listener to evaluate.\n\n**ELIMINATOR**: \"The sun does not rise\" \u2013 This must be true, because for the sun to rise, it _must_ rise and not set.\n\n**RATIONALS**: \"And sets 8 hours earlier on the other side of the planet\" \u2013 The sun does not set and the sentence is irrelevant as to what the listener is supposed to be wondering.\n\n**EVALUATION**: \"It will never be visible during the night on either side of the planet\"\n\n2. **B:** Correct.

The listener's confusion is irrelevant to the rest of the sentence, which is in fact a rhetorical statement that provides evidence for a statement that is not being presented. The listener is only guessing what the speaker has presented.\n\n4. **D:** The sentence is not a statement; it is a question without an interrogation point. The question will not have a straightforward response, because the answer to such a question is subjective.\n\n5. **C:** This is a rhetorical sentence.

{"text": "6 cents\n\n### Analysis:\nThe task asks us to calculate the amount of money Hannah has left. The options given are '$50' and '16 dollars'. So, we can eliminate '$50' as the correct answer from the beginning because it is too high and '$16' is obviously not correct and should be eliminated as well.\n\nNext, we consider Hannah needs to spend $13.5 to purchase 2 sets of measuing spoons. So, we cross out the options corresponding to a price of $13.5 or less.\n\nConsidering Hannah has sold cookies worth $72, we can rule out the possibility of a price under $6, as $72 is less than $6 multiplied by 40, and it is obvious that she does not have money left of more than $6. So, we can cross out the remaining options of $4 and lesser.\n\nNow all we have to do is calculate the sum of her selling prices for both cookies and cupcakes. Therefore, the answer that fits the context is '0+30+0.4+26+4*1.6-13.5' which boils down to '$0.8+30.4+0.4+16+64-13.5'. We can eliminate 30.4 from the list as it is not a multiple of $0.8 which we can easily find using the division 13.5/$13.5 = 1*0.8 = 0.8.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $0.8.", "answer": " 79"}

To determine the correct answer, we first need to understand the statement itself. It states that the speaker used to do ballet but now does not want to dance a single more step. The phrase'single step' indicates that we are talking about a single move, such as a pirouette or a jump. This implies that the speaker used to take many steps now. In other words, she no longer takes as many moves as before.

So the amount of rain for the first 15 day is **60 in**, because **4*5 = 60**\n\nFor the second 15 days it stated that it rained twice the number of inches.

Hence, Michael earned a total of 1440 dollars.\n\n### Discussion:\nThe main idea of this task is to calculate the cost of each painting and then the total amount earned from the sales. To do this, we first need to identify the prices charged for small and large paintings. This can be done by noting the price of each painting, which indicates an overall value. The question then asks us to find the total amount earned from those sales. To do so, we multiply the number of each type of painting sold by the associated price. This gives us the total amount earned from each type of painting. Finally, we find the total amount earned at the show by adding the amounts earned from each painting size.\n\n\n\n[Previous](../09_05_Practice/Reading)_ [Next](../10_01_Riddles/Complete_the_riddle_on_the_next_page)", "answer": " 1140"}

{"text": "Coco could not use up to 25 hours for the total number of hours he used his oven because he does not have 25 hours of electricity use. 2 hours is all he can use if he does not exceed the daily limit.\n\n### Rationale: Coco can only use his oven for a total of 16.8 hours. It is possible to have up to 17 hours worth of oven usage so that he would only exceed the electrical limit by 30 seconds. But, what is really the maximum amount of hours that he can use is 2 hours plus 17 minutes. 2 hours plus 45 minutes will be close to 16 hours but this is not possible. Therefore, Coco cannot afford to use up to the maximum amount of hours.\n\n### Response2: The maximum amount of hours he can use is 17 hours because he can only use up to 20 hours worth of electricity for a day.\n\n###Rationale: To solve the problem, we need to calculate the maximum amount of hours he could use, assuming that the electricity price is the same for all hours. For the hours that he uses the oven, the kilowatt-hours are calculated by applying the consumption rate of 2 kWh to the number of hours used.\n\nThe maximum amount of hours he is allowed to use for the month depends on the number of hours he used last month, assuming the same electricity price. \n2Kwh (kilowatt-hour) = 2.4 hours\nThe maximum amount of 20 hours worth electricity is applied to the number of hours he uses last month.\nUsing the above formula: 20 + 16.8 = 36.8 hours\n\nUsing the above formula once again, we apply the formula to a maximum possible use of 25 hours:\n25 + 16.5 = 41.5\n\nIf we compare our result from the first formula with the result from the second formula we see that the difference is 4.7, which means that the difference in the result is insignificant.\n\n###Response3: The maximum amount of minutes he can use is 540 minutes because the price for electricity doesn't increase. Therefore, to spend more hours, he would need to spend more money.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "A solution to the task is to first determine how many complete furniture sets are left. There are 5 legs on each of the chairs and 3 legs on each table. Hence, 5 tables are required to have 80 chairs. That means 45 tables are damaged. So, 60 tables are left (5 tables + 55 tables = 60 tables). 60 tables (complete sets) are required to have 200 legs. Hence, 210 legs are left (20 tables + 190 legs = 210 legs). So, 320 legs are used or damaged (350 legs - 210 legs): 140 legs. Then, 8 tables (40%) out of 20 tables are damaged. 40% of 60 or all sets are 24 tables. Then, 30 tables (complete sets containing all legs) are still left (24 tables + 6 tables = 30 tables). Thus, the solution is 60 legs (8 tables) x 4 (legs in a table). Thus, there are 240 legs left (140 legs + 100 legs). So, the total number of legs the company has left is 240.\n\n### Rationales: 1) The question asks how many legs the company has now after the damage. \n\n2) This is because the question is worded in the context of the company and its own furniture.\n\n3) We know that 60 tables were left and 40% of that is 24 tables.\n\n4) We also know that 30 tables were left and they contain 4 legs each for 120 legs. \n\n5) Hence, we need to combine the 120 legs (from the 30 tables) and the 240 legs (from the other 24 tables) to get 360 legs.\n\n6) This tells us that the total legs left in their company are 360 legs (120 legs + 240 legs).\n\n### Input for a similar question:\nI was born in Seattle, a friend of mine was born in Austin, we met in LA, I had lunch on Santa Monica beach", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "Answer: $14\n\n### Brief Instructions: \n1. Find a calculator\n- In order to verify that the output is correct the question must be written in a way that calculable answers can be derived.\n\n### Rationale:\n## 1. The first step is to list out the given variables. In this case there is a fixed monthly income, a fixed monthly cost for necessities, and an unknown monthly tax payment.\n\n3. The first rule is to write the given in a systematic equation in the form of an equation. As such:\n$$x=\\frac{c+m}{n}$$\nWhere $c$ represents necessities, $m$ represents taxes and $n$ represents income. In this question $c+m=(42+250)$ which represents the given contribution. In this case, the given contribution to taxes must be subtracted. Since:\n$$m=\\frac{n-c}{n}$$\nWith this representation of the given it's possible to find more variables. $u=c+x$ will satisfy the equation where $u$ will be known at the end of the question.\n\n4. Substituting the values for $x$ in the expression of $u$ reveals a useful result from the equation.\n$$$u=\\left(\\frac{(80 \\times 250 \\times 12)+42}{80}\\right)$$\nHowever, one can easily recognize that the value of the variables is already known and so the values are now known. The only unknown variable is $n$, or the taxes.\n\n### 5. Reasoning: Since it's obvious the given is correct, this is the only part of the calculation we would need to double check. Since: \n\n$$n=\\frac{u-42}{80}$$\nThe value must be divided by 80 because the question only includes the amount of money remaining. In the question:\n```txt\n\nThe question now reads:\nAngie is part of the household with shared expenses who contributes $42 to shared necessities and a salary of $50. She pays a share of the taxes, and at the end of the month has $0.68 remaining. How much did she contribute?\n```\nAnd so it would be possible for her", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "$460.75\n\n### \n### Analysis:\nThe fine is increased by 2 for every mile per how over the speed limit is 75 miles per an hour over the speed limit, which is 55 miles per hour over. From the second question, we deduce that the fine per mile per hour is 3. So, $50+ (x+y), where x is the charge for each mile over the speed limit and y is the charge for driving in a school zone. That is $50+ (55+3), which is, $50+58. From the third question, we learn that he got an additional charge of 300. Finally, we see $80/hour. So, the charge is $50+176+300+80, which is 50+306, which is $356+$ 46. So, the answer is $460.5.\n### Comment: This question requires deductive reasoning as well as logical computation.

{"text": "She originally had $100 in her bank. After spending half of the amount on a toy, she had 51 dollars left. Then she spent half of this money and bought her brother's book. So, the original amount of money she had must be multiple of 51. It can't be a number that is less than $51. So, the amount of money could have been $100 or $200. We can then use the information that, for the first spending, Isabel had to spend exactly half of the money to buy a toy. So, in her head, she has 100 divided by 2 = 50, and she only has 51 dollars left in her bank. So, that's 51 minus 50 = 1. She could have bought a 1 dollar or more toys, but she bought a toy that cost exactly 50 dollars. It's only this amount that she has exactly 10 dollars left in her head. So, this is the minimum possible amount that she spent. If she had spent double this amount, 100 dollars, then she would have had exactly 10 dollars to spare in her bank.

The correct answer is to write C and then explain and justify your answer.\n\nIf all 500 customers visited Village Foods at least one every other day and purchased only produce from them, then a total of 100 would spend a minimum of $2 each day. When there were four vegetables sold each day we can figure $1.40 per customer per day as well as $2.10 worth of tomatoes sold. On a day with five customers purchasing four tomatoes a day, we know they spent $1.50 and on 900 customers, we have a total of $1,230 worth of them.

Hence, we know that the weight of potatos sold for whole day is\n\n7 x 46 (m - a) kg\n\n### Final:\n\nWe get the following answer: 425 kg\n\n### Explain:\n\nThe calculation here is simple:  We know that the number of bags of mashed potatoes sold in morning is m, and the number of bags sold for the afternoon is a.\n\nWe know that the total weight of mashed potatoes is equal to the product of the weight of the mashed potatoes (7kg) and the total number of bags of sold (46 in total).\n\nSo, then we just need to know the total number sold to get the total weight sold.\n\nHowever, it is given that in the morning m bags of mashed poutatoes were sold and in the afternoon a bags of mashed peatotos were sold.\n\nTherefore, we can say that the amount of bag sold = \\((m-a)\\)\n\nSo, the number of bags = \\((m-b)\\)\n\nThe product of the weight of mashed mashed potatoes and the total number of sold bags yields \\((7x(m-a))\\)\n\nIt is also given that each bag of mashed potatos has 7kg of weight.\n\nTaking this information and simplifying our expressions we could write:\n\n7x(m-b) = 46\n\nDivide both sides by 46 and we get \\((5x(m-a)+46) = 7x(m-h)\\)\n\nMultiply to", "answer": " 322"}

{"text": "First, consider that \"exercising\" is a general term that could refer to a variety of activities. So, it's important to clarify which exact exercise was involved. \n\nFor example, one activity could involve working out with light weights and performing repetitions. But this one might not be very strenuous and can be resumed after a few days. Another activity could involve working out very hard or performing very difficult moves, especially with weightlifting. This type of activity will probably last longer and will require more time to recover. \n\nSo, James could have injured himself when doing hard training, or could have injured himself by pushing himself too hard and doing something wrong. \n\nIn which case, we would need to use a different procedure and a different timeframe. So, let's assume that he hurt himself while doing hard training. \n\nThe first important parameter is James' baseline strength. This is what it'll take for him to be able to perform this activity hard again. \n\nThe second important time parameter is the time it took for the injury to actually heal after its initial recovery. The injury had subsided in 3 days, but James wants to wait for 5 days before he'll be able to start working out again. This suggests it also took him 5 days for him to reach a new baseline state again. \n\nSo after another 1 day of rest, 2 days of gentle training, 5 days of training and 1 day of rest again, James should be close to his baseline strength again. But he should not start doing difficult training yet, as it takes quite some time for his injury to fully heal. \n\nThis will then take a total of 5*2 = 10 days to fully recover. \n\nNext, consider that James wants to wait another 3 weeks to really get back to working out. This is the same amount of time he wanted to wait to start gentle training again. \n\n3 weeks will then be the amount of time it takes for James to get to baseline strength again, plus the 2 days of the recovery period once he starts doing hard training again. This is James' new baseline performance. \n\nJames can then gradually increase the intensity of the training that he does until he reaches the old performance. This should take about 7 weeks (5*2 + 7*2) from the time", "answer": " 39"}

{"text": "Clover walks a total of 90 miles in 30 days.\n\n### Rationales: We begin with the initial statement. We know from the statement that Clover has a habit of walking 1.5 miles every day over 30 days, so we'll just consider the situation in parts and calculate the overall distance covered. 1. The first statement gives us an idea for the frequency. Clover walks 1.5 miles, twice in every day. 2. The second statement tells us about the duration, which is 30 days. 3. Thus, we get the distance covered by Clover due to his daily walking habit, which is 1.5 miles \u00d7 1.5 miles/ mile/ day\u00d730 days= 30 miles. 4. Finally, we add 30 miles (obtained from step 3) with the initial given statement of 1.5 miles of daily walking. There will be a total of 45 miles added to the distance already covered. 5. But, considering the frequency, we can say 45 miles is covered in two days, which means Clover walks a distance of 22.5 miles each day. 6. Now, we add this to the distance covered initially by Clover. Thus, we get a total of 47.5 miles so far. But, remember, we have considered the frequency only twice on the total duration of 30 days. This means that the distance covered in 30 days is 30 days (for every second) multiply this with 2.5 (from frequency), which is 75 miles. So, Clover walks a combined total of 122.5 miles in the duration of 30days. 7. Thus, the correct answer is, 122.75 (rounded to the nearest multiple of 0.1) which is a total of 123 miles.\n\n### Input I:How many kilometers is the distance from Canada to India?\n\n### Rationale: The distance from Canada to India is 15712 kilometers.\n\n### Step 1: Initial question statement - how far is it from Canada to India? \n\n### Step2: From the given choices, we can eliminate options C, D and E. \nOut of", "answer": " 90"}

{"text": "Janet's own dogs (1/17 of total) + Janet's own cats (1/17*10 of total) == 1/17+1/170 = 18/170\n\n### Rationales:\n\nFirst we need to understand the ratios for Heloise's pets: 10:1(7), meaning 10:1 of the total number (189).\n\nAfter that the rest of the questions are relatively straightforward.\n\nWe need to give 10 dogs (55) for Janet's dogs (1/10 of 189), plus an additional 55 for Janet's cats (1/55 of 189). Now we have Heloise: 17/55 (10/55 - 6/55-1/55). So Janet gets 1/17th of Heloise's dogs.\n\nSimply add Janet's 55 to Heloise's 17 to find how many dogs Heloise has left.\n\n### Input and Answer:Jonathan was waiting for his favorite singer to perform and the singer was 1 hour late from the planned time.

The first step is to figure out what information is given first and what we can assume from the question itself.\n2. We have an input:Carrie wants to  buy  a new  iPhone. And we note that that means there is $800 difference between the old phone cost (which we don't know) and the new phone cost.\n3. We can then conclude that the new phone cost is $800 dollars.\n4. Based on the input, we then see that we need to get to $800 with $620 dollars. So, we need to make $80.\n5. So we see that babysitting is the only way to raise $80 per week.\n6. There are 52 weeks in a year.\n\n1. If we assume that it is one week per dollar. This may not work because our number is not divisible by 5.\n\n2. But we can multiply it by 2 and get \n\n  $$1 week = \\frac{64}{1000}$$.\n\n$1000$ means 10000$.\n\n3. Since, if we divide 52 into 800 we do not arrive at a sensible number.

Choices: \nA: dog B: hose C: fountain D: pump E: nozzle\nRationales: The question asks who would use a spray to clean a pond. We can eliminate D: pump as no pump would need or even have a spray. The choices left are A: dog, B: hose, C: fountain, and E: nozzle. Hose (B) is in the wrong place as per the context and the spay is used to clean a pond, not a hose. Nozzle (E) is not to clean the pond but to spray water. Therefore, it is not a valid answer option. Option C: fountain is also wrong as fountain spray water and not clean the pond. Therefore, what we are left with are choices A: dog and C: fountain. \n\nNow, think about it. While a dog could also clean a pond, there are other animals that could also clean the pond like horses, cattle, etc. Therefore, this choice is too generic and could also refer to cows or horses.\n\nThis leaves us with a very limited choice between A: dog and C; fountain. It is possible that the fountain could be cleaned by the dog but in this case 'use' would have to be done by humans or children as it appears that the fountain is a decorative feature. If it was not, more likely it would be a pump or a hose that would be used.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C: fountain; however, you will learn from other similar questions that 'use' does not always have a logical meaning.", "answer": " 375"}

Since Toby has $15 in his change bag, and he needs a total of $95, he needs to add the remaining $80 which is the total of money collected to fund his shoes. \nFirst, he can save $15 (his monthly allowance) and $36 (mowed lawns, $15) in his savings account, which gives him a total of $51 ($15+$15+36). Next, he can shovel 2 yards for $7 each. He can also mow 2 lawns for $15. To get to his $51, he needs to mow 1 yard and shovel 1 yard. He can then use what's left to buy his shoes.  To arrive at the right answer, you just need to use the right mathematical logic to determine the number of yards and lawns.\nAnswer: 4 lawns and 3 driveways\n\n### Input 2:A student scored 25 points off 50 in the exam.

Also, reprimanding may not be useful for this situation. \n\nStep 2 : Next, it is suggested to call Jeffery with his bad news.

{"text": "She started with 58 sentences today.\n\n### Justification:\nThe key to this is a technique called cross-multiplication. To solve this problem, the first step is to find the difference between the number of sentences Janice types and the number sentences she started with:\n536-58=478\nSo, this means her work started with 478 sentences.\n\nThe next step is to find how many sentences Janice types in 20 minutes:\n6 * 20 = 120\n\nWe can multiply 478 by 20 to find how many sentences she typed in all:\n478 * 20 =964\n\nWe can multiply this number by 120 to find how much faster she can type:\n964 * 120=115280\n\nNow, to find how many sentences were erased we can divide 11528 by 18 (the times she typed afterwards the meeting):\n11528/18=647.78\n\nNow, we know that Janice erased 40 of those sentences, this means that the work started with 647.76 sentences. Since she started out with 478, this means she needed 169.76 more sentences to fill up her work today. Let's subtract that from the amount she finished with:\n533.76-169.78=364\n\nThis means she started with 364.\n\nSo, the correct answer is that she started with 356.", "answer": " 258"}

{"text": "### Rational :\nThe answer to this question is C. The first chapter is done as it is finished at Four. Hence, the remainder of chapter 11 is done minus 10 pages. Then, 2 more chapters are done to finish the book after 4PM after having done chapter 11. The total time spent to complete each chapter is 40 + 40 = 80 minutes. The time taken to complete chapter 11 is 40 - 10 = 30 minutes. So, the total time spent is 80+30=110 minutes to finish the work.\nHence, the answer is C.\n### Rational:\nThe answer is a combination of the first two answers, A and B. As it is mentioned that she read more than ten chapters by the Four clock. Hence, there is a chance that she would still be reading beyond 4. If that's the case, it is less than 10 pages. It is less than 20 pages because chapter eleven was 2 times that chapter. So, to find the amount of pages, add the previous two answers.\n\n### Rational 3:\nThe answer is A. Since it is written that'she read ten chapters', we should not add the chapter from where she left. This is where we get the answer that she will finish the first chapter that will be 10 pages. The first 10 pages from the second chapter will have 20 pages as Chapter 11. The second two chapters will have a total of 60. \n\n### Rationale 4:\nThe answer is clearly B. In the 4th chapter, when the 20th page of the 11 chapter is reached, which means she won't read that many pages that day. She will only have the book in time to read 10 pages.

{"text": "8 stickers are left.\n\n### Rationale:\nReasoning:\nThe answer is 8. To prove this, we can create a chart of who got how many stickers and then use it to determine the 8 remaining stickers.\n\nThe first 4 stickers each went to 3 of Colton's friends. Then the next sticker added 5+5=10 to Mandy, Colton's friend. That makes a total of 14 stickers.\nThat also means that the 72 minus the remaining 14 is 58 stickers.\n58 stickers divided evenly by 10 remaining is 5.8 stickers, rounded down to 5.\n\nThose 5 stickers are then distributed back and forth between Colton's three friends. And 1 is left over.\n\nStep 1- Colton starts with 72 dolphins\nStep 2- Colton gave 4 stickers to each of his other 3 friends. So 3 stickers were lost with each new friend he added to his sticker collection.\nStep 3- Colton ends up deciding that he wants to give Mandy 2 more dolphins. 1 more than he gave to his other 3 friends total\nStep 4- After Mandy gets her 2 MORE stickers, Colton then gives Justin 10 less stickers, which means he gives Mandy 2 MORE than he gave to his friends.\nStep 5- When Colton is finished giving everyone their stickers, he ends with 72 - 14 - 5 = 58.\n\nStep 6- 58 stickers divided by 10, results in 5.8 stickrs remaining\n\nStep 7- 5.8 stickrers divided by 1 = 5.8\n-Rounded Down to 5 stickers, Colton had left over\n\nStep 8- 5 stickers divided by 3 = 1.66 stickers and after rounding down to 1.5 each, for each of his 3 friends\n\nStep 9- So 1 more is left.

{"text": "The answer is E: 66 pizzas\n\n### Demostration:\n1. We can see that Jimmy only has 7 hours to make the 67 pizzas, which means he makes each pizza in 5 minutes.\n2. If the pizzas need 0.5kg flour each, then we can say that 67 pizzzas need about 33.5kg. \n3. At this point, we can apply the formula for how much is left: X - Y = Z, where X is the total amount (33.5kg) we need to make 67 pizzies, Y is the amount we actually used (7kg), and Z is the amount of flour left.\n4. This means that 33.5 - 7 = 26.5kg is left.\n5. If we add this amount (26.5kg) to each additional pizza Jimmy makes, and we find the amount is 0.5kg.\n6. Therefore we can deduce that Jimmy can make another 66 pizzys.\n\nAnswer: He can make a total of 66 pizzazs.\n\n### Input :Sally is having a party to which there are 78 people.

Choices: 1: 0 2: 1 3: 2 4: 3 5: 4\nRationales: The question is simple, but tricky. To determine how many times it can be carried on, we first have to understand how to add. To add, we take three digits, such as in the example, 13 and 14, and we add them. This equals to the number 27. Here we need to find out how many times 27 can be carried on. So we will add a sum of three digits, such as 13 + 14 which equals to 183.  In 183 we multiply 1, then 10 times, so 8 + 80 + 800 = 907. Then, 27 is repeated 3 times. Then we have 0-1+6=6 So, the answer is 0+1+2+3+6 = 12 (as we have to keep carrying 1's) To find out how many times it can carried on, we add 14 with 12. This equals up to 28. So, we keep repeating 2's up to a sum of 14. So, the answer is two times seven, which is fourteen. The answer is fourteen, with a plus sign. \nThe options that are incorrect, 4 and 5, should be considered incorrect, because they do not add up to eleven. Option 2, adds up to three, not fifteen.

{"text": "The company mixes 2 bags of gravel for each truck of asphalt, so each truckload of asphalt has 10 bags of gravel in it. Each mile of road that they pave requires 3 truckloads of aspha \n### Rationales:First of all, the roadwork company uses a mixture of pitch and a mixture of gravel and asphalt to make their asphalt, so we are not adding in any barrels of pitch. The company mixes two bags of gravil for each truckload of their asphalt. Second of all, the company uses three truckloads of the asphalt to cover a mile. Next of all, each truck of aspha requires five bags of gravel, and one bag of gravel for every mile of road, so you can see that the company uses 10 bags with each truckload of road asphalt. In the third line, the company puts down 4 miles a day, then a mile less than double that, so 4 times a day, times 3 truckloads a day, plus a mile, times 4. And after figuring the number of barrels of asphalt that they would normally need, they still need 8 more barrels of asphal for the remaining roadwork.\n### Answer: Each truck loads of asphalt uses 10 bats of gravel, and paves 3 truckloads per mile of road. So each mile of road paved requires 30 bags of graville, and 15 bags of gravel per truck load of asphalt. The third day they 4 miles, and 30 bags times 4 is 120. The company needs to add 80 barrels of aspha, or 1 bag of asphalt equals 5 bags of gravil.\n### Input: You are an employee of a fast food restaurant making $7.25 an hour.

Choices:  B: co worker C: fellow employee D: subordinate E: executive\nRationales: In the first task, we were required to find the person who is referred to as the 'friend of the boss' and then select that person by name from the given choices.\n\nStep 1 Identify the question and the main characters: From the sentence, we see that the words 'friend of the bosh' describe someone in the organization 'office'. Next, we identify the central actors in the sentence as boss and friend.\nStep 2 Analyze the available choices and eliminate irrelevant ones: Now, we begin by eliminating the irrelevant choices. The question we are analyzing is about the 'friend of the bos' and the options given are: co worker, subordinate, fellow employee, executive, and boss. Notice that boss (A), co worker (B), and subordinate (D) contain the prefix 'work'. This indicates that the actors are all working professionals, but not friends. They may know each other but they are not exactly friends.\nStep 3: Identify the correct answer: Now, we use the clues in the sentence relating to friendship to eliminate the irrelevant options. Consider the sentence: The boss is referred to as 'friend of the b' and his friend is referred to as '...'. Does this indicate that the boss and his friend are close by any stretch of meaning? Yes, this is an indication that there is a bond of friendship established between the people talked about.\nStep 4 Choose the correct answer from the remaining options: This is how we eliminate B and C from our choice of answers. Hence, we are left with option D: fellow employee. The correct answer is D: fellow employee.\n\n### Input and Demonstration: Fatima's weight decreased by two, what was her weight before?

This tells us Kenny was practicing and running for 10hours each.\n\nThe question says Kenny is practicing the trumpet 2 times the basketball length as well. This means Kenny played 3 hours of trumpet.\n\nThus, we can conclude Kenny's trumpet practice time is 3 hours.\n\nNow, we have the trumpet practice time + the basketball length. \n\nThis works out to be 13 hours for Kenny's basketball exercise and trumpet practice.\n\nWe can then see Kenny has used his week for 13 2/5 hours of sports and 2/5 hours for the trumpet.\nThe correct answer would thus be: 2.25\n\n### Response 2:\nDetailed analysis:\nBasketball: 5.75 hours.\nTime Kenny ran and practiced the trumpet:  5.75 x 2 = 11.5 hours.\nNumber of hours Kenny practiced the trump and basketball: 13.75.\nNumber of hours in total practicing and playing sports: 25.75.\nKenny's time used in practicing and sports: 25 2/5 hours.\nThe total number of hours in the week is 75 hours.\nWe now subtract the sports and trumpet timings mentioned above to determine the time left unused.\nThe answer would be 50.25 hours.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "Yasna can read 180 pages per day and 100 pages per day 25% of the time or 29 days\n\n### Rationale:If Yasna reads an equal number of page every day, then the following relationships should hold:\n\n1. Yasna needs to read 100 pages every day for the 20th day and for 30 pages every day for 30 days and finally, 100 pages for 28 days, where we read two days after the 20th as the remaining pages are 180 and 219 for a period of 29 days as we are multiplying by (1/2) to give us the remaining pages for the 11th day.\n\n2. Yasna needs 180 pages for the 20 days as we know Yasna only reads 100 pages and the 20th and 30th day. In this case we have, 30 * (1 /2 ) + 180 = 31 * (1 /2) which is equal to 180. This allows us to take off the 180 pages from the remaining pages and we have 100 * (1 / 2) for 28 days.\n\nFrom this, we can derive the following: When we add the time to the days we need to read the 100 pages, we can read 100 * 1 /2 + 20 days\n\n### Input :A car needs to go 670km to get to the destination.

That would be $500 for either 200 or 300 miles. It should be 200 miles because $600 will buy more miles, so we are looking for $600 for 250 miles. $600 for one hundred miles, $200 for each 50 miles, is an option but is less likely because 50 miles more would cost more, but $300 for a hundred miles would cost half the previous price, so its most likely.\n\n### Response:$200 for 1 mile and $500 for $300 miles = $300 for $250 miles\n\n## Question 4\n\nYou are on the 5th floor of an office building.

However, the first question lacks the correct context but the question in the third question includes a context of 'perfumes' in the question statement. Therefore, it is an indication where the answer may fit into.\nAlso, in the first question, the answer was'smooth skin'. Skin care is related to smell so that kind of smell may also be related to the skin. It is still possible that 'fresh smell' has nothing to do with perfume. It may still mean fresh smell related to skin care or skin smells but,'smooth skin' makes better sense for perfume.\n\nInput : How can you get a pizza on a train?\n\nDemetration :\n\nDifferent trains in different countries offer different service on board but most trains will have a food cart serving snacks, meals, and drinks.

Since zoo employee would have recovered 2 rhinos in 1 hrs and 1 rhino in 2.hrs, total time spend by zoo employee in recovering animals would be 3hrs.(1hr recovering two rhinos and 2 hrs recovering one rhino). Hence working zoo employee would be recovering the 1 rhino for the next 1.5hrs.

{"text": "Average number of leaves falling per hour = ((3+4)\u00f72)/3 = 3.33\n\n### Rationale\n\nA. Since hour 0 has no observed data, we can just ignore it and assume that the first hour has no leaves. \nB. Using the formula for finding the average value from a given set of values, we get: $${\\rm Average} = {\\frac{Total \\ number \\ of \\ leaves}{Total \\ number \\ of\\ hours}}$$\nC. For total # of leaves, we get: ${8 \\over 4} \\cdot 8 \\approxeq 16$\nD. For total # of hours, we get: ${3 \\over 2} = 1.5$ hours\nE. We apply the formula: ${16 \\over 1.5} = 10.63$\nF.

{"text": "#### Demonstration:1, The question asks how many hours Jeff spends working and catching up in each week.\n#### Rationale 1\n 1. We begin with the weekend when Jeff spends three times as much time catching up with his pals as he does at work. We have 3 hours of catch-up and four hours of work giving us a total of 7 hours.\n 2. Now, let\u2019s consider how many hours he spends on the weekdays when he spends four times the amount of time working as he does in catching up. It is Monday through Friday so we have 11 hours of work but only 2.5 hours of catch-up.\n 3. This gives us a total of 13.5 hours of work and catch-up which equals 7 hours which means we have 6.5 hours left to be accounted for.\n#### Rationale2\n 2. 6.5 hours is half of 13.4 hours which translates into 6.5 hours of 13. There are 13 parts of the hour. Hence, he spends 6.5 hours a day working.\n#### Proposal\n#### Proposal2\n#### Rationale 3\n 3. Jeff spends 6.75 hours (working & catch-up) in total or 3.35 hours a typical non-working day.\n#### Rationale4\n 4. If Jeff spends 3 hours a day on Fridays during work hours, that would constitute 15 hours total which is the entire week. This can only happen on Fridays. Hence, Jeff does not go to work on Fridays.\n#### Rationale5\n 5. Since Jeff does not go to school on Fridays, he will be free from Friday noon until Sunday morning which constitutes Saturday and Sunday. He catches up 3 hours on Fridays, 3 hours on Saturdays and 3 hours on Sundays, thus consuming the remainder 4 hours. This makes the total hours 13 hours and 15 hours divided by 3 gives 13.5, in line with the proposal.\n\n#### Conclusion\n#### Conclusion 1\n 1) The conclusion is that Jeff works 6.5 working hours per day.\n\n### Input : They'", "answer": " 62"}

So multiply 220 by 3 and divide by 22. we get 60 minutes.\n\n### Solution:450 minutes.\n\nThis is the complete solution.\n\n### Challenge:\n\nFind the correct solution for the below question.\n\n## Solved Question\n\nInput: One of the ingredients used for a muffin is eggs. The muffin is a baked item. The egg is a food. Muffin = item, food. The verb 'to make' means 'to prepare.'\nRationales: If you take the input above, ask the following questions:\n\n1. Is the question a question?\n2. In what relation does \"One\" refer to other terms in the question?\n3. What is the difference between a'verb' and an 'adverb' and a 'noun'?\n4. What do we mean by 'to be'?\n\nThe first part of the question is a question, because of the use of inverted commas. So it should be answered 'Yes'. The second part of the question indicates that 'One' refers to 'Muffin'. The \"the\" in \"Muffin\" refers to Muffin, as nouns always refer to nouns.\n\nThe difference between a verb and an adverb is that verbs are used to express action (I am running), while adverbs are used to express a modifier (I am happily running, with a smile). They also express various other functions; however, verbs are limited to expressing action when it should be used. However, this is not the only function of a verb; verbs are also used to express other things in the English language as defined by context.\n\nThe verb \"to make\" means to create or prepare something out of something else. Here, it implies preparing a muffin. So, the answer to the question \"What does the verb 'to make' signify?\" is \"preparation\".\n\nThe above information is insufficient to answer the question; now, we need to further dissect the meaning of \"inverted commas\"", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "The candy bar costs a total of 56 cents. First, determine the cost of coins. In the initial configuration, John's change is 12 cents (4 quarters, 4 dimes, and 4 nickels), so the cost of the coins is 12 c\nThe candy bar then costs 44 cents. The candy bar costs 44 c plus the cost of coins, so the cost of the candy bar is 56 cents\n\n### Justification:\n\nThe cashier gives customers their change from their purchase at the store. They will generally give customers either exact change based on how much their purchase cost or change based on the nearest dollar, known as \"dealing in rounds\"\n\nJohn paid 96 cents for the candy bar: 4 quarters, then 3 dimes, then a nickel. After paying for the candy bar, John received 12 cents back in change, four quarters, four dimes, and four nickels. This means John paid 96 c and received 12 c back in change. After subtracting both, John spent 84 c.\n\n44 c (cost of coins) + 84 c (cost of candy bar) is 128 c, but it must equal 96 c to account for the fact John paid 96. If 96 is subtracted from 128, 32 c can be deducted and the result is 84 c, the candy bar's cost. By looking at the change, we can see that John bought the candy bar for 96 c and that 84 c remained after paying for it\n\n### Input 2:\n\nIf John paid 4 quarters (25 c each) for the candy bar while waiting in line, John would have to pay 98 c for the candy bar. The extra 2 c can be explained by the change made for a total of 9 c (56 - 44 c). The candy bar then costs:\n\n96(25) + 2 c + 4 c(4)\n\n= 96(25 cents) + 2 cents + 4(25 cents cents)", "answer": " 131"}

{"text": "In order to answer this question, you must first understand all of the ingredients that compose the pepperoni pizza. From what I have been able to discern from research, pepperoni pizza contains four main ingredients: cheese, tomato sauce, pepperoni, and crust.\nFurthermore, I have also gathered that pepperoni, being a meat-based topping, is typically cut into slices ranging in size from 9x7 to 12x12 inches and approximately 1/2 inch thick (assuming that it is a pizza with all of these ingredients).\n\n### Demostration:\n\nThe number of slices in a halved pizza is the amount that is cut off the original pizza. Since half of a pizza (8 halves) is removed from the original pizza, that would mean that the pizza you start with would have 32 slices. Each of those slices is made up of four ingredients, so we can calculate: 32(4).\n\nEach of those slices is halved into two slices, which is then halved into 4 slices and Jelly receives one of those.

Choices:  Vowels Used  A: phonetic B: rhymes C: alphabet D: etymology E: context\nRationales: Vowels used (A): The vowels used refers to the vowels in words.

In \u2018cat\u2019 and \u2018budget\u2019, \u2018t\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 are vowel sounds, respectively. So these words have the same vowel sounds. Hence, they match with (A).\nPhonetic (B): A word may sound phonetically similar to another, but it does not necessarily refer to the literal words themselves. For example, the word \u2018phone\u2019 sounds alike to the word \u2018pony\u2019, but they actually mean different things. Thus, the phonetically similar options are not the same as \u2018vowels used\u2019. Consider the words \u2018ban\u2019 and \u2018tan\u2019. Both words may sound similar to some extent but they are actually different. Hence, they match (E).\nAlphabet (D): The term \u2018alphabet\u2019 indicates a sequence of alphabets.

Since Veronica is brighter than Fred, Fred is brighter than Velma. \n\nVelma can be brighter than Fred since his distance is less than 3x the size of Veronica's. Therefore Freddy's distance is lesser than Veronica's and Freddy.  Let's call Freddy's distance distance f and Veronica's distance v. We can see this by comparing the information given in the statements. We can conclude that v = Velma's distance and f > v.\n\nWe can reason that v will be greater than Velma. Since Velma is greater than f is lesser than v and Velma is 2000 less than 5 times that is v.

They will each require a different amount of money to purchase them while the amount of tickets purchased in this scenario require a different amount of dollars.\n\n### Justification:\nSince Tom only has $1000 to spend on promotion and tickets, he would spend $1000 on promotion and he still have a few dollars to use to buy 500 pounds for flour, so he should buy each flour for $4. That way he will be able to buy all of it for $2000. $2000 will take the flour to 200 pounds which still leaves him to buy 300 pounds and since 500 pounds cost $10, he would need to purchase another 200 pounds leaving him with 488 pounds. Now since he has only 488 pounds and he doesn't want to go short, he would use the remaining $248 he has to buy the 18 pounds left. Since the flour costs $50 a bag and he would use it to make 333 dough balls, he would need about 10 bags of flour as each bag of flour could be used to make at least 100 dough balls. And since it costs $50 he would need $500. Since he uses half of what he needs, he would still need 250 dough balls and if we just look at the rest of the problem, it states that he needs 500 to sell out, then so does he.

In this case, she played 50 rounds.\n\n### Input A: In the 1994 movie Speed was filmed in which city?\n\n### Dem A: If you are a regular reader of the magazine, can you tell me the correct word for \"a group of things\"?\n\n### Dem B: The question asks about history.

{"text": "20 minutes\n\nInput: This is a math question that is asking us how much energy a car uses while going at a speed of 15m/s, in mega-Joules (MJ). \nRationales: This is a math problem that uses scientific principles. \n1. First, note that the car goes at speed 15m/sec or 15 meters per second and not miles. This means that each mile covered is equal to 2 * 15m or 30 miles. \n2. Next, note that the gasoline or fuel needs 10MJ to power 1mile while the car moves at 15m/second or 2 miles/minute. Also, note that the car travels for 4942 meters and not 5000m as stated. \n3. This means that 10MJ of fuel is used for every mile, and 4942 * 10 = 49420MJ of fuel, in total, while traveling 15 miles. \n4. Now, the trick is to multiply the last number to get the answer. The Mega-Joules is the multiplication of Mega to Joules (MJ), which means that 4942MJ x 837 = 4,001,222J (Joules) which translates to 4 001 222 energy units as energy has to be in the energy units. \n\nAnswer: 4 00,1222 units of energy, or 4.001222MJ\n\n#### Bonus:\n\nInput: 18-hour flight, 4,081 meters per second and 100,000 34,330 kilograms per meter per sec.

As of 20days ago Johnny had half as much practice. How many days till Johnny\u2019s practice is 3 times as much as it is currently?\n-Step 2: Analyze the answer choices. In order to find the answer, you\u2019ll need to compare Johnny\u2019s number of practice sessions today to the current number of practice sessions yesterday. After 20 days, then Johnny had 3 times more practice than he had currently.\n-Step 3: Determine the correct answer. Johnny has 2 times as much practice today as he did 20 days ago, indicating Johnny had 2 times the daily amount 20 days ago. By extension, Johnny would have 3 times the practice after 40 days more practice.\n-Step 4: Explain your answer. Johnny had a different practice schedule for 20 days. Each day, he has the same amount of practice. In 20days, Johnny had half of that amount of practice.

{"text": "John shoots a total of 23 foul shots and a total of 21 free throws if he plays in 20 out of 20 games on the team's schedule.\n\n### Rationale:We begin by analyzing each part of the statement in order to understand every piece of data completely.\n\n1. The number of free throws John receives while playing in all of the team's games is 70% * 5 free throws per foul * (number of games played).\n2. Therefore, John receives 70% * (number of games).\n3. After considering points 1 and 2, we can conclude the following.\n4. John gets 70% of the free throws he'd receive playing in 20 games over the season.\n5. Now, the number of games played is irrelevant, as this will be equivalent to the number of games played for each player. \n6. Instead of 20, we can say this data is applicable to all 20 games in the season. \n7. Taking this context into consideration, we can rewrite the above statement to be 70% * (* all 20 games)\n8. Therefore, every statement of this question involves calculating 70% of every game.\n9. The first part of the question, which asks us to divide John's 70 free throws by the number of games he plays, can immediately be solved as 70 / number of games.\n10. The second part of the question is similar but with a different context: what number of free throws does he receive per 80% of a game he plays? \n11. Remembering that in the first part the statement was \"for every game\",  we can infer that in the second part of the question the statement read to be \"per 80% of games\".\n12. The equation to solve is 70% of a game divided by 80% of game.\n13. The equation can thus be written as 70% of game / 80% of 80% of *(game) =...\n14. 70% of 8 games / 80% or 8 games = 920% / 8 games.\n15.

Choices: \tA: plastic B: tin C: steel D: cardboard E: glass\nRationales:  1. We first need to determine what kind of material is being described as a 'container to keep small items'.\n2. Plastic comes in many types, so it is an option. Steel, tin, and cardboard aren't typically used to keep small items.\n3. Hence, glass and plastic are the best options. Steel can be classified as plastic too, but this question is only concerned with containers which typically use glass and plastic material.\n4. It becomes clear that cardboard is an exclusion. Similarly, considering option D, since'small items' could be referring to small objects of different types, option D doesn't fit the description.\n5. If a container is used to keep small items, then it cannot be used to keep vegetables, which are larger and not considered'small'.\n6. Therefore, it is clear that the correct answer is B.

Choices: \nA: detachment B: pain C: joy D: hunger E: depression\n\n### Response : Tooth decay/ loss is a condition where a person would feel pain. However, there are times when tooth decay/ loss happens gradually. Hence, a person when missing teeth can actually at times feel joy. This is supported by studies:\n1. It is a fact that people experiencing tooth loss can experience improved mood. https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/14651858.CD012364.pub3\n2.

This is the total count of the number of photos taken. \n\nA possible interpretation might lead to the correct answer: 2880 + (500/2), which is 4400. However, this would not be correct in the given context as this number is the total number of photos taken. It is not the total number of photos on the gallery.\n\nConsidering the correct interpretation, one should add \nthe first day's count of 500 and then a simple formula to add 120 is 121, which is the same as 605. Adding this to the 500 gives us the total of 1150 photos taken when adding this count to the already existing 400 photos, the total becomes 5150, i.e, 2880+2270.

{"text": "Principal should book the hotels that have a total of 20 queen size beds and will have 5 students per room, a total of 10 rooms.\n### Demonstraiton:Rational: 1. The given question states that each hotel has 2 queen size beds and total capacity of 20 queen bed rooms.\n2. Thus, there are a total of 25 rooms since a hotel has 25 queen size beds overall.\n3. One queen bed room has a total capacity of 2 students so we need to consider that one queen bed room will have minimum 2 students and maximum 4 students.\n4. One couch has a total capacity of only 1 student. Thus, while a couch room has a total capacity, 2 students can't be squeezed in a single couch room.\n5.

Hence, that amount of meat equals $550 in all. \n\n4. Finally, he had to pay for the meat, so he gets $550 minus $550 (for the meat), which results in $0.00. \n\n5. So, he bought the meat for $0.00 but since he has to pay for it, he spent a total of $250.00 which equals $240. \n\n### Inputs:\nHow many more than 100 are 7 times fewer than 200?\n\n### Rationales:\nLet x be 7 times fewer.\n\n### Outputs:\nTherefore, x - 100 and x have to remain the same to maintain the ratio.\nTherefore, x = 102\n\nInputs: What does 45 over 2?\n\nOutputs: 22.5\n\n### Ration:\nTherefore, 45/2 = 35/2\nSo, 35 =225", "answer": " 110"}

It includes the sentence \"Fabric is cut to order\" as the main answer, using dashes to indicate continuity. The same formatting should be used for both the input and the demonstration.\n\n` Rationales: Input: The person put on `\n\nThe key here is finding words that help you remember the location of the answer.

The last rationale gives information about \"rewrite\" and \"erase.\" Repeat as necessary.\n\nIn one sentence, the question asks where the fabric is cut.

Also, we will make a guess of him practicing for 2 hours every day.\n\nHence, the daily requirement per year to be an expert: 125 days/8760hours - 120days/8760 hours = 275hours /day for 10 years = 2750 hours = 2\n\nDays Per Week | Years | Hours to be Expert | Hours to be Master\n---|---|---|---\n7| 10 | 5000| 5400\n6| 10 |  700| 800\n5| 10 |   415| 515\n4| 10 |    65| 650\n3| 10 |      5| 2400\n---\n\n### Step2:\nDefine the terms/variables that will help you approach it.\n\nIn this context we see that the amount of time spent on practicing is a function of time.\n\nIn these cases, to find the best solution we need a formula.

Choices:  D: heat wave  C: snow storm E: rainy season B: autumn A: snow\nRationales: We begin with analyzing all the possible choices in terms of the specific task of cleaning an oven using hot water. \n\n### The first season suggested is heatwave. The purpose of performing the task during a heatwave would be to prevent the accumulation of unwanted grease stains. However, the purpose of using hot water does not necessarily require a heatwave. There can be other times of the day when an oven would need to be cleaned. Moreover, the heatwave season is too long for this purpose. In terms of both time requirements and location, a heatwave is out of question. So, heatwave is eliminated. \n\n## Recommended\nIn general, it was a good practice to use deductive reasoning to eliminate options based on the specifics of the question. In the case of this question it was helpful to understand how the heatwave season was relevant to the question at hand. For each subquestion, understand the reasoning in terms of logical elimination. This approach makes it relatively easy to eliminate all the irrelevant options, as well as the ones we deem to be unlikely.\nThe answer is A: autumn. \nWe conclude that the \t\t\t\t\t\tquestion and its answer are consistent with each other. \n\n## How did that question and answer affect your confidence?\nAs I'm taking all online classes, it is essential to work on my confidence.

If the question requires the category of event, then the correct answer is 'hat-A woman'. A hat-A woman hat categorizes wearing a hat for a general event.\n2. The specific hat types that come after (glass hat, jeweled hat, and tam) are to indicate the details of the event, and the type of hat to match them.\n3. The first hat type, 'glass hat' is not matching to any other event specifications. (the glass hat is specifically a crown, so it wouldn't suit any type of event.)\n4. 'jeweled hat' is a type of hat that could be suitable for multiple types of occasions, as shown by the 'Hat-A woman' category.\n5. The last (and only) hat type that matches to the event specifications is 'Tam'.\n   This style of hat could be worn for all types of events.\n\nTam hat is the best choice for an event as it is capable of covering both formal and casual events. Given the statement, the best answer is Tam.", "answer": " 21600"}

So, 12000 vibrations. Multiply and divide, 9600x2=19200 and that's 2x the massager at the lowest setting, so, that is 1800. Therefore, he experiences 1800 vibrations in 5 minutes.\n\n### Input/Response\nInput: At the lowest setting, the massager vibrates at 5000 beats per hour.  At the highest vibration setting, its vibration rate is 112 Hz.  How many beats does the massager vibrate in 5 minutes?\n\nResponse: To find the answer, you need to use the formula B = 1000/f where:\n1. f = massager vibration rate\n2. B = massager vibrations (how many beats is the massager vibrating in 5 minutes)\nThen, you can use the formula to find: 1000xf =B 1000=BxF. You can then use the reciprocal formula B = 1/0 and B = 5 minutes and so you have an answer of 8 beats in 5 minutes. \n\n### Inputs:\nInput: It takes around 7 years to make a 90-mile-long railroad.

{"text": "72\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo solve this question it's important to understand that the words 'head' and 'leg' in this context are being used to refer to individual animals, rather than the actual parts of their bodies.\nIt's also important to note that each animal in the flock is either a head or a leg, so the number of heads plus the number of legs must be equal to the total number of emus in the flock (60).\nThe first step is to find the total number of animals, which can be determined by adding the two numbers in the given equation; 60/2 = 30, so there are a total of 30 animals in the flock.\nThen, we can use the given information to determine the number of heads in the flock; it's clear from the question that there must be an equal number of heads and legs in the flock. From this, we can deduct that there must be 15 heads in the flock. \nWe can also determine that there must be 20 legs in the flock if there are 15 heads.\nFinally, we can use these two pieces of information to determine the total number of emu animals in the flock; 30 + 15 + 20 = 65, which means that there are 65 emu animals in the Farmer Brown's flock.\nSince there are 72 animals (65 emus + 7 penguins), it is therefore possible for a farmer to raise a total of 72 in his flock.\n\n### Input1:What is the meaning of the saying \u201cThrough the looking glass\u201d\n\n### Response1: Look to the future\n\n### Rationales: \n### A quick online dictionary search suggests that this phrase is most often used as a reference to the fantasy novel through the looking-glass, and that it can also be used as a colloquialism for the expression \"through a looking-glass\", referring to the glass mirror in the famous children's story \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\", which is a sequel to Through the Looking-glass.

{"text": "I found the information provided in this problem to be extremely helpful in determining the correct answer.\n\n### Rationales:\nWhen a bicycle's price is increased by 15%, the new price is $328. To find the selling price of a bike sold last year whose original price was $220, all we need to do is find its original selling price and multiply it by 115%. That is, (15% + 100%) of last year's selling price, multiplied by 100 to be more precise. The original selling price, $220, is 90% of $250. Multiplying $250 by 100% is $250. And, as 15% + 85%, is 0.15 + 0.85, we get the selling price of $328.\n\nAnswer: The selling price of a $220.00 bicycle last year was $328.00.\n\n### Input : A person buys a toy from a store, is it possible they pay with a dollar?\n\n### Rationale:\nIf you can't answer the problem from scratch, try using the following method which uses the following steps:\n\n1. Break the problem into smaller steps and make sure to keep the question in mind. 2. Look for patterns or hidden details by analyzing the question in detail. \n3. Identify and remove any obvious wrong answers.\n\nHere, the problem can be simplified as shown below:\n\nIs it possible to pay for a $1.00 toy with a dollar? Here, the word 'possible' has been highlighted as it is a clue that may shed some light about the right answer.\n\nThe answer may lie in if it is possible to pay one dollar to buy a toy if it costs one dollar. The answer will be yes if we think of $1.00 or one dollar. Considering that our only available choice is a $1.0 bill, it is unlikely that this person paid with a dollar bill to buy a $1.0 toy. Hence, we can rule out this option.\n\nThe answer can be a 'no', as this person may", "answer": " 253"}

{"text": "The river is 5 feet deep by mid-May, it becomes 10 feet deep by mid-June, and becomes 3 times deeper by mid-July, so it must be 30 feet deep.\n\n### Input\nInput: If the current is three feet deep and the water is flowing at a rate of two feet per hour, how deep will the water be in seven hours?\n\n### Answer\nThe current is three feet deep, it has flowed one foot (since the question says the water was one foot deep when the flow started) and is now two feet deep. So it has flowed two feet (since it is now one foot deep more) in one hour (which is 60 minutes), or one foot in 60 minutes (which is 1/60 feet/minute, or 1/3600 feet per hour). After another seven hours, this foot per hour will have flowed another 4200/3600 = 1.1701 feet \u2248 1.2 feet. Thus, the water will be three feet deep, in one day.\n\nThe current is three-feet deep, so the depth is increasing by +2 feet, which is being added at +2 feet per hour; so every hour the current is +2 feet deeper, i.e. at +2 feet + (2 feet * hour#1) = +4 feet. Then since water depth of river is increasing at +4 feet per hour, in one day water is (4 feet * 24 hours) = 96 ft.\n\n\n### Inputs: In 2006, the height of the Empire State Building was 1250 feet, the width was 100 feet, the length was 1400 feet, and the population of New York City was 8000000.\n\nNow, the same building is taller and wider, its length has remained the same, and the population of downtown Manhattan\nhas risen to 200000 people.

The age in 7 years should be the age in which 7 years from the time she planted her tree, then she can expect her tree to bear fruits.\n\n### The problem with your response is that it only takes into consideration the age of Lydia at present (9), ignoring the age of planting the tree (4). The question is regarding the age of Lydias when she gets to eat her first apple from the tree.\n\n### Correction: Lydia planted her tree when she was 5 years old and is now (9) 9 years old. If we assume the average lifespan of an apple tree is 7 years, then she is 11 or 12 years old when the apple tree will bear fruits. Then she's 11 or 8 years old when she gets to eat the apples for the first time.\n\n### Another way to solve the problem: From the facts: it takes 7 years for apple tree to bare fruit\n\nNow, this can be translated to\nx = number of years from now that the apple tree can produce its own fruit.\n\nSo if x = 7 then, how many years from now can an apple tree produce fruits?\n\nI.e: 9 + x = 7\n\nOr, 2 * x = 9\n\nOr, x = number of years from 9\n\nSo, if 9 is the present age (x= 9 - 7), then x = 2.\n\n1.

Choices: 4: Banana Republic 5: Apple 6: Nike 6: Zara 7: Levi\u2019s 8: Gap 8: Calvin Klein\nRationales: You need to examine the question. The question reads:\n\"This is an ad for ________ clothing company?\"\nIf you know the name of the company, the question itself is actually hinting that the ad is definitely for that company.\nIn addition, there are a lot of hints in the ad. Remember that the ad is also telling you a lot about the company itself.\n\nStep 1. The ad starts with the statement, \"If you need style inspiration, you're in the right spot\". The word'style' hints at the clothing company, but also at the clothing, that's why the ad states \"in the right spot\".\n\nStep 2. Next, we can see that the ad is asking us to \"think different, feel the difference, be the difference\" \"Think different\" could mean think in a different way than how the competition is thinking. This is a technique that is found on most Apple advertisements. That is why we can use it to eliminate one of the choices.\n\nStep 5. \"Difference makers\" could be a phrase that describes the company's ideology, but could also describe a person that wears their clothes.\nStep 6.

Here's an interesting clue: The ad states we'll learn about these difference makers - who are they?\nWe read \"who\" and see that these are also makers, but probably of something else, rather than of clothes themselves.\nStep 8.

{"text": "Michael has 150 matchsticks in total.\nDemonstration:\n\nInput: Michael has a lot of match sticks at home and he now uses 1/3 of the sticks that he initially had. He then uses all of these matchsticks to craft 30 houses. If each house uses 10 sticks, then with 1/3 of matchsticks already used, how many matchstick does Michael has left? To answer the question, we just have to follow the same logic that the matchsticks that remain were originally 2/3rd of the total. So, if x is the total number of original matches, x/3 are already used, and x/3 were used to craft the houses. Now, remaining sticks are x/3 less than the total number of sticks so we can say x/3 + x/3, and the answer turns out to be x/3+x/3+x/13=1+x. So, the total number of matchsticks is 1+x, where x is the total number remaining after two-thirds are used already. So, 1+x=2x-1. We can then multiply both sides of the equation by the original number of sticks, 30, and we get the total number of original matchsticks is 30x.

The store is closing because the customers don't buy any items C. The store is closing due to the owner's absence D. The store is closing to the owner's death E. The store is closing for business reasons \nRationales: Focusing on each possibility:\n\n- The store is closing because it has too many customers: The statement suggests some kind of overcrowding that is stopping the store from running. This might indicate that the store is experiencing an excessive number of customers. This would make choice A - there are too many customers. The correct choice.\n\n- The store closes because the customers don' t buy anything: This doesn't really connect as the reason for closing the store. What stops the owner from buying is only related to the type of product he can afford and the store's own economic status. But, the closure decision is about the customers and no mention of products is heard from the statement. \n\n- The store close is because the owner is absent: The owner's absence makes sense but it is also a cause rather than a reason. The owner can be absent only when the store is closed and since option C talks about the store closing, the idea of the owner being absent doesn't make much sense. \n\n-The store closes because the owner has died: Option E talks about why the owner is dead.

{"text": "Jessica has 165 dollars more than Rodney.\n\n### Rationale:1. The question is comparing who has money between different people.\n2. The sentence, \"Ian has half as much money\" means that Ian has 20 less money than whoever is next to him in the line. Ian has 30 less money than who is next to him, since Ian has 10 (half a ten) less money than the person next to him. \n3. Since the amount of money that Jessica has is 100 more than the amount of money Ian has, then Ian has less than 100 dollars. Therefore, Jessica has 160 more money than Ian, which means she has more than 35 more money than Rodney because he only has 35 more money. \n4.

The bottom half has 12 brics of snow added per row while the top half has 8. This gives a grand total of 18, because if we do it with a calculator, 2x12 + 8x8 = 18 for 10 rows. \n\nAs for Step 4, I made the simplifying calculation as 2x12 = 24, added the 8 to make my end number equal 32, and then multiplied 32 by 10 to make my grand total equal 320. I did this because to me it was easier to do two multiplications (24x2 and 8x10) than three adding actions (2x10 + 2x8 + 8x8). In the end, my plan to use these simplifications helped me to arrive at my total of 320.\n\nSteps 5 is where I checked my work by dividing 320 by 2 and multiplying that answer by 2 to make it equal 22.

{"text": "4 ants\n\n### Rationale:\nTo solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of ants found by the four children. We can simplify the problem by taking the total number of annie as the sum of the numbers of ants found by each child.\n\nThe ants found by Abe = 4\n\nWe know that Beth sees 50 ants more than Abe. Therefore, the number '50' can be interpreted as '50 more' ants.\n\nThe annie found by Beth = '50 more' than '4' = 94 ants. \n\nSimilarly, the number 'double' found by Cecilia can also be interpreted as '2 more'. Hence, the number '2 more' can be converted into '50' or '50 more'.\n\nThe ants '2 more' than Abe = 2 more ants = '2 more' = 50 more ants = 70 ants.\n\nTherefore, the total ants found by each of the children would be:\n\nAbe - 4\n\nBeth - 94\nCecilia - 70\nDuke - 94\n\nThe total number of ants would be 94+70=164 ants. Since we cannot assume these four children each found only one ant, the answer to our question would be 4 instead of 164.\n\nThus, 4 ants would be the correct answer. \n\n### Input; Which letter is the beginning of a word?\n\n### Rationales:\nHere, the letters 'k' and 'l' are at the beginning of 'knife' and 'large', respectively, and 'i' is in the middle in both words.

How numerous building blocks can suitable into the box?\nRationale: 1. The inquiry asks what number of building obstructs can be fitted into a box, which is 9 x 7 x 6 Inches.\n2. To resolve the question, we need to know what measurement the block has and how the block fits into the box.\n3. The first measurement of the box is 8 inches, 12 inches, and 10 inches. This represents that the box is 36 inches on all three sides.\n4. The second estimate of the block is 3 x 2 x 5 inches. This equates to a block measurement of 15 inches 3= inches on two sides and 20 inches in length on the third side.\n5. To determine how many structure blocks can fit into a box, we need to compute the space that can accommodate the block in the box.\n6. To begin with, let's check the area of the block that can fit in the box. This is done by multiplying the height and area of the box. For this, we can use the following formula: Area = length * width\n7. Therefore, Area of Box = 6 x 7 x 8 = 288 inches2\n8. Area of Block = 15 x 20 x 5 = 300 inches2\n9.

{"text": "S-S-S-S-SS-S-S\n\n### Justification: We can see that the question gives us the information required to solve this problem. Additionally, this approach is helpful in determining relationships between values. Using the letters S and SS we can observe that the quantity increases by two each time we write the letter; as such, we can apply linear thinking to determine the sum of all the numbers to solve the problem. The first letter, S denotes the number of cookies Sabrina had to begin with. The second letter, SS, denotes the number of cookies her mom gave her after her brother received 10 cookies. The letter S after the second SS represents the number of cookies Sabra left herself after sharing them with her sister. Finally, the fourth S, SS, shows the cookies Sabrina has left herself after sharing them.\n\nBy applying the same logic to this process, we can reason that the sum of letters S, S, S, and S, is the final number of cookies.

{"text": "**Rational explanation**\n1. First, we need to know the base values for the quantity 10 and 8:\n\n```\n{\n 10 x 40 = 400\n 8 x 20 = 160\n}\n```\n\n2. Mr. Callen bought 8 wooden toys from the crafts store at $20 each so his base value is $20 and the total value spent on buying was $160.\n3. Let's assume that Mr. Callen sells 6 paintings at the 10% loss and sells 4 paintings at the 20% loss. For the paintings, our base value is $40 and the loss value is 40(10%) - 40 = 0.4 or 40%:\n\n```\n 6 painted pieces(10% loss) = 3.2\n  4 painted pieces(20% loss) =  1.0\n```\n\n4. We are left with six pieces of paintings with 40% loss and four pieces of paintings with a 20% loss that Mr. Callen didn't sell and they are valued at $40 and $20:\n\n```\n6*0.4=4\n6 painted pieces(1% loss) = 4.0\n\n4 painted pieces(25% loss) = 1\n4 painted pieces(30% loss) =.6\n```\n\n5.

{"text": "To do this problem, we need to first identify the variable as $24. Next, we can use order to put our equation in a suitable format. \n\n### Reason and Solution:\nSo far, we have obtained Jenny's original value as $24 and Jenny's remaining amount after spending a part of it. We can conclude that the amount she has saved is the amount that she spent. Using this information, we can write an equation to determine the saved value. Here, let x = amount she has saved, and y = amount she spent. \n\nHence, we can write the equation as $24 - y = x. \n\nNote that Jenny started with $24, then gave away $3/7 of it. She must have saved the rest of it.\nTherefore, we know $24 - y > 1/7. Let's plug this value, $(24 - y), into our equation and form the inequality. \n\n$24 - y >1/7$\n\n$24 > 7(24 - y)$\n\n$ 17 > 156 - y$\n\n$17 - 156 > y.$\n\nSo, the saved amount is about $156 - y.\n\nWe already know that $y > 3/7$. So, our saved value can only be as great as or greater than $156 - 3/7.$\n\nWe can conclude that $156 - (3/7)$ is not possible because it results to a value less than $156$. Therefore, we need to add 7 to it and get $156 -4/7$. This is the closest value to the saved amount and hence, the correct answer.\n\nAnswer: $156 - \\frac4{7} = 148$\n\n### Note: We could also have found the correct answer using cross-multiplication as follows.\n\nTo solve this problem using cross-multiplication, we can write the cross-multiplication rule equation as follows.\n\n$$\\frac{x}{y} = \\frac{156}{148}$$\n\nWe have found that the quotient value of $156$ is $148$.", "answer": " 21"}

We can't assume that the statement is necessarily correct because it's a choice given in some questions. \n- In addition, the statement is incorrect not only because Tim doesn't sleep 73 hours. It's also incorrect because this is not the answer that Tim would be able to figure out based on the information available in the question. \n- The question does not provide sufficient data for Tim to know how much sleep he has had. All that the question indicates is that he may have slept more than usual. As far as Tim is concerned, there is no way for him to be certain about how many hours he has slept.

The ants will be gone.\n\nRationales:\n\n\n### Input 20 ants in a jar. In 24 hours, there are 8 ants; after 48 hours, there are 0 ants.\n\n### Response The numbers are growing exponentially, doubling after each hour. The first day, only 19 ants were in the jar. So, 20 is actually not a valid answer, as that would require an infinite number of ants in a jar with finite room. The ants would keep doubling forever, but they'll get crushed or die of exhaustion before they even get close to the point where they can crush their footprints.\n\nRational: When we look at the problem as an individual we start to make a mistake.\n\n### Rational: Look at the 5 hours as 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Each hour is divided into groups of two and three hours.\n\n### Each group adds 2, 4, 6, 8, and then continues to add. That's what we need to do in our final answer.\n\n### First, we know there are 20 ants then after 2 hours there are 40 ants. Then, after the next 2 hours there will be 80 ants and then after the next 2 (11) hours there will be 160 ants. That's 16 plus 8 equals 24. So, we started at the halfway point at 2 hours and now we have completed the whole cycle.\n\n### Our final answer is 24 hours.\n\n## Instructions for Task 2:  The following exercise presents a short composition expressing an emotion or emotionless state (\u201cstate of mind\u201d), followed by a task that asks the reader to provide a response.

{"text": "If the coffee shop is open for a total of 25 hours in a week, then it's possible it brews 10 cups at a time, hence brewing a total of 260 cups or 20 cups a day. This amount of cups could also fit within the constraints of the statement of 10 cups per hour and the total over the weekend of 120.\n### Answer Choices:\nAnswer: This question is not asking for the answer to the given equation, but for the way in which it produces the answer. \n### Demonstraition:\nThe question provides a description and a math equation, the first is not necessarily the same as the second. The equation 260 cu(pi) - 100 h(i) = 120 is a simple calculation that will produce the correct answer, however it does not describe when it produces that result. The question wants to know when 260 is the result of this equation. The result for 100h is the first result of 260, which would mean the coffee shop brews 20 cup per day over the weekend. This fits perfectly with the information given in that the same amount of coffee is made on the weekend as the weekday (10). If the coffee shop is brewing 10 cups an hour then the result of 262 (10cu + 260) would be within the constraints too. \n\n### Explanation:\nI assumed that the answer choices that are relevant to the question were C, E, K and O. I believe the easiest option with the most evidence to lean towards is option O which is \"The coffee shop brews 30 cups.\" This answer is supported by the fact that with 10h an hour and a result of 261 or 30 cups, we can see that we don't really have to factor in how often the coffee shop is open a day during the weekend to reach the answer. If we wanted to, we could factor that in, however, we know it will likely be less than 10h a day. We also know that the total could fit within the equation of 120/120, which is a weekend of 10h a cup. If we go to the", "answer": " 370"}

{"text": "2.5 hours\n\n### Explanation:\nThis question was very straightforward as you just needed to use multiplication. You can start with the number of hours of the question which would be 120 by dividing 130 by 1.

You get:\n\n18 > 36\n\nWhich means that there are more females than males so, the answer has to be a number with more females than males. \n\nTherefore, we know that the answer has to be divisible by 2, and the only 2 options that are divisible by 2 and smaller than 18 are 6 and 9.\n\nWe then subtract 9 from our original answer, 18, because if anything other than that gets left behind, than that would mean more males than female, thus that would mean our answer had to have been a female that's divisible by 2(6)\n\nWhen you subtract 9 from 18, the remaining answer has to be another number divisible by 2 (6), and that is 6 < 18 < 9 \n\nWe already have our answer and there is only 1 answer, so it has to be 6.\n\nThere are 6 female members in the glee club.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "To ensure that Lloyd, Mark, and Michael all have a total of 900 cards, Mark first needs to have 20 more cards than Lloyd, and Michael needs to have an additional 705 cards. \n\n\n### Rationales:\nThe answer to this question depends on knowing how many cards each person initially has. It isn't until all three people have the same number of cards that Lloyd, Mark, or Michael have a total of 1000 cards. The only information we're given is that Lloyd has \"thrice as many cards as Mark\". Using the PEMDAS method, the equation becomes: \n\n```\nLloyd has 3 times as many cards as Mark\n$$\n3\\text{ times as many cards}\\left ( \\text{\\text{} x 2 + 10 } \\right ) = ( x -21 ),\n\\] \nand x is Mark's number of cards\n```\n\nWe are not given the number of cards Mark has, so his number of cards is x. Solving for a value of x on its own, we get: \n\n$$\nx = ( 3x - 7 ) - 21\n\\]\n\nor:\n\n```\n\n$$\nx\\left ( 3x -7 \\right ) \\ - 21 - 7 = -21\n\\]\n```\n\nThis means that when Lloyd has 3 times as much cards as Mark, Mark doesn't have enough cards to equate to 1000 total cards, but he needs at least another 705.\n\nThe question next asks Lloyd and Michael to collect cards so that all three will eventually have a total of 2000 cards. So, Lloyd needs to collect another 21 cards in order to match Mark's cards, and Michael needs to collect 1509 cards, which is how many we started with. Therefore, Lloyd needs 21 cards and Michael needs 1509 to match Mark's 300 cards and to have a total of 600 cards, which is the final goal.\n\n### Input and Rationales:\nIn a class of 55 students, 15 of them have an odd-numbered examination schedule.

Choices: A: water B: spaghetti C: lemon D: noodles E: sauce\nRationales:We begin by analyzing the question. The choices presented to us aren't just random options with little relation to the logic of the statement. \n\nStep 1. The logical step to take is to identify what the statement is actually describing: a 'girl' who is 'putting''something' into a 'pot'.\n\nFrom here, we are left with four possible combinations: \"water > girl > put > pot\" (A), \"spaghetti > girl > put >pot\" (B), \"lemon > girl > put >  pot\" (C), and \"noodles >  girl > put >pot \" (E).\n\nStep 2. Since the only relevant item mentioned in the statement is'soup', we rule out the option that uses a spaghetti-in-a-pot example.\n\nStep 1 + step 2. This leaves us with A: water (girl puts water inside the pot) and C: lemon (girl puts lemon into pot).\n\nStep 3. If the pot is for soup, then lemon is inappropriate, because lemon isn't a soup ingredient.\n\nStep 5. Therefore, only \"water\" can be a suitable answer for this question.\n\nFinal Verdict: The correct answer is \"water\".\n\n### InputWhat were two things one person needs to play baseball?

{"text": "```\nThe total number of rows of corn cobs the farm has grown is 29.\n```\n\n### Reasoning:\n1. First, we calculate the total number of rows of the farm. There are two fields that contain a total number of 35 rows of corn cobs (13 + 22 row = 35).\n2. We need to understand the number of corn cobs that are in each row of corn cobs. The farm has a total of 8 corn cobs between two fields. This tells us that each corn cob in a row has four other corn cobs.\n3. After the calculation from the two previous steps.\n4. We can conclude that the farm has grown {35/4} corn cobs which can be divided by each corn cob is growing on a row. The farm has 8 corn cobs on 29 rows of corn, thus 35 divided by 8 equals the total of corn cobs grown by the farm.\nThis means 4. Thus, 29 is how many corn cobs farmer has grown.\n5.

{"text": "28\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question states a monster has feasted on 847 people over three hundred years. The monster arose once every hundred years, therefore it had four hundred and forty seven years to consume 847 people, meaning the first ship to be feasted on was 700 years old. Since the monster had fed on 821 people prior to the new ship, that means the new ship had an additional 111 people to catch up to the required 847.\n\nBy the time the new ship came on to the scene, the required number of people, 847, had already been accounted for, leaving exactly one hundred less than that for the new ship. To calculate the number of people on the new ship one must subtract 100 from the total number of people required for the 847 and then divide by two.

All other choices must be greater than zero.\nNext we count the number of choices that are closer than 88,which has already been eliminated in the first step.\nThere are two choices that are within 88, which would have to be k and P since C,M,Q, and E are negative numbers.\n\nThere is no choice that is exactly 88 away from home except for k,which is too far away from home.\nFrom left to right there is one choice that is closer to home that can be eliminated, k,so the answer would be P.\nAnswer: P\n\nInput: What kind of meat is used to make hot dogs?

{"text": "Harry has 24 apples.\n\n### Rationale:Firstly, from the provided information about Tim, we know that he has less apples than Marth.

Substituting Tim's value, we get\n```\nTim= 38-15=23\n```\nThe difference between Martha and Harry would have been exactly 23 if Tim had 23 apples.

This means that the laser printer is twice as fast as the dot matrix printer.\n\nNow, since it takes three hours to complete fifteen tasks, (assuming that each task is equal to printing one page), we can write the equation as\n\n\n$3* \\frac{15}{10^{22}}*10^9=17 \\log_{10^{22}}$\n\n\nAfter applying standard logarithm rules, we get\n\n\n$10^{59}=17$\n\n\nHence the time would be 59 hours, which is one day.\n\n### Acknowledgment", "answer": " 19"}

Considering the question, we need to deduce the answer by matching the question and its corresponding answer. \n### 2. There are multiple choice options (A-E). It's very unlikely for an individual to become famous for a certain art if they have almost zero experience. It could imply that the corresponding choice would ideally be a choice which has a strong probability of success i.e. highly popular and easily accessible.\n### 3. Let's find out the choices which are most popular/easily available. A person could become famous for music, film, or graphic design. But the choices are too broad to be selected as the correct answer.\n### 4. Then, we need to identify the art which is least used or would be relatively harder to get into i.e. least popular. We could eliminate the easier choices based on popularity.\n### 5. Finally, we can identify the most suitable answer that would be least popular and would not need a lot of time and investment.

{"text": "Jeanette can juggle 7 objects after five weeks. Her starting number of objects at the beginning of practice was 4. Then, after one week of practice, the starting number increased to 5. So, 5 + 1 = 6. After two weeks of practice, her starting number increased by 2, to 6 + 2 = 8. After three weeks of practice, her new starting number was 8 + 3 = 11. After four weeks of practice, her number increased to 11 + 4 = 15. After five weeks of practice, her final starting number was 15 + 5 = 20. Therefore, Jeanette can juggle 20 objects after five weeks of practice.\n\n### Analysis:This response appropriately completes the task. The response is complete, concise and coherent. The answer is clearly given at the end of the response. The answer is a well-reasoned number of objects Jeanette can juggle based on the details given in the prompt.

Ending number of years \\text{E} = 5, which indicates that the increments between starting number \\textbf{s} and ending number \\textbf{e} are equal to the increment.\n\nSince the increment \\textbf{I = 1}, our equation would look like this: \\textbf{S + 4} = \\textbf{E} or \\textbf{S = 3 + 4}", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": "5/2  + 2/20 = 5\n\n### Rationales:\n1.\nThe correctness of the answer relies on the validity of the assumption that the capacity of the chairs is 2 persons. This is indeed the case if the chairs are 2-person desks (i.e., no table-only).\n\n2. First, we notice that the board members cannot occupy more than 2 chairs per row. If we apply this rule to each row (r), it means that the sum of the board members in each row must be equal to 2 times the number of rows (n).\n\n3. In light of this and the rule that the number of chairs is 2/5 of total chairs, we observe that we must subtract 1/5 from the number of board members to acquire an answer (the number of chairs is the remainder).\n\n4. Now, we see that the number of board members that attend the meeting is equal to n times 2 minus (n-1)/5, which is equal to 5.\nAnswer: 5\n\n## What is this practice?\nThe process of going through several similar tests, recording your time and score, and comparing them over time is called meta-reasoning. \nMeta-reasoning is all about making better choices when given a situation and choosing the best answer. Meta-reasoning teaches you how to apply the same logic and reasoning when given a test to identify the best option.

You are not alone. In fact, most people feel daunted by the very idea of meta-reasoning and many of them don't even attempt to use meta-reasoning for their daily learning.

Ariella's saving accounts earns her simple interest rate of 10 percent per annum. How much money will Ariella have in her son's accounts after a period of two years?\n\n#### Rationales:\nTo figure out the question, we start by understanding the instructions. From the statement, we can determine the following:\n\n\u2022 Ariella has $20 more than Daniella\n\u2022 Ariella saves 10% on her savings\n\u2022 After two years, she will have 40 more than what Daniella has saved.\n\nTo use this information in relation to the answer, we first eliminate the choice that are irrelevant. We know that one of the choices will involve the amount that Daniella saves. Although, we can't use it, we still need to identify the amount that Daniella saved. So, we eliminate choices C, E, H and I.\n\nNext, we have to think of how the amount of money saved is used, meaning how is the balance in the account created? The answer is through the accrual of interest, so we eliminate option J. The remaining options are B, D, F, G, and J.\nThe options that are left should be eliminated by considering the rate of interest as follows:\n\nFrom the data we have, the rate of interest is 10% per year, or 0.1 per year. We know that a portion of the saved money is saved, as Ariella's savings account earns 10% each year. So, we can think of the value that is added to the account each year.\n\nFor each given year, the account balance is increased by the total of 10% and the value that was in the account for the previous year. So, if the value in the account at the start of the year is $1, the value then after 1 year = $1*(1+0.1).\n\nContinuing, we can use this formula\n\n\\$\\begin{align*}1^1 & = 1.1 \\\\ 2^", "answer": " 720"}

For instance, there's no way they bought [52%20of%5BCaffeine-Free...%5D](52%2520of%255BCafficine-Free...%255D), that would mean there was only one container or option out of five, that just doesn't seem to be correct.

The garden center was discounting purchases by 10 %. He bought 5 pots from pansy for$4.99 a piece and 1 hydrangea for $14.99. If he buys four more pansies for$1.99 and pays with a $51.00 bil, how much will he be paid back?\n\nRationales: To answer this question, we first need to understand that each pansy is $4.99, meaning that 5 pansies cost $24.95.  Next, we determine whether $24.99 is the same in cents as $25.00, which would give us 5 pansies plus 4 other pansies for $25.04.  If it were true, he would end up with $25.05 in change.  This can be done by looking at cents and figuring out which is greater, $119.88 (126 pansies) or $92.50 (94 petunias).  This gives us a value of $4.99 for a pansy and 94 petunias are $4.94 per flower, meaning they are more valuable than a pansy.

{"text": "We could solve this mathematical problem by creating a table, where the lion population would depend on the month. We would not need to input specific values for how many lions were in Londolozi in particular, but use the information to find the answer for how many lions are there in total on a particular month after year has passed by multiplying the value of each lion by the age. For the months where there weren't any lions, the number wouldn't be any greater than 0. After solving, we get that the population was 114. Since the month 4, the population was less than before, so we could assume that some deaths happened in the month 3 or 2. Answer: 114\n\n### Instructions:What action is needed to solve this equation?\n\n### Rationales:\nIn order to solve an equation we need to find what value would x be in order to make the equation true. For example:\n```\n2x + 5 = 10\n```\nIf the value of x is 1, it will be a true equation.\n```\n2(1) + 5 = 2 + 5 = 7 \n```\nIf the number is -2 for example, the equation will be: \n```\n2(-2) + 5 = -4\n```\nThe following is a list of example of equation:\n```\n(8 + 2) + (-3) + 5\n2x - 7 3x + 5\n8a - 3a  a^{1} + a^{2}\n```\n\n### Instructor:The table tells the number of people eating at the restaurant in a specific time.

These figures equate to 18 mm of rain, which means that he experienced approximately 95% of the total rain at home for 3 days.\n\nThis means that Greg experienced approximately 95/100 * 6 = 5.25 mm of rain for the 3 days he was camping. In the given scenario, Greg experienced 26 - 5.25 = 20.75 mm of rain during the week, which equates to less than 1 mm per day. Therefore, the amount of rain experienced at his home was three times more than the amount experienced at his camping site.\n\nAnswer: 95/3 = 0.35 or 0,350 so 0,35 - 0,333 = 0,017\n\n### Input \n\n### Solution\n\nInput: Greg's daily income was 100x-y for the first week with daily expenses of 50z+2z^2 for that first, and 2z+2z^3 for the rest of the weeks where x,y,z, the first week was 128.

{"text": "44 minutes of advertisements.\n\n### Inputs and analysis:\n\nIf we look carefully at the given data and information, it may be observed that 8% of the 30-minute newscast is for advertisements. If the weather forecast is 2 minutes long, then 72 minutes are available for other purposes (weather forecast accounts for 8%). However, since 72 minutes are not 8% of 30 minutes, we know that the newscast includes 3 times as much advertising as national/international/sports news/weather forecast. \n\nWe also know that 12/60 = 0.2 (i.e, 20% of the 3 x 60 minutes newscast is devoted to national news).\nSo, 20% - 8% = 12%, which means 12 minutes out of the 120 minutes (100/60) = 20 minutes is devoted to national news\nSo, 2 + 5 + 20 = 27 minutes are national, international, sports, and weather forecasts.

{"text": "2 inches + ((Wednesday's total - Tuesday's total) + Tuesday's Inches) + (Monday's total - Monday's inches) = 11 inches.\n\n### Rationale:Let M be the amount of total rain and let N be the rain after M is removed. According to the logic, since the biggest storm was during Friday, we need to account for that. So, M + N = 11.\n\nNow let us remove 1 inch from M and N, which is 11 total. Then let C be the amount of total not removed. Therefore, C is 11. However, the amount of rain still must remain the same as for 11. But this does not make sense as there is now only 1 inch of rain. So, the only solution for this is that 1 inch is absorbed. This leaves 10 inches.\n\nFor 10 inches, we need to subtract 1, which gives us 9. This gives further values of 8, 7, and 6. But 7 inches cannot occur because we know for sure that Friday was the biggest storm, so 8 is the right answer.\n\n### Output:8\n\n### Rationales: 1: The given problem requires you to find the average daily temperature.\n\nTo do this you begin with the information that the highest temperature that day was 146 and, therefore, the lowest was -25.

A dried-rot is an organic material that starts in the timber that leads to rotting. It is, in other words, not a termite. So, A is eliminated.\n\nStep 02: We rule out B. Timber is a common term for a type of wood. Therefore timber is not a termite but also not an option.\n\nStep 8: We rule out E. Insects or pests that only live on wood, do not consume it directly or indirectly, and never burrow into wood are not termites. So, E is eliminated.\n \nStep 5: We rule out F.

We first have to breakdown and analyze the question statement\n\n2. From the statement, it states that a \"group of ghosts\" is needed for the next step.\n\n3. So far, it is unknown, so, as we tackle the \"group of ghosts\", we must analyze the choices given.\n\n4. When analyzing the choices given, we can say that ghosts can refer to either 1) spirits of deceased 2) undead creatures that haunt humans. and \n\n5. In this context, we know that the word \"ghosts\" refers to the first category, spirits of deceased.\n\n6. According to the options B, D, E, if we are to place the word \"ghosts \" in the context of these options, it wouldn't make any sense.\n\n7. Thus, considering options B and D are not possible.\n\n8. Now, we have the answer options - C and B.\n\n9. We can see that option C is \"ghastly things\". Although the word \"ghastly\" can refer to something ghostly or scary, the actual phrase \"ghastly things\" has a different meaning. \n\n10. Thus, we can say that ghastly things is not actually a phrase for what the question is asking.\n\n11. So, we have option B as the only answer left.\n\n12. And the correct answer is B : unfriendly spirits\n\n### Input :What do you mean if you say, \u201cthat is so on the nose\u201d?\n\n###Response: The meaning of \"on the nose\" is something that is \"to the point\" or has little embellishment.

Choices: \nA: invest B C: save D: donate E: spend\nRationales:\n\n1. The question is stating that there are four possible ways to make your money grow. Invest, save, donate, and spend.\n2. Invest is a way to make your money accumulate gains via the stock market or other methods. \n3. Save means to keep the interest accrued on the saved amount and then use that amount later at an interest rate which is a fixed percentage. \n4. Donate means to use an accumulating amount to donate to charity. \n5. Spend is to consume the entire amount at face value. It won't give you any interest or gain by saving, investing, or donating your wealth. \n6. Now, let's see whether an accumulating amount or money is a better option. Consider if the accumulating is being kept for a long time. The longer the time period, the more interest would be acquired. The initial accumulated amount will not be spent by you and will grow, and that growth would give an accumulated amount to your heir of the sum that was saved, plus the interest. \n7. Therefore, of all the options, investing is the best option. It would multiply your money and get your heirs wealthy. Other options lead to dissatisfaction, as the growth rate won't be better than saving or spending for any extended period. So, the most appropriate result is A: invest.\nAnswer: A \t: invest\n\nOutput: How many letters are on average per package?

This gives us 10 as the probability.\n- If black does not appear in the 1st place, it will appear in the 5th. By considering 6 different cases, the probability will be one out of six, so the probability will be one-sixth, which is five-sixths.\n- If brown does not appear in the third place, it will appear as the first. So by considering 6 cases possible, the probability will be six-elevenths, which is five elevenths.\n- If green does not appear in the second place, it will appear at both the third and fourth place (1/6 + 1/7).

A: \u201cYou should forget about me. We broke up long ago.\u201d This statement suggests that the individual in question is no longer interested in the person who made this line of dialogue. So, A cannot be the correct answer.\n2. B: The phrase \u201cforget about you\u201d is never used in the statement so the correct answer isn\u2019t B.\n3. C: The phrase \u201cforgetting about\u201d being used as an action, can be used to mean \u201cthe act of paying no attention to\u201d. However, since the sentence that follows it is, \u201cI\u2019m in love\u201d, it implies that they are actually quite interested in said individual. So, B cannot be right.\n4.

My favorite type of music is the sound of singing birds. I am not kidding when I say that listening to a cardinal singing can take away my cares completely. I also enjoy the sound of crickets and chipmunks in the summertime. There is nothing I like better than to go for a long hike and then to sit and listen to the wonderful chorus of nature. My friend Bill enjoys listening to Beethoven and Mozart. He also likes to sing with choruses. His voice may surprise you. It is very strong and his musical ability is great. My daughter Krystal is a very good singer. She has been in musicals and has performed in concerts. Her favorite type of music is folk. She also likes a lot of Broadway songs. My oldest son, Matt, enjoys listening to heavy metal. He will sit and listen to this kind of music for hours at a time, although he will not admit to it.

{"text": "She will have 18 minutes left.\n\n- Explanation: The question asks how many minutes will be remaining in Jessica's hour-long exam if she keeps the same pace she set at the beginning of taking the exam. \n\n- Answer: The first step is to determine how much of the exam Jessica has completed. Jessica answered 16 out 80 questions, meaning that she completed 16/80th of the test. 18 minutes x 0.2 = 96 seconds, meaning that Jessica has completed 96 seconds of the test.\n\n- Solution: We know that she has spent 12 minutes on 16/8th of the exam, meaning that she has spent 72 seconds per minute on that part of the exam. We also know that she has completed 96 second of the exam, but she still has 720 seconds left in her exam hour. In order to complete the test in an hour, she will have to spend the remaining seconds divided by the 60 seconds in one minute. We know the solution = (remaining seconds)/60 = [720 seconds left]/60 = 12 minutes and change.\n\n### Input:\"The customer did not care about you.\" What did you learn from this customer?

{"text": "Avianna has 15 blue candles\n\n### Explaination:\nThis question is tricky. When first reading it, one instinctively wants to assume that if Avianna bought R:3 then she will have R blue and 2/3 blue candles (because 5:3). \nIf this was all we had then the answer would be 30 red and 15 blue candies.\nHowever, there is a second piece of information, in which Avianna stated that she had 45 red ones.\nSo if Avianna had 15 blue and 30 red candles then we must have had 15 / (15 + 30) = 15 / 45 which equals to 0.33. So, we take this result 0.33 and divide that by 3 which would have us to get 0.11.\nIf you try to divide 30 by 11 you get 2.727 which is way off.\nSo now to confirm that you are right you can multiply 45 X 0.33 which is way off. Instead you have to multiply 15 with 2.5 and that will equal to 37.5. So you add 37.5 to 30 which equals to 67.5 red candles which means we got the right answer.", "answer": " 27"}

After she empties each compartment, we are left with 8 pennies. \n\nNow, Roshemina adds 6 pennies to fill up each of the empty compartments.\n\nAfter she fills the first compartment, we are now left with 8 penneys+6pennies. This totals 14 pennies.  We add 6 pennies again to increase the total to 20.\nThis is done for all the 12 compartments.\n\nIn the end, after 2 fillings, we get a total of 20 added to each compartment.\n\n1.

Or 600 which is an even number, so half way in between, is option D.\n\n### Rationales:  (note that some rationales have been omitted)\n- Jose\u2019s cellar has imported/domestic ratio of 13:1, and has 200 bottles left for each ratio, 2400 for imported and 1200 for domestic.\n- 3/4th or 3/5th of the bottles has been consumed from each type.\n- It is likely that half of the total wine is consumed in the function. Which would mean that there would have been 840 to 1000 bottles of domestic wine consumed and 1680-2400 of imported wine was consumed.\n- The bottles consumed would add up to be 2400+1200+240 = 3940 and half of it is 1970, meaning that there are 30199.9 (rounding it off) bottles remaining.\n- Option D has 3000 less bottles, and hence would indicate a wrong answer since it is likely that half has been consumed, 840-597 = 243 was wrongly subtracted since option D used a remainder of 597, leaving off the 243.\n- Option E incorrectly subtracted and rounded too. Instead, rounding off, it should be added to 32541.9\n- Option F multiplied by 2, so the option would now be 600, half way between 30198.9 and 15149.9, since there are 6000 less bottle and 1000 plus bottles of imported wine, the answer is 597 bottles.\n\n### Input : A man wants to go to the restroom.

{"text": "600\n\n### Input : What does the author suggest that someone can do to prevent the water pipe from bursting? Choices: \nA: keep the tap open \nB: don't use hot water \nC: keep the tap closed \nD: turn on the tap \nE: make sure the temperature is cold \n \n### Rationales: \n \nStep 1: We begin by understanding the context of the question. The author suggests in the sentence \"If one pipe bursts, then 300 gallons will leak out\" that if one water pipe bursts, 300 gallon is going to be leaked out. \n \nStep2: Then we identify the action taken in the context. Here the author asks the one who is reading the note from \"someone\" to take the action \"to prevent the water pipe\" from bursting. \n \nIt then follows the question : What does the author imply that someone can do to be able to prevent the water pipe?\n \nStep3: We equate the context to our answer choices using logical reasoning. As we have identified both the action taken (burning a record) and the purpose of taking the action, we can now eliminate choices that are irrelevant. The options 'keep the tap open' and 'turn on the tap' are both actions of releasing hot water, and clearly the context of the question is not related to hot water so they can be eliminated. \n \nNext, considering the context, we can see that if the water pipe bursts, the water released leaks out of the building. Therefore, the purpose of preventing the water pipe from bursts is to stop the water released leaks and that is what the author is trying to suggest for the reader to do. So, we can get closer to choosing the right answer by eliminating the irrelevant answers again. The option 'keep the tap closed' is also irrelevant as \"close\" means to stop the flow and therefore it is inconsistent with the purpose of eliminating the water leak.\n \nIn other words, we get to know that the purpose is to stop the water release and so no hot water or water leak is expected. Therefore, 'don't use hot water' is also eliminated. This leaves us with two options: 'keep the tap closed', and'make sure the temperature is cold'.", "answer": " 300"}

Eliminate extra information. Any information or assumption not required to find the answer can be discarded. \n5. Apply logic to reach the correct answer. Consider the possible answers and eliminate any unlikely choices. Choose the answer that fits the given conditions well.\n\nExample: Consider the text of A pool has 48 \u200b\u200bblue tiles and 31 \u200b\u200bred tiles. If the  pool needs 66 \u200b\u200btiles to be completed, how  many more tiles are  needed? The question asks about the number of tiles needed to complete the pool. First we interpret the given choices and eliminate any wrong answers. Then we apply the logic that a full pool needs 66 tiles. One tile is either blue or red, so a full pool also contains 66 tiles of a particular color that is either blue or red. Eliminating red tiles because there are already more than enough. There are still 66 tiles red and blue. If there are 66 blue tiles, that means we still need 66 white tiles to make a full pool.\n\n## 2.0 Instruction Format\n\nThe instruction format of the test is one or more instruction per question, but the questions itself vary in the number of choices.

{"text": "3000 * 30 = 90,000 visits / 30 = 3000 visits per day\n\n### Input :How many pages in a novel are there? Choices: 99,999 A: 99 B: 99.999 C: 100 D: 100.999\nRationales: The question is asking about a novel. A novel is defined as a long literary work that follows a story or a story-line. \nA novel can have a large number of pages since it can contain a lot of text, dialogues, and plot devices such as chapters and scenes.\nWith regards to pages, it is assumed that one page in a novel equates to one thousand words. The words are arranged into several lines depending on the book type and the format used for publishing it.\n\nIt is also apparent that the options given include numbers and decimal values. As noted in the context, a novel is said to have many pages since it can contain many words and plot devices such as scenes and chapters.\n\nThe first given option is 99, which is a whole number and is not related to the idea of a novel having a lot of pages. Therefore, this option can be eliminated to narrow down better answers.\n\nThe second option is 99.9, which is not related to the number of pages in a novel. This option can be discarded.\n\nThe next given option is 100, which is a whole numerical value. A novel can indeed contain pages of this magnitude but not in terms of individual words. Words can be arranged into different kinds of layouts, depending on the size of the novel. Therefore, the choice of 100 is ruled out.\n\nThe last option is 101, which is a whole numeric value. A novel can contain pages of this magnitude, but it has to be considered in a higher scale. For example, a chapter of a novel is made up of several scenes and thus could potentially contain 101 pages. The author may have divided the chapters such that each chapter contains several scenes.\n\nTherefore, we see that the numerical value is not directly relevant to the given question. The question is about the number of pages, not the number of words. Even though every page may contain 100", "answer": " 10"}

After finding that SAP A-B-T is working normally, the next step is to confirm the correctness and completeness of the SAP. If we look at the data in table 1, we find that the value of 8 is repeated in two of the servers. This information was not obtained from the original input. So, the SAP is not complete.\n2. Next we check the values in the \"ID\" column to determine if they are correct. By this, we mean whether the values are equal to each other or not. The value of \"8\" in the column \"ID\" in server A, means that \"user2\" in server A has access to \"R1\", and that \"R1\" is configured as \"8\". However, looking at the following data, we find that \"user2\" has access to \"T2\". This is because the configuration of \"R1\" in server A is 8. But the value of \"ID\" for \"T2\" in server A is configured with the value \"5\",\" which is incorrect.\n3. The value of \"R3\", which is correctly configured in server A at 5 for the \"ID\" column, is also incorrectly configured for server B for the \"ID\" columns. This is because the value of \"R3'' configured in server B is 8 and not 5. This shows that the data does not have the correct configuration between server A and server B.\n4. The configuration of \"R2\" in server B is also incorrect. The configuration of \"ID\" in server B is incorrect for \"R2\" because it shows that \"user2\" and \"user3\" have access to it.

{"text": "There are 1200 novel pages * 500 papers per ream = 600,000 Sheets.\n\n### Rationales:\nJohn's short stories are 50 pages and he writes three stories per week. Therefore, the total number of short stories per week is: \n\n3 short stories per week * 50 pages per short story = 150 pages per week. \n\nWe know John writes short stories every week which means\nhe must publish at least 150 pages of short stories every week.\n\nWe also know that each short story is 5 pages. This means that the total\nnumber of pages written by John on short stories per month is: 3 * 150.\n\nFrom this, we see that John can write 450 pages on short stories in a single\nmonth. This means he can write 1800 pages on short stories per month. This\nmeans 1800 * 12 weeks = 21,600 short stories.\n\nFrom the given information we can thus say that John must publish 21600 * 50\n= 108,000 pages on short novels every month.\n\nIn every month, John needs 108, 000 * 100 = 181 reams.\nIn every year this number comes down to (181 * 52 = 9528).\n\nOver many years, John needs a lot of reams.

{"text": "The bird feeder can feed 32 birds each week.\n\n### Explication:\n#### Analysis: \nFirst, the question is asking how many birds the bird feeder feeds weekly. The first step in solving this question is to define the term \u2018weekly\u2019. We are given a number of birds (14), a number of cups (2), and a ratio of birds per cup (four:1). These data constitute a week, and if Ivan's bird feeder fed eight birds in each cup, he would have been feeding a hundred birds each week. \nSimilarly, if he is fed a hundred in each cup feeding a hundred each week, and one cup feeds eight birds a week, then the feeder is only feeding one forty-fourth of the birds in one day. So, we can conclude that a week is defined as 14 birds, 2 cups, and 4 birds per cup.\n#### Solution: \nGiven that we know the amount of birds a single cup can feed, we are now given the total amount birds Ivan\u2019s bird feeds weekly. Now, the question is to solve for the amount each cup will feed weekly. We know that one cup can feed 14 birds. So 14 is the amount of birds each cup feeds.\nNow, we are given the time interval a week is divided in fourteen birds. Therefore, it must always feed, which is why we are asked to evaluate it weekly. 14 birds (each cup) \u2261 1 week= 14 weeks= 112 birds\nGiven that birds are divided in two cups, we find the total amount of birds a week is divided in. We know that 14 \u2261 2 cups= 22 birds, which mean 112= 22 weeks. The feeder feeds at least 32 birds for the week.\n\nRationales: Each cup contains birds. Therefore, if one cup of birds can feed two birds, then one day will contain one fourth of the birds, which will be four birds. The 2 cups combined will contain 12 birds per week.\nGiven that the feeder feeds 12 birds per couple, then a week will contain at least 48 (12=24, 24 is double of", "answer": " 21"}

First, we cross out choices that have nothing to do with what can cause a boat to'sink'. These include waves, floods, and humans which have only to do with motion or actions such as sinking and floating.\n2. Rain can also be ruled out, because rain simply increases the buoyancy of a boat so it cannot sink.\n3. Next, let's cross out choices with the action of'sinking' occurring in a natural process.

Choices: A: one hundred B: one hundred and five C: two hundred D: two hundred and five E: four hundred\nRationales:\n1. The number of spokes in the unusual bicycles will be double of the spokes in the regular bicycles as the unusual bicycles have twice as many spokes.\n\n2. There are two regular bicycles for every unusual bicycle as we are told that the unusual bicycles are twice as many as the regular bicycles in the first part.\n\n3. The number of normal bicycles is half as we are told that they are equal in the first part. And the number of spokes are the same as the number of spokes will be equal in both bicycles in the same way as in the number of regular bicycle. \n\n4. And this is true, for if one bicycle has 100 spokes, the other bicycles have 100 as well and so have same number of spokes.\n\n5. Therefore, since the regular bicycles are equal in number, the spokes will be divided in half as well and are same in number in both the bicycles, with this number being 100.\n\n6.

{"text": "Let x denote the final length of the rope by Tony. As he attaches each rope to the rope which was attached at the end, he will be adding 1.2 foot for every knot in terms of lost length. This means that for every two attached ropes, he adds 2.4 feet and so on! Therefore, Tony's rope will be at least the sum of these two lengths and thus, his rope can be approximated as follows:\n\nx  = 8 + 20 + 4 x 1.2 + 4 x 2.4 + 4 x 3.6 + 6 x 4.8 +...\n\nThis can immediately give as an expression of x by using the well-known formula to solve a polynomial of nth degree:\n\nx \u2248 8 + 240 x 5/32 + 3.9 x 5/24 + 0.2 x 25/3440\n\nThis will then give us the first two terms by simplifying the 1st and 2nd terms:\n\nx \u2261  8 + 2490 x 5/2080\n\nBut because we've already simplified it to have the first terms, it isn't a practical value to find out.

So, he bakes his full tray in the morning and eats one cookie every morning. After six days, he has baked 144 cookies and eaten 24.\nThere are 72 remaining cookies from Frank's trays. Since he ate one cookie every day, there should be 71 remaining cookies. But because Frank ate 12 cookies already, there is now one cookie less to be divided. \n\n### Demo:The 8th day is coming up. How much will Frank have to eat after the 8th day if he eats 1 cookie every day while Ted eats 24 cookies per day? \n\n### Rationale:Frank eats exactly 1 cookie every day. If there are exactly 12 cookies in each tray, then all the cookies in the first tray will be consumed by Frank in one day. The same happens with the second tray that Frank finishes the next day. This way, Frank eats exactly 60 cookies in 7 days and Ted has eaten 24 cookies in the same time.\nThe next day, the last 24 cookies and 12 for Frank's tray are finished by Ted and another 12 are consumed by Frank. This way, Frank has consumed 72 cookies in exactly 7 days and Ted ate 48 cookies in 7 days.\nThat means all the remaining 36 cookies for Frank and his tray will be available for him in the 8th day.

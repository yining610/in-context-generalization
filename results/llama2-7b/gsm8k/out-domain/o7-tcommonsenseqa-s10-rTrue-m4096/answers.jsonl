The final profit is $18.\nIn order to answer the question, we need to know what will be the final amount in Mike's pocket.\n7. Solution 1: Mike keeps 5/9 of the profit: $18/9=2.18.\nThe next step is calculating the final profit in Mike's pocket after spending $200 on shirt. As Mike kept 5/9 of profit and spend $200, the final profit in Mike pocket is 4/9 = 0.44.\n8. Solution 2: Mike keep 4/9 of the profit, $18/5=3.6.\nBecause Mike is going to keep 3.6.\nSo the final amount of the profit is 0.44x2, because Mike used $200 and have left $18 so Mike will save $1.4.\n\nInput: What are the main types of wood?

{"idx": 18, "text": "The statement above is a complicated one, but at the core of the problem is an understanding of hard hats and the relationships between pink hats, green hats, and yellow hats.\n1. To solve this problem, begin by understanding the phrase \"and twice as many\". This means that any two hats can be replaced by a single hat, so long as it is twice as large in size or value. This eliminates the question of which hats are being compared as we know that each set can be replaced by a set of the same size or value as the original. \n2. Now we have a more simple problem to solve. We need to calculate the number of hats remaining after Carl takes away 4 hats. This requires basic multiplication and division. We know that Carl took away 4 pink hats. This means there are now 22 pink hats left in the truck. \n3. We then move on to John taking away 6 pink hats and twice as much green as the number of pinks he took away. This indicates that John took away 16 hats. Of these 16, 12 are green and 4 yellow.\n4. In order to find out how many hats remained in the truck (all color combinations), we first multiply the number of green hard hats by 12 and add that to the number of yellow hats. This gives us 152 total hats left after John's taking. \n5. With John's taking of 16 hats, Carls removal of 4 pink hates equals 28 hats, leaving a total of 152 - 28 = 124 hats remaining in the truck. In conclusion, the statement above is calculating the total number of hard'hats that were remaining in the truck, after John's action and Carl's action.\nSo the final result is 124\n\nInput: If a girl is running in a field, how can she get away from being chased?

Usually, abstract classes do not have any specific methods of their own, but they have methods that create subclasses and are able to invoke other methods created by the subclasses.\n\n### Q3: How do we start writing a program using Class?**\n* * *First, identify what the Class will be used for. Then, create a Class object, where we can store the class variables, methods, and functions. We also need to declare the class name and declare class variables/methods/functions. The main function must be written after the class, and it gets invoked at the program start.\n\n### Answer Q3:\n* * *Creating and implementing a function using Classes.\n\n* Create a new Class that can be used to create different types of cars. This will be used for a function that we are going to use later in this program, such as creating the function NewCar. Add the new Class to your program in the same package that the function is in.\n* Declare all the necessary variables in the Class, including the body, engine, and transmission.\n* Declare the main method of the Program. We will use this method to invoke our newly created Class object. The Class object will create a Car instance, which will have all the variables specified in our Class object.\n* Create functions that are able to create other types of cars. Create one function that creates a pickup truck with a standard transmission.\n* Also, add a function that creates a Subaru with a 5-speed manual transmission.\n* Write a function that creates any type of pickup truck.\n* Write the NewCar function. This will be used to create a function that can create various types of cars.\n* Write another function that will create any type of Subaru vehicle.\n* Declare any variables you need outside the Class object.\n* Finally, return True to complete the program execution.

At a competition with 16 rounds of skipping, there are 64 rounds where Jeff could have attempted to skip, with each round requiring a distinct total of skips, and Jeff's skips in each round being distinct.\n2. For each distinct round, we can use the total of skips to calculate an average skips per round which Jeff completed.\n3. Firstly, we can use the number of times Sam and Jeff skipped in each round to calculate the difference in the number of times each player skipped, which will then be reflected on their counts and average numbers of skips.\n4. As Sam and Jeff's counts are 16 and 16, and the difference in their skipping actions is 6, Sam would have skipped 6 less times than Jeff overall, meaning they will have the same total count of 96.\n5. We can set these counts to 0 since Sam and Jeff will count skips as they did at each round.\n6. At the first round of skipping, we can calculate the difference in the amount of skips of each player, which is 1, so Sam skipped 1 less time than Jeff, and Jeff skipped 2 less than Sam.\n7. In the second round of skipping, the player with the least amount of skips is Jeff, because Jeff skipped 3 less times than Sam, so Jeff will skip 2 less times than Sam.\n8. In the third round of skipping, Jeff will skip an 1 more number of times than Sam.\n9. In the fourth round of skipping, neither Jeff nor Sam will skip more times than other.\n10.

From the question, we know that we are working with a craft store that makes third of its sale in the fabric section, and further, that it makes quarter of its sale in the jewelery section, and the rest sales in the stationery section, of which it will make 36(number of sales) today.\nStep 3. To solve for the number of sales in the stationery sections, we will need to look at the fabric sales and the jewelry sales and how they relate to the rest of the sales.\nStep 4. We can see that if there is 36 sales, then there would be 19 sales in the stationery area.\nStep 5. We can verify this answer by going back to the fabric section and counting the sales to arrive at the total sales. From the information provided, 19 out of 36 (19/36) is what we are looking for.\nStep 6. In conclusion, the total sales in the jewellery section amount to approximately 19 out of the 36.\nSo the final answers are 19 out of our 36\n\nInput: What did the woman use in her car from the grocery store?

There are two days, but the first one should be the same for each day, so it has to be the Monday. \nStep 3: To determine the number of cars leaving a given day, we take the number of cars entering each time and subtract it from the number of cars that are entered each time. For Monday we have 82, for Tuesday we have 25, for Wednesday we have 23, for Thursday and Friday we have 10, for Saturday we have 5, and for Sunday we have 0, we have only the first day we need to take off. \nStep 1:  We take 82 - (25 + 20 + 10 + 10) = 20 cars.

If the scenario is that the stamps are first licked and already in the envelops and letters, we are only concerned about how many stamps are needed to mail out what pieces of mail.\nStep 3 If the answer was that the letters are already written and licked, the first thing we should look for is the word \"all\", because what matters is not what is needed to mail everything but what is needed to mail \"all\" everything.\nStep 4 Since we couldn't find any places in the question to plug in the word \"all\", what we should be looking for is the phrase \"except for...\" since something may or may not be excluded other than this.\nStep 5 When we do find \"except for the electric bill\", we can see that this phrase means that all other items are included in the count, so to total all items, we will count all except for the bill which needs 2 stamps.\nStep 6 We know that everything needs 1 stamp but the electric bill needs 2. \nStep 7 Since we know from step 4 that all of the items (except for the bill that needs 2 stamps) are included in the count we'll begin from that side.

If we could get 2 of each item without including the bill then we could subtract 2 from each item (for example subtract 3 stamps from the number of birthday cards, for a total of 5 after subtracting 2), but if we include the bill then we simply need to add 2 (since we know that the bill needs 2 stamps).

We could simply multiply, 3 times 3, and get 9, but is there a shorter way? \nThe second cat mews once in every 30 seconds if I want to do it from the clock perspective, is the same as every 1/30 if I want to do 30 on the cats.  I can take 1/30 and multiply that by 3 because there is the three cats making meows.  The meows that the second cat makes are going to be done at a 30/15 or a 30/20 frequency because the third cat is meowing at one-third the second cats frequency.  There are 9 meows coming from the second cat.  The entire combined set of meows is coming from the three cats. The combined set of meows then is going to be equal to 9 meows times the 3 cats.  The 9 meows times 3 is how many meows the three cated make in 5 minutes.\nSo the final solution is 9 x 3.  33 meows are made by the three cats in 5 minutes. 9 x 3 = 27 meows per 3 cats in 5 mins.

In the given choices, there is only 1 pull-out sofa and only 1 class. Therefore, either the principal will have to put the 3rd student together with the first 2 students in one of the 2 queen beds, or they won't be able to get 3 students in a room.\n4. This is not mentioned in the original statement, however.\n5. In order to make this calculation we'll work backwards and use the question's number of rooms (46) and their respective sizes to work out the number of possible arrangements of students in rooms.\n6. We know from the given choices that options 1 & 2 can fit a certain number of students. Taking into account both options, we know it is possible to fit 2 students in each of the single queen beds, and we also know there are 3 students in the class.\n7. The pull-out sofa can only fit 1 student.\n8. So, the maximum number of students will fit in a room using only options 1 and 2, and not using option 3, is 3 + 2 - 1 = 4.\n9. 46 students divided by 4 rooms is 11, which means it would be possible to fit the entire class of 30 in 11 separate rooms.\n10. In other words, the principal needs to book 11 rooms in order to have an arrangement where every single student is in a separate room and the class fits.\nSo the final answers is 11 rooms\n\nInput: If a woman's hair is wet, how is her hair after it dries out?

We cannot only use 3 to represent 3 families because there are 2 variables which are members and families.\n\nStep 5: Convert the question of \"how many loads of laundromats\" 14*7=98 loads of laundromat because the question doesn't have enough details to solve the question.\nStep 6. We can easily deduct a wrong answer.\nFor 98 laundry, each family can only use a maximum of 12 towels, which has been shown in Step 3, but the last option should be an answer because not everyone in a family is cleaning each day during the vacation, so there it should have been a solution with 98 * 3=294.\nStep 7. There should be only 1 answer, but instead there are 2 answers that are same and cannot be differentiated from each other. For example, if the answer is 98 then it could also be the 98 because the numbers on the question are 294 for each member and the answer to the question of 7*294=1902, so 1902*3=5706.\nStep 8. If there is only a correct answer, it should be either equal to 98 or 294. The answer is 294 because 294 *3=872.\nSo the final solution is D:294 because the answer should be differentiated from other wrong answers, and answer D has been correctly differentiated.", "answer": " 6"}

{"idx": 169, "text": "1.) Given this situation, we are looking to calculate total order price with a 10% discount.\n2.) In order to determine the total order price, start by calculating the price of each individual item.  In this case, this is straightforward as each item is marked with a given price on the sale sign-up.  To determine the total price of the total items, simply add together the prices of each item.  (2 quiches at $15.0+ 6 croissants @ $3.0+ 6 biscuits @ $2.0= $36.0)\n3.) Next, the additional 10% disc is calculated by simply subtracting 10% of the cost of the total items.  In this case for the given problem, the cost of total items is $36.0.  Thus the total discount percentage can be calculated by subtracting.10 from 1(100%) which equals $(100% -.10) or $(90%)\n4.) In the given problem, we simply continue to calculate $36.00 - ($36.00 *.10) which equals $30.\n5.) We found the total discount, which is 10%, to be a positive decimal that is smaller than $36.0 - $30.0 which equals $6.0.

{"idx": 200, "text": "1: We can simplify the problem by recognizing that every payment Gary makes to his father has two aspects to it: (a) the loan interest portion and (b) the principal, or loan repayment portion.\n2. We can also recognize that Gary has a monthly income and that he pays interest on the loan.\n3. By assuming that the interest rate is XY%, we can get the equation for how much he has to pay each month (ignoring compound interest):\nPn = 6,000(1 + XY)^{n/12} - 6,00(X/100)(1+XY)^n/12 for n years\n4. Our original question requires us to determine the interest rate by using the value of the principal payment amount for (2 years - 5 years).\n5. By setting the principal payment in the above equation (Pn) to 1200, we can determine that the required monthly payment is actually 6484.23631 and not 562, as previously calculated from what was given. This is because the principal payment had to start at 580 for the first year to balance out with the interest payment.\n6. The 2 year interval also has a different principal payment of 400, because the principal starts over with the new payment. Our revised answer is therefore 400 \u2a09 1.82231718023677% instead of 562 \u2a09 20%.\nSo the final answer are:\nGary borrowed a total of $6,00\nHis monthly income is $580\nHis monthely payment to his dad is $400\nHis loan had an interest rate of 0.027322317\n\n\n# How to play: \n## Input: The first integer represents the number of queries you want to solve  \n## Output: (queries[i][0] is the question, you can ignore it)  \n## Each next integer represent how many integers are the options, and the final integer is the answer  \n## For example:  \n## 3 2 3\n## 2  \n## 4 5\n## 1  \n## And the answer", "answer": " 150"}

{"idx": 221, "text": "The first way to solve this problem is by using a formula that gives the gas required for the car to run for a certain number of miles. This formula can be given by the equation \\[distance=d\\cdot fuel\\frac{use}{miles}\\]. We already have one end of the equation. Using the information provided, we know that we are traveling 400 miles and also that the car in question is using 20 gallons for every 400 miles it travels. Hence \\[distance=400\\cdot 20\\cdot\\(\\frac{diliters}{kilograms}\\) \\cdot\\(\\frac{miles}{kilograms}\\) = 400\\cdot20\\cdot\\(265\\frac{dilitres}{kilograms}\\).\\(g\\)\\(\\frac{miles.}{kilogram.\\) \\) \\]=45000000g \\(\\frac{miles^{2}.}{kilogram.\\) \\)\\] Therefore, the distance covered is 450 million miles.

{"idx": 226, "text": "Here we have a math question in which a formula for water needs is given. The only thing that is missing is the number of loads of laundry that have to be done. \nThe question asks how many gallons of water would be used with each cycle (with bleach).  \nThere are three different cycles (heavy, regular, and light), with the light cycle having 2X the water used for the heavy cycle and 3X the water used for a regular wash.  \nThus, by counting the number of cycles and the number of loads that need to be bleached, we can figure out the gallons of water needed for each load of laundry: 10X + 10 - 2X = 12, 20X - 10 = 16, 1X + 2X + 3X = 8 cycles, and each cycle needs 2 gal of water for a heavy cycle plus 1 gal of water for a light cycle (if using bleach).  \nIt is not given anywhere in the problem how many loads were done, how many of them were bleached, or how many gallons of bleach were used (which we can assume was mixed in a separate container).  \nThere is only the formula of how many water gallons would be needed per heavy wash cycle, with a light wash cycle added for bleach (i.e. 2Gal + 1Gal). \nHowever, there are 8 cycles needed to do all the washing and we don't have a formula for how many Gallons of water is needed for the other cycles. (We do have a formula given for how much water is needed for a heavy cycle, but that formula needs 9Gal to do) It is left to us to figure out how many gallons of gallons of water would then be used in each load with the given formula that it would be 10Gal of water for a heavy load + 1Gal for a light load.  The answer is that each load would take 11 gallons of water, with (2*11) + (1*9) = 21 gallons needed in each load with bleach used.  \nEach load does not have to be 21Gal.

{"idx": 231, "text": "1st Step:\nStep 1: Consider each group of answer options individually in light of their requirements to identify which options meet or do not meet the question.\nStep 2. Consider option A: eight times. This choice states that Emery can read five time faster than Serena, and eight times as fast equals 80% of her speed. So, they can read \"80% as fast\" as much as Serena can. This means that Serena reads the book 80% of Emery's speed (or four times as fast) and therefore the total time they take to read the book 80/5 = 16 minutes which does not fit our requirement of 20 days.\nStep 3. Consider option B: ten times. This choice states again that Emery can read 5 times faster than Serena, or ten times faster. So, ten times faster means the same thing as 50% of her speed, which is equal to reading twice as fast as Serena. This means that each of them takes 20 days to finish the book and therefore does not meet our requirement.\nStep 4. Option C: five times is a logical option as 5 times faster equals 200% faster than Serena.\nThis means that Emery reads the book 5/1 is 5 times as fast.\nTherefore, we have our correct amount for Emery's reading speed.\nStep 5. Option D: twice. This choice states that the book takes 50% as much time to read for Emery than for Serena, as she reads twice as fast as her.

Subtract the netbooks from the remaining 18 to get the total number of laptops =\n\n\nLet this be = X. We also know from the question that the total number of sold computers is = 72, so X + 72 = 72, and we can substitute = 72-X for X, which gives X = 72 - 72, or X = 0.\nStep 3.

Just note that it's not a true syllogism\nbut is more in the style of the \"Ask me something I know/won't know\".\n\nIt's also a bit more complex than you may notice at first glance.  In fact, it is a\nmultiple-choice question on a true or false basis, not a syllogism.  Note that the\nformat isn't just a list of statements, each one being an unrelated fact.  It also\nappears to be a list of sentences or simple statements that form a short narrative.\n\nSo the format requires some thought.  One key thing to notice is that every\nstatement is one where the answer is pretty much either \"yes\" or \"no.\"  Some\nstatements are ones where even if they contain some information that is generally\ntrue, it's false in this particular context.  In addition, if you consider the\nnarrative as a whole, it's clear that if the answer to any statement is true, then\nthe overall narrative is true.  Thus, the answer to a statement isn't an isolated\nYes/No but rather dependent on the answer to the entire series of previous\nstatements.  Further, the sequence doesn't just seem arbitrary.  The final answer\nis indeed the logical result of the initial statements.  If the final statement is\ntrue, then the remainder of the sequence is correct.\n\nIt's further necessary to realize that the statements don't just seem to be out of\ncontext like sentences from some essay.  One of the statements, e.g., isn't just\n\"D: train station\" it's \"(D) train station.\"  This means that when the sequence is\ncomplete, there will be context.\n\nFurther, the entire format requires some analysis as each question is a logical\nnarrative, but the content doesn't simply repeat the same sort of logic as one\nmight see.

{"idx": 262, "text": "So for the cost of apples and oranges, we need to know three things: The quantity of each fruit we're buying, the cost of each fruit, and the total we spend. There are three different approaches we can take given these circumstances:\n1. Approach 1: To solve this question, first calculate the number of fruits in the basket and the basket price using the given quantities and prices of oranges, apples, and watermelons.\n2. Once completed, determine the prices of the individual fruits by dividing the basket price by the quantity of each fruit.\n3. Finally, use these prices to determine the prices of individual apples and oranges.\n4. Since there are 12 fruits and each fruit costs $0.50, there are 6 apples and 6 oranges in the basket.\n5. Using these quantities, we can calculate the basket price: $66 / (6 apples + 6 oranges) = $0.50 per apple and $0.50 / (6 apples) = $0.25 per orange. \n6. We can now substitute the new values for oranges into our equation to find $\\frac{12\\times0.50-0.25}{12-0.50}\\approx1$.\n7. Thus, 1 apple costs $\\frac{1}{2}$ of 1 watermelons.

{"idx": 285, "text": "1. Assume \"buys\" is the same as \"acquires\"\n2. If we assume \"highest setting\" (which we can do as its specified in the question) as being about 1600 V/s, then it is 60% > 1600, so 2400 vibrations fast in the highest setting of the massager.\n3. We can assume that \"highest setting\" is the maximum speed attainable via this kind of equipment.\n4. At the lowest setting, we can assume the speed is low enough that it can still be considered a vibration.\n5. At a rate of 2400 V/s at the highest setting, and 0.5 * 2400 at the lowest setting (since it doubles at every setting), we can conclude that 1200 V/s is what we'll get in the lowest setting (note that we can multiply 2400 with 0.5 to get 1200 easily).\n6. So we know that at the lowest, 1200 is the maximum vibrations per second, but at the highest setting, they're about 2400.\n7. Now there is a 480 second difference in duration between the lowest and highest setting.\n8. Thus, we have 480 seconds between the settings, and with 1200 as the lowest setting, it means the massager is being used for 480 (seconds) times 1200 (vibrations per second) which is 576,000, the final answer.\nSo the final equation is:\n  \n576,024 = massager_vibrations after 5 minutes.\n\nOutput:\n\n# =====================\n# This code outputs massager_vibrated after 2 minutes, since after 2 minutes we're 25% through and we were using the highest setting.\n\n  # The variables:\n  massager_vibrator = 6000\n  seconds = 2\n\n  # The following statements assume:\n  # - massager has only 2 settings\n  # - the highest setting equals 2400\n  # - the lowest setting equals 1200", "answer": " 768000"}

Choices: 1. flee 2 A. attack 3. change color 4. curl up 5. remain still\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about choices of a lizard's reactions if they are threatened. The list of reactions given includes the following: flee, attack, change colour and curl up.\n2: The first choice is \"flee\". A lizard typically only attacks if it is being cornered, where it is unable to flee.\n3: \"change colour\" would not be a common reaction of a lizard as this would require much more time than a reaction that would involve fleeing or attacking.\n4: \"curl up\" would not be a typical reaction of a lizard either as lizards can typically only curl up to a small degree.\n5: The final choice is a \"remain still\", which is the correct choice since the choices were given in order of commonality, and \"remaining still\" is the reaction most commonly expected of lizards in this context.\nSo the final choice is A. remain still\n\nInput What is the shape of a pumpkin and why it will be?

{"idx": 305, "text": "1. The question is about the share of total water use of an irrigation design which is being specified for three farmers. \n2. As the quantity of crop is given (eg, A: 3 acres of corn), we assume that the quantity of water used to water these crops is based on the weight of the crop (eg, a typical amount of water for an acre of corn is 20 gallons. We can use this assumption to solve the question.\n3. 3 acres of corn uses 61 gallons of water, 3 acres of cotton uses 201 gallons of water and 12 acres 2460 gallons of water (total 2817 gallons of water). If beans use twice the amount of water as usual (total 5635 gallon of water), the total amount of water used to irrigate 17 acres of crop is 8452 gallons.\n4. By dividing 8452 by 3600, we can see that there is 3.11125 gallons of water used to irigate each acre.\n5. To find farmer Bob's share of total water, then, we can take 3.11(12 acres) and multiply by 20 (242 gallons). Total use is 6972 gallons. Farmer Bob's share in the total water used is 32 %.\n6. If we want to calculate Farmer Bob's % of water used (farmer bobs share is 100 / 32 % = 31.25 %, to which we should add 32 %), we can multiply 31.2 % and 8452(irigatable amount) or divide 8452 / 31.2 %.

This leaves us with 51-25 = 26.\n3.) We multiply this value by 4, which is the number of items that Linda bought - 26: 96.\n4.)

We know that John decided to learn how to play piano, he bought a piano at the price of $500, and he hired a teacher for 25 lessons at $4 per lesson.\nStep 3. We also know that John got a discount of 25% from the teacher which reduced the price of each lesson to $3. How much did everything cost in the end?\n\nStep 4. Since John got a 25%-discounted price from the teacher, he can reduce the cost of each lesson by subtracting 0.25 from the original price of $4, which will result in a reduced price of $3.69.\nStep 5. We can then multiply $3.69 by 25 (since John got to take 25 lessons), which equals $91.75 ($3.69 * 25).\nStep 6. Finally, we can add the above $91.74 ($91.75 - 0.25) to the cost of the piano, which equals $500 + $91.77 = $591.77 altogether.\nSo the final result is $591.\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade grade math question.  \nInput:How many pounds of popcorn do you make to make 4 batches of 6 ounces?

Thus the amount of money Daniel will spend on shoes = 80% Of 400\n6. The amount of money Daniel will have to spend on dresses is 60% Of 2000 = $1200\n7. So in total she spends = $120 + (80% Of 800 + 20% Of 2500)\n8. The final amount she will spend = $1920\n\nInput: Do you eat breakfast with someone or do breakfast alone?

Divide the 18 by 12 to get 1. Let's assume that Oscar runs 2 miles each week.\nStep 7 The answer is 14 weeks: Add the current mileage run (2 miles) to 18 (the amount of additional miles to run) to get 20. Divide 14 by the amount of additional miles to reach (20) to get 1.4, which is rounded to 1. In other words, Oscar should start training 14 weeks before the marathon (the last 9 weeks of training and the 9 weeks before the marathon) if he runs 2 miles each time. In addition to covering these 20 miles, Oscar must also maintain this pace of running 2 miles each week during this training period. \nSo the final answer 14!\n\nInput: What should you do if you have bad credit?

We represent this in the form X1 + X2 - (Y1 + Y2). \n4) The question gives us X1 + X2 = 2 X2 (since the second movie is 2 times as long as the first and Joseph and friends spend an equal amount of time watching the movie). \n5) Since we have a variable X2 and that the second movie is 1 1/2 times longer than the first, from basic algebra we can write X2 = 1 1/4x1. (This is because 1 1/5 + 1 1/10 = 10/5 + 10/10). \n6) When we substitute this into our equation: X1 + X2  = 2 X2, we get X1 + X2 + 1 1 4 x1 = 2. \n7) We can solve the equation: X1 = 0.84x1 and plugging this into the equation: X1 + 3/4x1 = 2, we get X2 = 2 1/6. \n8) We can find the value of the variable T = X1 + X2. So (0.84)(0.84) = T.

So what we can do is look for information for which of them can't possibly change in this problem.\nFrom the question itself, the only variable that cannot change is days.\nWhat this means is that at the end of Day 1, pages read must equal the starting page number.\nAt the end of Day 2, page read must equal the pages in the book and the starting page number must equal to the pages read at the end of Day n.\nThus, for Days 2 and greater, we will use\npages_to_read = pages_in_book / number_of_days;\nHere, pages_to_read is the number of pages to be read each day.\nHowever, if number_of_days is greater than 1, then \npages_to_Read / number_of_Days must give us a whole number, as\npages_to_pread / day % number_of_days cannot be allowed so we\nmust find the smaller integer such that pages_to_read / day = 1.\nThus, (pages_in_book / (number_of_days + 1)) - 1 will be used as the pages_to_read.\nFinally, the starting page number is equal to pages_to_read * days + the starting page number.

{"idx": 552, "text": "1: The problem describes Arlene's hiking activity, including the backpack she was carrying and her height. \n2. We know that her average hiking pace must be between 2 and 6 hours. Arlene hiked for six hours, so her pace was at most six hours per mile.\n3. We can deduce how heavy her backpack was given that she was hiking 24 miles with it.  She must have weighed at least 30 pounds, or else she would have been unable to complete this hike. If we take 30 pounds as our lower limit, her backpack was at least 30, and since it was likely heavier, we may assume it was more than 30 pounds.\n4. From her height of 5 feet, we know that her backpack weighed at least 60 pounds. The backpack was at least that heavy, and that she was carrying it for at most 60 miles.\n5. This is the only information we have to work with. We can solve the question using the basic fact that hiking speed is determined exclusively by the weight of a backpack and by the length of the hike. Based on this, we can say that her backpack required (60-x)/x = (60*6)/24 which simplifies to 20/6 which equals 3.333 miles per hour.

{"idx": 562, "text": "The statement \"Betty is the oldest person in her family\" gives us some important clues as to the structure of this question.\nFirst, we can see that Betty is the oldest person in a family, meaning there must be other people (for example, her children and grandchildren) who are younger than her, but her identity is not provided among the others.\n\nSecond, we are given that her daughter is 40% younger than she is, which means they are 40% apart in age.\n\nThird, we are given that Betty's granddaughter is 3 times her daughter's age, which means Betty is 3 times her granddaughter's age.\n\nPutting these clues together, we can work out that Betty is 60 years, Betty's daughter is 40, and Betty's granddauhghter is 19.\n\nIf Betty is 60, that means she's 4 times as old as Betty's daughter. This gives us Betty's daughter's age.\nHowever, Betty's daughter needs to be younger than Betty, which means Betty's daughter is at most 3 times the original age of Betty.\nThis means Betty's daughter'S age is 12 as there are three of 40 to 12.\n\nOnce we have Betty's daughter' age (12), Betty's daughter' daughter needs to be 12 multiplied by the fraction of her mother's age as a fraction of Betty's age (0.33) (12 x 0.33).

So lets just say he jumps 0.1 faster.\n\nNow we have average jumping speed 0.1 faster (lets say 1.5) because of his jump speed was increasing he is more likely to go farther.\n\nso we'll take this one now:\n\n0.1 faster 1.5 = 1.6\n\nNow with the extra \"push\" he is able to catch the ball and he's gaining energy for it so he's going to jump much farther so we need to take into consideration this new \"push\" when we solve for his jump speed and the height of his jump, and\n\nthis is the way: for each jump of height of 5 he is able to jump 0.1 faster so:\n0.1 faster time 5 = 4.5\nand this means that he has an average of 4.5 jump in meter, which will be 4.5 meters plus the speed is able to jump more (", "answer": " 240"}

Using the same logic, it cannot be the case that 15 families each contain two dogs. Each family can have up to one dog as their maximum, and we know that each family owns at least one dog (because there are 20 families that own at least one). Therefore, 15 families cannot own two dogs each.

In other words, after driving half way around, what is the total number of miles he has already driven?\n2. Since our answer will be obtained by dividing the total distance by two, we need to first calculate the total distance Tony needs to drive.\n3. Let this be D, and this distance is comprised of the three distances: grocery store (x), hair salon (y) and hospital (z).\n4. Since D is the total distance he needs to drive, 1/2D will be the number of miles he will have traveled when he is half the distance around.\n5. For example, imagine D = 20 miles and he has started from point A.\n6. If he drives 10 miles to grocery store and is halfway through his errands, then he has covered 10/2*20 or 10/2 = 5 miles.\n7. 5 miles are the total distance he covered when he is halfway finished with his errands.\n8. Thus, we can conclude that the number of miles Tony has covered when he is half the distances around, 1/2 of the total miles he needs to travel D is 1/2D.\n9. In other words, we can say the total number of miles Tony needs to drive are D, and the number of miles he covered when he is 50% through his errands is 1/2 of D.\n10. There is no 5 in D, so there is no such 5 mile.\n11. Therefore, no matter what the numbers of Tony's errands are, his total covered distance is D/2.\n12.

We can then estimate the time Pete can take from his place to the train station and the time to board a train from there. We can estimate that this will take about 50-55 minutes. This estimate takes into consideration the time it might take to purchase a train ticket, travel to the train station, and find your train's platform in good time.\nStep 4. We can then estimate how long it takes for Pete to travel from LA to his place at a speed of about 60 mph (97 kmph) for 1 hour or 20minutes.\nStep 5. We can then estimate when Pete needs to leave to arrive at his destination on time.\nStep 6. We can use our estimate on the time it takes to travel to the train station from Pete's house, the time it takes Pete to travel from the train station to LA, and our estimate on the time Pete needs to arrive in LA to calculate our estimate on when Pete should leave.\nStep 7. We can then present our estimate in the form of a table to make the estimation simple and easy for others to understand.\nStep 8.

The next line states that he is given \"250 feet\" for free. Now we know that he got to use \"250 feet\", which means that he has $8250 to \"buy\" the remaining 50 feet. $8250 / 50 = $165.\nStep 5.

{"idx": 683, "text": "The question has a certain pattern that can be used to identify what is probably being asked. \"saved\" can either refer to earnings or expenses. If $10 per month was saved, that means $100 was deducted from her spending. Similarly, if \"saved\" refers to expenses (as in earnings), then $10 per month spent is $100 less than if no savings were recorded. \nAnother pattern we can identify from the question is that expenses in the question are always subtracted from a monthly amount, such that \"saved\" indicates an amount deducted or a minus sign. Because the amounts are in a sequence from January to December, we can conclude that \"saved\" indicates a deduction from expenses. \nIf we assume that $10 was saved in January, and $15 was saved in August to November, it is reasonable to deduce that Roe earned $55 in August, and $45 in September and October, because she made $50 per month, but saved $15 each month. \nTo solve this, we first calculate the total net income. From the above deduction method we can conclude that she made $70 in January. Therefore, the total net income is $100 in January + $70 + $10 + $15 + $15 +$15 + $45 + $45 = $150 in total. \nBecause the question is about the amount to save in December, it must be possible to know the total net income she made throughout the year. So, subtracting her expences from the total net income and then subtracting $15, she should subtract $15 as she only needs to subtract the amount that she needs to save that will sum to $150. \nTherefore, the answer is $95.86.\nSo the final savings is $150\n\nInput: What do you call a person who studies the past?

So the final answer is 12.25 GB (13107.2-768)/2^10\n\nInput:Why did they cut and paste these into blank pages? Calculate the time to do this.\nOutput:In a book the first page has a total number of 1024 pages. Out of these 1024, 41 pages are blank. That is, the total number of pages is 983 and their cumulative value to sum up is 975024. Now we need to subtract the blank pages. This makes the summation 684200 and the difference is 3024. So the book has 1013 pages. Since \"to do this\" refers to \"cut and paste these\", it's not something that takes the whole time to do and so the answer is 0.3 ms i.e. 30 ms\n\nInput: Why did they copy the book onto the computer?

Choices: \nA: security software B: an office C: a guard D: a lock E: a monitor\nOutput:\nStep1:Considering the options given, it is necessary to identify what exactly we can use to stop a computer crime. \nStep2:There are many possible solutions to stop a computer from a criminal activity. \nStep3:A computer is not necessarily a physical object. It is made up of a circuit board and chips in which software and hardware are stored on. To stop a computer being stolen, one must prevent the hardware and software from being stolen. \nStep4:If someone steals a physical computer with a monitor, they do not suddenly have access to all the software on the computer, which is why they usually make copies or backups of them. \nStep5:Security software and an office is not usually the first solution to come to mind when thinking about computer theft, but software and hardware exist only when there is sufficient space to store them on a certain device. A computer typically has a special chip with space allocated to it. So if we consider the options B and D, they do not actually prevent the computer being stolen, only the contents of it. \nStep6:A guard, as an option, is unlikely to stop a computer from theft as a person can access the software and hardware on a computer even without stealing it. A guard is more of a security system or service to stop a physical crime. \nStep7:We are left with the option C: a lock. This can stop a thief from taking the computer because the computer is held closed by a lock (similarly to how desk drawers are prevented from being opened by a lock).\nSo the final answer, the only correct option, is C: a lock.\n\nInput:What animal needs to protect itself from the elements?

We also know that Anya has more than twice as many erasers than Andrea (based on: \"Anya has 4 more times as many erasert, and Anya has 4 more erasers as Andrea\").\n4. We need a proportion to help answer this question. We can express Anya's eraser count as 4 times Andrea's: 4:1.\n5. To compute the answer, we need to know two ratios, namely, the ratio of Andrea's eraser count to Anya's (\"Anya has 4 x more erasers as Adera\" = 4::1) and the ratio of how many times more erasers Anya has relative to Andrea.\n6. So, Anya has 4 x Andrea's eraser amount, and Anya has (4::1) more eraser amount than Andrea, then the total amount of erasers Anya will have will be (4 x (4::1)) that is, 16, while Andrea will have 4, therefore Anya has 16 times more eraser amount than Anya.\n7.

This makes a dough ball of 225 kg (500 pounds) the worlds largest.\nSecond, convert all the costs to the same currency, pounds. The costs are in units of pounds, so keep these numbers as is.  However, the amount of cash needed is in pounds and that number you must convert to pounds, not kg.  Convert pounds of flour and salt into pounds (lbs) and keep the tickets as they are.  These will be the ones to enter in the calculator for finding the total cost.  So, from these numbers, the total cost of the goods =  (182 x 2) pounds of flour.  This equals $404.00 (404 lbs. of flour at 20$/lb). Next, find the promoting everything cost, 1000 dollars.   Multiply the promoting everything cost ($1000) x 25/100 to obtain pounds (1000 x 25/40).   This is equivalent to $135.00 pounds of flou.  Next, find the 500 tickts @ 20 dollars each.  This comes to $10,000 total.   Multiply this cost by 500 to obtain 500000. Then, multiply the tickets x 25/20 to obtain kg.  You get 5000250 kg or 5050.25 kg.  Convert this to pounds ($10,00 x5050.50/25.00 = $404.25 lbs.)

They start by getting 3 apples. They spend most of their money on the hummus, and they are left with 1.5 dollars. They don't get apples, because now they don't have enough money, and they spend 1.5 dollars more on hummus.\nSo one could say that the answer is that Joan is buying no apples, because they only have 1.5 dollars left. But she still wants to buy them. She has 1.5 dollars, and she has 3 containers of hummus. Let's say she spent all her budget, and she got no apples. Her left-over money, in this hypothetical scenario, is only 1.5 dollars from buying 3 containers of humous for 15 dollars. She already spent about 55,40 dollars of the 60 dollars she has. So by the end of the question, she only has 50,10 dollars, while she still needs to buy 2 containers of humous and buy apples, too. Let's say the containers of humus are 13 dollars, then, if she has 1.500 dollars, she could buy 4 containers of humus. But then, she has to buy 1 container, which would be 0,600 dollars remaining because she didn't have enough of a budget to buy all she wanted to buy, which was, on the end of her list, 8 apples, which is 3 dollars. So she would pay 59 dollars of hummus, so she needs 30 cents that she does not have. She has 1 apples left, and she has to put her container of humus. So she has to go without some of the hummus", "answer": " 5"}

Answer B is 8 pounds, which means it cannot be used as an answer, because the problem specifies that we must use 18 yards of 18, and one yard of ribbon weights about five grams.\n3. Answer C, 16, yields a total of 16 yards of ribbon after 8 gifts are made. This is incorrect because we must use 12 yards of ribbon to make the 6 gifts, and not 16.\n4. Answer A, 8, is incorrect because of the same reason cited above.\n5.

In decimal place.\nOutput: The sum of the digits of a number in base-10 notation is written using individual digits from base-10 numerals, which represents numbers in decimal notation. \n2. This question is asking for the number of digits in the base-ten notation of a given number.\n3. There are 2 ways to derive the answer to this question:\n    a. Add up the number of individual digits in the given number and then subtract the number obtained from the question.\n    b. Subtract the given number from the sum of its individual digits and then divide this number by 10. \n4. In case a, we can write the difference as -x-x, where x= the given number.\n5. In case b, we can write the number =n - x, where n= the sum of all digits.\n6.

Since there are 1,609344Km in 1miles, then 50 x 2 = 100 miles. One kilometer = 0.62Miles => 100Miles x (1Km/0.62Mi) = 164.58Mi.

{"idx": 821, "text": "$18.\nStep by Step Process: 1. We have $100 to pay and that is for the entire meal. 2. So we need to divide $100 among 3 people, James, his friend and who they are with (and we don't know who). 3. James orders $16 meal and his friend ordered $14 meaning James's $16 is covering about $8 (which we need to add to our $14). 4. So the $22 we now have is for James, his friend who ordered $14 is now being paid $7.80. 5. So if we take ($100 minus $8), the tip is $92. We don't know how much each is paying but we know the tip is $9.60 and we do know the person pays a total of $18. 6. We can solve for the total and find that each paid $9. So $9 is the value of \"James's half.\"\nInput: You are buying for some money, but you need less?\nOutput: The question is asking about money and how a person can buy something, but needs to spend less than the full amount.\nStep by Step: 1.

{"idx": 823, "text": "Step 1: The first thing that needs to be done is to break the question into parts, which are:\nQuestion 1: \"Cupcakes are packaged in packages of 15\".\n\nQuestion 2: \"Jean bought 4 packages of 15 cupcake\".\n\nQuestion 3: \"If she gives one cupcake each child in an orphanage, how much packs of 11 cupcakes should she buy from the shop to meet her demand?\" \n\nStep 2: First thing to do at this stage is to identify each question, break them down into variables for simplicity, and find the required information in the question to solve each variable.\n\n(1) For the first question, cupcakes are packaged 15:1, so from this we know that there is one cupcake in each package of 15, or we can say that each cupcake is one fifteenth of the 15 packaged cupcakes for one package.\n\n(2) For the second question, Jean bought 4 packages of cupcakes, so there are 15 cupcaked in all (4 packages of 10 x 1 cupcakes).\n\n(3) For the third question, we are told to give each child one cupcake as we can\u2019t distribute cupcakes with multiple in an orphanage. So, there would be 100 children each holding a cupcake.\n\nStep 3: When dealing with percentages or proportion, percent is not a suitable unit to use. For example, the question states that one cupcake was given to each 100 children, but a 100 is 0.001. We need a bigger unit, and the most appropriate unit is a hundred, i.e. a hundred cupcake should be given 4 packages to one child in an orphan age. 0.004 * 100 = 4. Therefore, 4 packages are needed.\n\nSo the final answer to part (3) is 4 \n\nInput: What do you call someone who is in a relationship with a friend? Choices: 1.

This gives us a frame for where to start.\n3.  We then calculate the cost of the frame itself.  The frame costs $75.  And we know from the question that we have to multiply it by 10 to get the cost of the bed.\n4.  This would give us $750 for the total cost of the bed and frame.\n5.  We then proceed to calculate the price of the bed and bedframe after a discount.  We have a purchase of $875.00.  We can get that by multiplying $750.00 by 125%.\n6.  The next part then is a little trial and error, and it may change depending on your numbers.  But after a minute, you'll realize that you multiply $75 by 8 to get to $600.\n7.  So then, we add 600 to our discounted price.  $600+ is a total of $1475.00 after the discount\n8.  We then remove the discount. So after 20%, take the percentage from the total price to be about 80% of what we started with.\n9.  This gives us $1187.50.

So we need to figure out how much we're already consuming. We know from the problem statement that 2500 of the 25000 calories we eat per day, about 10%, are from added sugar. That would equal 125 calories per day from sugar added to our food. Therefore if it takes roughly 5 calories of added sugars from soft drinks to equal 1 added calorie from candy, we need 25 to get a hundred percent.\n4) Mark would need to consume 25 * 2,250 calorie per day from soft drink and candy. Therefore we need to multiply 25 * 15.\n5) We need to find out how many soft drinks Mark's intake is. As we know soft drinks have 5 calories of sugar for every 1 calorie of candy. We can find this by dividing 25 by 2.5. We find that Mark's soft drink consumption is 10. So Mark would be taking 10 * 15 candy bars, which equals 150.

Let's start by labeling this information as \"X\" and \"2X\".\n2. X can be the number of people that got on after the first stop, and \"2X\" can be the number of getting on and off people at each stop.\n3. When we solve the equation 2X = 1, we get X = 1/2.\n4. This means that when X is 1/2 of the total number of people on the route, half of them will get off and half of them will get on.\n5. Using this information, we can easily work out how to solve this particular question by simply counting the number of people onboard and subtracting that from the total number of people getting on and off.\n6.

Choices:  B: coffee shop C: restaurant D: candy store E: grocery\nOutput: Step 5: From the answer choices we can see that E: grocery store or A: Bakery are the best match for the question. The question requires a context or setting of the cupcakes which will include the bakery. Additionally, each answer choice mentions a certain bakery type which has a more general bakery context as compared to cake shop. Grocery, candy, and coffee shops do not require cupcakes to stay in business, as their primary businesses require different products and foods. The question would be the same if we changed it to \"How are cupcakes sold by a bakery?\" As we can see, each answer choice has varying degrees of association with cupcakes.\nStep 6. We can further narrow down our options by looking at the answer for \"What kind of bakery produces the most cupcakes?\", which will give us a clearer comparison. The answer is \"Bakery\", so we will keep this in the options for the next portion of the question. When comparing the answer choice that mentions a specific store and bakery type, the choice that includes more detailed information is \"Coffee shop\". Coffee shops focus primarily on coffee, however they are also known to provide a limited range of small baked goods to sell such as cupcakes. Therefore, out of all the answer choices, we have \"Bakery\" and \"Coffee shop\", therefore we will include these in Step 8.\nStep 7.

We have to multiply the number of people that each friend actually brings since they didn\u2019t specify whether these people were friends or their individual guests. \n4.

This is because we now have 288 friends, 162 of which can bring two friends and 120 of which can bring another friend, meaning we have 84 friends to add in the previous iteration. \n8. This is the value by which we would have to multiply seven friends by twice to make a sum for the total number of guests equal to 136, which is what we achieve in the seventh iteration.\n9.

If Djibo's younger sister is already 16 years old, then Djibo is 7 years younger than his younger sister.\n3. Let's first consider the younger sister. We are told that 5 years ago, she was added to Djibo's age, which results in the sum being 35.\n4. If we assume that the question means that the additions were done using only the years of age (no months), then the sum cannot be 35. This would mean that DJibo is 33 years old and his younger sister is 14. If we add Djibo to the younger sister's age of 14 (to get her current age), then the sum will be 32, which is incorrect.\n5. The only way 5 years ago the sum could be 35 is if they add the years and the months.\n6. Therefore, it turns out that the younger sister is 36 years old, but we are only considering her years of age.\n7. The older sister is 22 years older than her younger sister.\n8. Therefore, the older sister is 65 years old.\n9. Now for Djibo. He is 17 years of age.\n10.

{"idx": 963, "text": "We know that dough is rolled out across a surface to make these biscuits. We know both that she made square and that the biscuits are 3 inches by 2 inches. Therefore, one side of dough = 3 inches. She must multiply 12 to its own width in inches and that will be its length or its \"thicness\". Therefore, this dough would be 12 by 12. Next, she multiplies it by.5 for the recipe, which shows that the dough is rolled 6 times which is equal to 6. We can subtract 6 from 12 to realize that she has left herself half the amount of room at the top and the bottom of her dough sheet to roll the dough down to her desired size. We can multiply 6 by that.5 which we found earlier to deduce that we have 3 square inches left at the top and the base of the 12 by 2 dough sheet. 3 + 3 = 6, and this is enough to make 6 biscuits. Therefore, we can answer this with the exact answer of 6.

{"idx": 965, "text": "1) We are trying to determine how many more wings Alan must eat per minute to beat the world record.\n2) There are two methods of solving this question:\na. First, let's just solve for the number of minutes Alan must eat wings in order to beat Kevin's world record. We know from the question that the record is 64 wings in 8 minutes, so this gives us the equation 60 mins = 64 wings. Dividing 60 by 64 to get the decimal amount of time to eat a wing, we have the answer of 0.961 as the minimum amount of time to eat one wing.\n3) From here, we must solve for how many more wings Alan can eat per minute to beat that minimum amount given. We know he must eat more because he is currently able to eat just 5 wings in a minute. We are not given how many wings he can eat after just 5 wings per minute, but we do know because 5 is half of 64 (Kevin's record) that he can eat at least 64/2 of 5 wings in a single minute (since the minimum number of minutes to eat the 64 is 0.96 as before), which is equal to 32 wings in a minute. Increasing this by a factor of X, where X will be that additional number of wings he must eat per minute to overcome that minimum, we get an equation of 32 + X = 64. Dividing 32 by 64 then also gives us a value of X at 9.6 as the actual additional number of wings he will have to eat per minute to break the minimum time of 0.9 seconds.\n4) Now that we have the number of wings he must increase per minute to beat the minimum time, we can get his hourly record by multiplying that amount of wings with the amount of minutes:\n5) The answer is 568, which is the number of wings Alan can now eat in an hour to beat Kevin's current record.\nSo the final number is 568.", "answer": " 4"}

{"idx": 984, "text": "2. First, we assume that the heights have been written in inches. The problem with the height of the dog and Betty, together with the information that Carter is twicetaller than the dog and Betty is shorter than Carter, the problem reads\n(6 x 24) + (12 x 12) = height of Betty in feet. We now make Betty 12 inches shorter than Carter and then multiply 24 by 2, since Carter is twice as tall as the dog. To simplify, we multiply 24 by two, since this is twice as tall as 12. Hence, Betty is (6 (2 x 24)) + (12 x (6 -12 x 2) feet tall. Hence, (6 x 24)+(12 x 48) = height of Betty.

If someone asks you this question, don't guess or take a chance, choose the following options A-E and get it right!\n2. Forward and backward chaining, when applied to this problem, will show how to quickly go to the end choice of the puzzle. \n3. Forward chaining is where you can start with any response, and the other options are checked if it is right or wrong. If wrong, you then use back chaining. Back chaining works in exactly the opposite way as forward chaining.\n4. Forward chaining starts from the last choice (E) and checks the other responses if it is correct or not, if not it back chains to the options of the next choice.\n5. For example choice (E): work, then (D): loyalty, then (C): time, then (B): honesty, then (A): money. \n6. You see why the chaining works by trying these options out. \n7.

{"idx": 993, "text": "1: First, we need to identify every piece of information given in the problem.\n2. Hannah is making banana mush. The mush must be the consistency required to be considered to be bread, which is typically a wetter, less thick version of baked goods typical to be found on American dinner tables. Therefore, a banana mush must be quite moist.\n3. Hannah uses 3 cups of mush for every cup of flour used. This means that for every cup of mush, she uses three cups of flour, and the flour she uses is the one she needs to make the entire batch of mush. \n4. To make a cup of mush, it takes 4 bananas.\n5. For every cup of mush she uses to make her bread, she uses 3 cups (the flour she needs), and for every cup of flours she uses for the bread, she can use 4 bananas. \n6. From this, we can calculate that for every cup of flou, she can eat only 1 banana. Therefore, she needs 20 bananas in total, which we can represent as the following equation C of mush/B of bananas = 3 : 1 \n7. Now, we look at the final part of the question: if Hannah uses 2 cups of mush, how many cups should she use of flour? \n8. We should plug the numbers from the previous equation into this one: C of mush/2 : 4 =? C of mush = 2 * banana = 8 banana C of mush = banana \n9. Now, from the final equation we can observe that she only needs to use 8 cup of mush, but this can also be represented as a fraction in its simplest form: 2 : 4 = 1/2 because there are two cups and four bananas, meaning the cup of mush is half the amount of banana.\n10. Thus, Hannah will need to use one and a half or 1.5 cup of mush for every 4 cups of flour. Therefore, Hannah should use 3 cups + 1.5 cups, making 4.5 cups of flour total to make the same cup of mush it would.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "One possible solution to the given question is: 19 (Total): Purple+Yellow: 10Y+80P, Total P: 5Y+20P.\n  The first step is to determine the total number of flowers in the garden, which can be determined by adding the number of each color of flower.\n  As the question states, there are ten yellow flowers, eighty percent more purple than yellow flowers, and twenty-five percent fewer number of green flowers than yellow or purple flowers.\n  This information can be used by setting up the following proportional relationships: yellow+yellow: 80+10=10 x yellow; yellow+purple: 80+5=5 x purple; purple+purple: 50+5=50; green+green: 5+0.25= (5+2)+ yellow;\n  yellow+purple: (5+2)*1 x yellow+green: yellow+2 x yellow+purple: green +4 x yellow+purple;\n  Substituting these into the equation, we can get:\n   19=80 x yellow+purple+purple-purple=10+50+purple-purpe.\n  Thus, there are a total of 19 flowers in the given garden.\n\nInput:The distance between 2 points on a two-dimensional straight line is 6 units.

How many cups of cream should you put on the cake for a total cost of $6.85? Assume the whipped cream costs the same no matter how much is put on the cake.\nOutput:\n\n1. The task is to calculate the number of cups of cream which should be on the cake which when placed on it would result in a total cost of $7.\n2. The cake costs $5 and the cost per cup of cream is $0.4 so it should not matter how much cream is put on the cakes.\n3. Therefore, a total cost of $5.85 does not tell us the price per cup of cream.\n4. In order to determine this amount we need to find the total price (T) of the item and the number of units of the item that we will use in the item.\n5. We can use the equation T = u. p so T = 1.0. (5.85 + 0.4)\n6. Therefore T is equal to 7.29 dollars for each cup of cream. We assume cream cost the same no matter how", "answer": " 320"}

{"text": "The question is about determining how many loads of laundr y will be required to clean beach towels for six families each consisting of 4 individuals.\n\nThe number of oversized beach tows will be calculated by multiplying the number of families by four, each of which will require an oversized towi for each day. To simplify the question, it can be split into stages to determine how long it will take to wash towels from 6 families and the frequency of washing to determine the number of possible loads of towels.\n\n1. Each day of the vacation requires an oversize towel, each of which can use towels washed on a previous day. This creates a linear relationship between days and towels, which means that at four days they should be used for washing the same number of towels. For the first day they only require 6 towels. This means that the next day each family requires 4 washed towels (6 days + 1 towel /day). This also suggests 4 families with 4 members each. There are approximately 6-14 families, 4 family members in each family, which means 2 \u2013 8 people per load.\n\n2. Assuming a frequency of 3-14 loads per day for approximately 6 families, the total number of loads per day will likely be around 30\u201360. However, this number is lower given that each family will only be using two oversized towels for their entire trip.\n\n3. The total number of loads per trip can also be found by assuming a frequency of 40 loads per day for approximately six families and 4 individuals in each family. This would result in at least 34 towels per load and a round number of 140 loads per day. This indicates a total of 140-900 loads for the entire trip.\n\nOverall, it should take at least 30 loads of laundry due to the requirement of at least 4 individuals, making it roughly 1-2 months of vacation. Since it is impossible to wash more than 14 towels in one load, at most it could take a maximum of 2 \u2013 28 days.\n\nSo the final answer might be: C: 1 - 28 days", "answer": " 6"}

The goal of this question is to determine the length of time that a turtle needs to wait before starting a race to ensure that it can finish a race on an equal footing with a hare.\n2.

Given this, the hare is significantly faster than the turtle, and will have a significant advantage in the race if the competition begins at once.\n5. To ensure an equal finish, the turtle must be 20 seconds ahead of the hare, since 20 feet is double the distance from 10 feet to 1 foot.\n6.

To find the length of each side of the square, we multiply the total area by four, knowing that a square with sides of length 4 has an area of 16 square feet (2 x 2 x 2 = 16). We then find the area of the square divided by the 121, which yields the length of the sides as 41 feet.

Therefore the answer has to be 16 because 49 is a third of 33.\n8. One of the benefits of completing a multiple-choice question is a chance to review your answers.\n9. Using this strategy, you can eliminate the incorrect answers that are not 16", "answer": " 220"}
{"text": "1. The information provided in the question involves details about the time spent by a fictional character named Carlotta practicing, throwing tantrruns, and singing.\n2. The question is framed as a math problem, implying that the question is about computing time spent and that the character's actions can be broken down into multiple parts.\n3. Choice B is the best answer choice because it provides the best possible estimate of how much time the character spent on each activity based on the information provided.\n4. The character's time spent practicing can be estimated as 6 x (3 / 6) = 30 minutes by multiplying the number of minutes she spent practicing (3) by her ratio of practicing time to total time on stage (6 / 6), and similarly her time spent throwing tantrums can be estimated as 18 minutes ((3 min + 5 min)/4).\n5. Therefore, the total combined amount of practice and throwing tantrums = P x (P*T)/T + T =18 + 30 = 48 minutes.\n6. The character's actual performance time on stage will thus be (6 + 48)/12 = 12 minutes, and thus the total time spent by the character on stage including rehearsals and stage time will be 12 minutes + (6 + 40)/12 = 50 + 14 = 64 minutes, as 6 minutes of stage time is included in the character's 12 minute total performance time.\n7. The correct answer is therefore the choice (C) which is 12 minutes total stage time, plus 64 minutes rehearsal time and tantrums.\n\ninput:a pig is 2 seconds longer than a goat.A goat is 3 seconds longer than a cat.A cat is 5 seconds longer than an elephant.A pig is 4 times as long as a cat.If 2 seconds > 3 and 3 > 5, how long is an elephant?\noutput:\n1.

These can either be multiplied with each other or divided by each other to obtain the answer.\n5. The correct answer would be the lowest possible value of the multiplication or division of two factors, which provides the best estimate for the earnings.\n6. Therefore the answer would be 24- or 180- as these are the lowest values of the multiplication or division.\n7. The final answer is 180. So the final answer is 1 x $5 per period.\n\nInput:A math teacher offers a 5 % discount on all products. A friend had bought a book which originally cost $120. How much would be the discount given on the discounted price?\nOutput:1. Answers can be in percentages or a fraction of the original price.\n2. This question specifically asks for the amount of the discount, which is provided in fraction format.\n3. The original price of $120 must be the basis for calculating the discount percentage.\n4. Therefore, the friend received a discount of $6.00 because the final price was $114.00 after the discount.\n5. Therefore, $120 * 0.05 = $6\n6. So the final answer would be $6.00", "answer": " 3600"}

To determine the ideal departure time, we need to factor in both components, which means considering the total time required as well as any additional waiting time at any other stations.\n3. The total walking time and train time work out to 2 minutes and 55 minutes, respectively. However, there is an additional 40 minutes to factor in to consider the time required to walk from the station to your destination in Los Angeles.\n4. Subsequently, the estimated total time required to make the trip would be 2845 minutes, or 47.67 hours.\n5. It's clear that there is not enough time even if we add the extra walking time to the 1:20 minutes, we would still need 40 extra minutes which can be easily missed if Pete didn't leave at a precise time.\n6.

The provided information does not indicate what each ounce of vodka contains, but we can determine this by assuming it contains 50% pure grain alcohol, or 100 ml (choice A).\n4. 100 mL refers to 100 milliliters, not 100 millimeters (choice C).\n5. So, we know that each shot contains 50% (or 100 mls of grain alcohol mixed) in a (1.5 ounce) alcohol shot, or 75 ml (choice D).\n6. So, to determine how much pure alcohol he drank we subtract the amount of grains in each shot (75 ml) and multiply the remainder (125 ml) by the percentage of alcohol in Jake and his friend's shots of vodika (50%).\n7. The final answer is 625 ml/3 cups, or exactly 200 ml/1 cup of pure alcohol.\n8. So, the correct answer is D: 75 ml, multiplied by 50% 125 ml, which equals 625 m.\nSo the answer is D: 625 mL of alcohol. \n\nInput: You are out of coins.

{"text": "1. The question is asking how many chocolate squares Jenny ate, given that Mike ate 24 and that the answer should be divisible by 5.\n2. There are two parts to the answer: the first is the variable 'x', which represents Jenny's number of chocolate bars, and the second is '5(x)' which is the number of chocolates Jenny ate that was more than what Mike ate, which was 20.\n\n3. Given these concepts, it is known Jenny ate more than 20 chocolates, and that her number of chocolate bar must be divisible by 3, and that it must not be too high, or the question would imply that Mike ate a higher quantity (e.g. 33 chocolate bars), or that it should be divisible by five (24 is divisible by five), and Jenny might have counted the chocolate bars incorrectly, or that Jenny ate fewer than 20 choccates (36 is not divisible by five), however, this is not the case.\n\n4. So if we let j represent the numerator in 'x' and n represent the denominator, the total becomes 3n+6, and since Jenny is said to have eaten'more than thrice', this implies j+n must be divisible by three.\n5. Moreover, given that the number of chocolahe bars that jenny ate is more than Mike's, it must be more than 20, so it must be divisible by five, as 24 is not.\n6. This means j+n must be equal to 20 or more, depending on whether there are fractions.\n7. From the above information, we can state that the divisor to the answer must be 3n or 5(n/3).\n8. Since Jenny ate more chocolates than Mike, this implies that n is more than 3 (therefore, 20/3 isn't an integer).\n9. So the divisor must be 5(n/5), meaning Jenny must have eaten five times more than Mike.\n10. According to the given contexts, Jenny had eaten 30 chocolate bars, or 5", "answer": " 65"}

The word 'fruits' therefore indicates the plural form of fruit and shouldn't be pluralized with 'harvested'.\n3.

This provides us with the following solution: \"John climbs 10 fewer steps in the last staircase than in the next-to-last staircase,\" and so the steps in the last stairs would be 5.5 feet in total, including both the 0.5 feet of each step and the 5 feet from the steps we subtracted.\n6. Given this information, we can answer: \"John climbs a total of 45.5 feet.\"", "answer": " 45"}

Therefore, we can answer the question by determining how many pages there are without crumplings or with blurs.\nStep1: To answer the final question, the student will calculate with the information given and decide which is the correct answer. The question is not asking for specific percentages, but rather for the final total number of pages without crumplings and with blurs.\n4. To begin, the student will need to know how many crumpled pages there are. In this scenario, they will determine this through subtraction:\n40\u201410 = 30 pages with crumples\n5. To find out how many pages have blurred ink, the student will add the two numbers in the question together to get 42\u201440 = 2 pages with blurred ink.\n\n6. To determine how many pages don't have crumples or blurs, the student will subtract the total amount of crumpling and blurred pages from the total pages.\n7. So, to answer the question how many pages doesn't have crumplings or having blurred, the student will subtract:\n10 + 2 = 12 pages without crumples or with blurred inks\n\n8. There is no requirement to find out exact percentages because it is asked the number of pages to subtract from the number presented at the beginning.

How much tax, in percent, did the IRS require Sarah to pay on her bonus?\nOutput:\n2. The question is asking for the amount of taxes Sarah's employer had to pay to the IRS based on the bonus Sarah earned.\n3. Choices A and B refer to the individual amount Sarah earned and are irrelevant to the nature of the question.\n5.

The given values indicate that Austin started with a total of $17.7 as he purchased seven robots at a cost of $8.75, and paid a total of $7.22 in tax, but left with $11,53 in change.\n3. From this information, it should be possible to calculate Austin's exact amount of change. However, it's not clear what the word 'each' in line 1 refers to, which prevents us from immediately determining the appropriate answer.\n4. In the original sentence, it's not entirely clear whether the word \"each\" is referring to each robot, or to each of the friends who received one.\n5. If the latter were true, then what follows is contradictory, as there would only be 6 friends (as each friend received 7.50$, while Austin paid $7.22 tax).\n6. To determine the correct answer, we must figure out whether or not the word \"each\" refers to Austin himself, or the other friends, and then determine whether it refers to a total of six robots, or seven;\n7. Considering the number of friends given in the question, we can reasonably conclude that it's likely to refer to a total of six robotic toys as 'Austin bought' implies ownership or possession;\n8.

{"text": "The river flowing through Morland on July 13 will have a depth of around 30 feet.\n\nExplanation:Let's say that in mid-May at which a flow of five feet is found.So by mid-june (30thjune), the river will have an increased depth which will then be equal to 10 feet.\nTo calculate this, use the equation 10 = (5 + 5) in order to obtain five as the answer. By mid-January,the river will have another increase and be ten times the depth to five. The calculation for this will be as follows, 30 = (10 + 5).\nTo calculate the depth of the river on 13th june, replace the 5 into the third equation, thus 30 = (5 + (10 + 10)) which is equal to 30+40=70. The next step will then require you to divide this by the number of months in-between them. The number of months will be 2 which then makes the answer as follows,70/2= 35.\nTo find the answer in decimal, the above value needs to be multiplied by.0625 or else we get the answer of 35.16667 for the depth of the river 13thjune.

In the question presented, the word \u201cpresented\u201d used has a negative connotation, indicating that the question is considered improper or unacceptable and that the correct answer is likely to be different from the incorrect answer.\n2. The question asks about a specific situation that has already occurred.\n3. It then asks to identify the age of a specific person within that scenario.\n4. The provided context doesn't explicitly mention any specific date that the scenario took place, making it plausible that the scenario could have happened at any time in the past.\n5. Additionally. The scenario suggests that a certain relationship, such as the relationship between someone's aunt and niece, has already existed for some time, likely meaning that it would still exist in the present day.\n6.

{"text": "Choice: F: $230,000 Explanation: John's total bonus amount: F: $20,000 This is true because:\n1. The question specifies that the bonus amount is \"the same percentage every year.\"\n2. The amount given in the question (as well as the amount that the bonus was in the previous year) is the precise same percentage, which suggests that the bonus amount remains constant.\n3. The percentage amount indicated in the question and given in the answers indicates that the bonus percentage amount is 0.5% (ie. 5 out of 1,000). This suggests John's total bonus each year is $5,000, or 0.5% of his total salary.\n4. Thus, John's bonus this year totalled $20,010 (ie. $200,100 x.005).  Adding his bonus total to his yearly salary equals a total payment of $230,110.\n\nInput:If you borrow money from a bank, you're expected to repay them with interest.  This rate will remain the same for the life of the loan.  For instance, let's say you have a $3,000 loan with a simple interest rate of 3% for 3 years.  During the same period of time, you'll pay $123 in interest.  Why would 123 equal $123?\nOutput:1. The question is asking about the mathematical principles behind simple interest, and why it would produce the same result (ie. $123) for a 1,001 year loan.\n2. Simple interest calculations depend on the original amount borrowed (ie. $3,001), and the interest rate (ie. 3%) being multiplied by the number of years the loan is expected to be outstanding (ie. 3 years).\n3. Additionally, the question implies that the interest rate (and corresponding calculation) are the same throughout the life of the loan (ie. 3%), as opposed to changing each year.\n4. Thus the answer that would be most consistent with the question: 123 = $123\nSo the final answer and correct answer is E: $123", "answer": " 220000"}

The given facts indicate that Joe played catch for twenty-three times with both Derek and Tammy, Joe caught twenty-three balls and Derek made four times fewer catches than that. Finally, Tammy made sixteen times the catches that Derek made.\n9. From this, we can reason that Joe made 23 catches - four less than double his catches.\n10. Additionally, Derek caught 27 balls -12 = six times as many catches.\n11. Lastly, Tammy made 39 catches = 16 * 2 = 3 more times as catches as what Derek made.\n\n12. There are several factors that can complicate the answer - one of which is rounding.\n\n13. We may round the catch totals for some characters and not for others - in a scenario where one character catches 29 balls and the other character catches 27 balls rounded to the nearest integer. Then, we can round this total to 30 balls for one character and 27 balls rounded up to 28 balls for the other character. This makes the given values no longer equal to 30 balls and 27 balls.\n\n14.

{"text": "1) The problem is written in the form of a mixed word problem, meaning that both math operations and words are used to express the solution.\n2) The problem states that from March to August, Sam worked 23 hours a week and earned $460 a week in yard work. This means that Sam earned $10 an hour for his yard work.\n3) Based on this information, the question asks how long it will take Sam to save up $600 for himself, given that he already has $340 in his savings account, working 8 hours every week. To do this, it is first necessary to determine the total number of hours worked between March and August, given that he worked $460.\n4) The number of hours worked can be computed by the equation `hours = rate x time`. In this case,\n5) Using the formula, you can then determine the total number of weeks it took Sam to earn the $460. The equation for this can be written as `takes= 1/rate hrs`.\n6) To do this in more detail, let's take a look at the equation. The formula for `1/rate` is in this case the inverse of `rate`.\n7) The inverse of rate can then be written as `1/rate = rate^-1`. Here is where you will use the formula, `^` to raise numbers to the negative power.\n8) In this case, rate^-1 is equal to the reciprocal of Sam's hourly rate. Since Sam worked for 23 weeks, the `^` symbol should be raised 23 times, and the `rate^-1` in this equation should be the same as his original rate of $10/hr.\n9) In the problem. If Sam worked for the same number of hours per week, the time and cost to do yard work can be computed by the formula below, `= 1/rate weeks`.\n10) Therefore, you just have to substitute the 1/rate with `10^-1`, and you will get `-10` as the number of weeks to complete the formula, and hence the number of hours worked between September and February.\n11) When you want to know how many work weeks it took Sam to save up $340 for himself, you just have to plug in `10^-", "answer": " 16"}

As such, there is always a higher number of layers made up of sandstone than each of the other types.\n5. Therefore, if a layer is made up of some combination of rocks, then we can say that it must be made up entirely of sandstone or some other type of rock.\n6. This means that any given layer is either entirely sandstone, entirely the other types of rock, or a combination.\n7. To confirm this logic, we know that there is a total of 25 different types of rock, so we can deduce that each layer that has any other rock other than sandstone must have multiple other types of rock.\n8. As such, there can't be any layers that have a single type of rock other than sandstone.\n9. Therefore, each layer has at least two different types of rock in it.\n10. As there are a total of 20 layers, that means that there could potentially be 40 types of rock present in any given layer.\n11. However, we know that only the five remaining layers have a single other type of rock, shale in this case.\n12. We also know that four of these layers each have exactly 24/20 = 4/5 = 20/5 of that type of rock.\n13. As a result, this type of rock must be in the remaining five layers.\n14. Therefore, all five layers will have a total of exactly 20/10 of this type of rock.\nSo the final number of layers is 40, making it A: Fourty.", "answer": " 3"}

The question explicitly states that Alani earned $45 in 3 hours for baby-sitting, and that at the same rate, for what amount of time would she need to baby sit to earn $7. The implicit understanding here is that the person refers to the same rate as it was given before.\n3. The formula in order to calculate the number of hours required to earn the desired amount is: earnings=rate*time, where earnings is the total amount earned, rate is the amount per hour and time is the number of hours worked. By substituting the given values, the equation for finding time is: time=75-45/rate.\n4. Using the order of operations principles, it can be assumed that the rate, earnings and time are the variables that should be dealt with before evaluating a final answer. Therefore, it makes more sense to determine the rate as 45/3=15, since the answer is in one decimal, the rounded rate would be used.\n5. The next step is to substitute these values into the formula as time=75-15/15, this simplifies to time=75-2/15, since the divisor (15) here is a whole number that can't be divided any further.\n6. The next step is evaluating the number of hours required based on the amount of time per hour.

The question now is how much time will Tina need to finish her homework. The time she took to do her assignment is 10 minutes.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the number of people carried by the city's bus system for 13 weeks.\n2. The system carries 1.2 million people per day, indicating that it carries a total of 86.4 million people in one month. 3. The question is not directly about this number, and refers instead to the number of people carried over the course of 13 weeks or four months.\n4. The question refers to the number of \"people,\" not \"passengers.\" This makes it much more difficult to arrive at a specific number, and any potential answer could be potentially incorrect if it is based on the number of passengers.\n5. It is reasonable to assume that the bus system has at least some level of consistency over the course of a month, and that it would carry at least some percentage of passengers each week in addition to the total number carried per day.  6. Therefore, assuming the bus system has at minimum a 50% or 0.5 chance of carrying passengers each week, we can arrive at an estimate for the total number of passengers carried over four months. 7. First, we can assume that the bus system would have at least a 30% or 05 chance of carrying passengers (75% x 50% x 13 weeks or 4 months),\n8. This means the bus system carries a total of at least 5 million people for the duration of a four-month period. 9. Additionally, considering the original question refers to the number passengers, passengers could be an appropriate unit for a final answer. 10. However, it is unknown if the bus system's load and capacity factors (number of passengers carried relative to total number of seats available) vary by month, or if they remain consistent enough to estimate the actual total number of passengers carried.\n11. Therefore, in order to arrive at a more accurate estimate of the number of passengers carried, a lower bound of 5 million must be chosen for the question, as it is difficult to account for the possible variation in load and capacity factors over the course of four months without more information from the given data. 12. The lower bound of 500,001 = 5 million + 0 is chosen because there is no information to suggest that the bus system's capacity factors would consistently exceed 500%. 13.

In the second set, the band will play 5 more songs, making a total of 17 songs. This means the average number of songs in the first two sets is 17/2 = 8.5 songs.\n4. For the third set, the band will have 8.5 songs remaining in their repertoire and will play a total of 2 songs for their final encore.\n5. Therefore, averaging the total number of songs the band will play in the first two sets and the number of encore songs, the average number of songs per set for the third and fourth sets becomes the total number of songs played in the first two sets (8.5) + encore songs (2) = 10.5 songs.\n6.

{"text": "The question is about a person named John who takes two pills a day, one of which costs $1.50 and the other costing an unknown amount.\n\n1. The first thing to do is to identify the 2 unknowns: the price of the second pill and the total cost of pills taken each day.\n2. Knowing that the insurance covers 4 out of every 10 pills taken, it can be calculated that John spends 40% of $1.50, or around $0.51 per pill.\n3. The second pill is thus $1.50+$0.51, or $2.01.\n4. Given this information, the final result is as follows: he spends (($1.50+$2.01))*30 days, or $1.50+46.30/30= $1.32+0.153/days.  The cost per day of taking 2 pills is thus $1.32+$0.153= $1.473.\n5.

{"text": "A: 10 m B: 20 m C: 40 m D: 30 m E: 50 m F: 15 m\n\n##### How We Answer:\n7. The provided context indicates a relationship between the two sides of a rectangle, as the area is equal to the product of their product.\n8. Since one side is four times the other, the area is equal to four times the other side squared.\n9. If 'width' is equal to 'length', this means that the area is equal to 100, and thus, 'length' should be four times 'width'.\n10. 'length' can be determined by rearranging the relationship to 'width' to get 'width' from 'length'.\n11. Since 'width = length/4', this means that 'width' is equal 'length' divided by 4.\n12. Therefore, 'length' can be calculated as 'length' = 'width' * 4.\n13. This relationship can then be applied to the area formula.\n14. Since the area is equal to 'width' * 'length', this means 'length' = Area/square (width):\n15. Taking the square root yields:\nlength = [sqrt (area/square (width))] = [sqrt (100/4*4)] = [sqrt (160)] = 15 to 2 decimal places. Which is 15.

{"text": "1. The question is asking about the cost of food for a party.\n2. Given that Susan is planning a party with 30 guests, and she is preparing a recipe that calls for 4 potato and 1 teaspan of salt for each serving, it's clear that she will be making a large quantity of food for the event.\n3. Therefore, we can assume that the cost of food will be significant. \n4. We also know that each container of salt contains 5 teaspoon, and each container of potatoes costs $.10. Given this, we can create a basic formula in which we can calculate how many containers of each item are needed to feed the party. We can write this formula as:\nnumber of containers of potato (x) = 30\nnumber of containers of salt (y) = 4x + 1\n5. We can solve this equation using basic mathematical operations to calculate the number of containers of each item needed to make the recipe. \n6. We can find x (the number of containers of potato required) using the formula: 30 / (4x + 1)\n7. We can then use this value to plug into our formula for y (the number of containers for salt) to determine the number of containers of salt needed.\n8. After putting this information into our equation: y = 4x +1, we can solve for y:  (4x +1) = 30 4x +1 = 30 10x = 30  x = 3  y = 4 (3) + 1 = 6\n9.

A refers to the number of flips that produced tails, while B is the number of flipping sequences out of 211 total.\n3. In this scenario, it's clear Choice A is the best answer as it specifically refers to the number of times tails were recorded, rather than just the total number of flips.\n4. Choice B isn't applicable because the question didn't specify any of the flip sequences, meaning it could be any combination of tails and heads - the question simply refers to the number of tails vs. heads.\n5. Finally, the question only asks for the number of tails that produced tails - it doesn't specify a required relationship between the number of heads and tails, nor is 65 a particularly extreme or noteworthy number.\n6.

{"text": "11. The question starts with 'On a farm,' which implies that we are working with a specific, finite number of cows. Thus, we can assume that the number of cows is limited and cannot exceed the capacity of a large farm.\n2. The question asks how many cows produce 1800 liters of milk in 5 weeks, as opposed to asking how many cows produce the total 1800L of milk across those 5 weeks; this is clarified in line 5, where it states that the total amount of milk produced was 2160L.\n3. To work out how each cow can produce that amount of milk in just 5 weeks it would mean that each cow on average would only need to produce 108L of milk each week.\n4. If we take 1800/108 then we can see that the total amount of cows that can produce this is 16.8. However, we round this up and see that 17 is an integer number, therefore, 17 can be produced.\n5. However, this can't be the case, we can then take 208L, divide by this to see how many cows per week. However, since 108 is the total amount of 16.8 rounded up it gives us 11.002.

This relationship means that for every input value of x, there is one and only one corresponding output value of y. By looking at the given graph, it's clear that the values on the y-axis (0, 1, and 2) are not mapped precisely onto their corresponding values on the x-axis (0.1, 0.2, and 0.21).

{"text": "Maia is a freelancer, which means she works with a small number of clients, and earns income from writing articles for them.\nIn light of this, it's reasonable to assume that Maia likely receives a certain number of client requests (choices B and C) every day, with each of these requests requiring her to write a unique article.\n\nIn order to remain up-to-date on her writing commitments, it makes sense that Maia would attempt to complete at least four client requests each day (choice E).\nHowever, it should be noted that Maia may not be able to complete all requests due to unforeseen circumstances, such as illness or other commitments, which may cause her to miss some deadlines.\n\nAssuming that Maia receives four client requests each day, and works on four of these, after five days it is possible that she may have remaining client requests to complete (choice A).\n\nHowever, it should also be considered that Maia may receive more than four client requests on some days, which could reduce the number of remaining requests (choices B,C).\n\nOverall, while the answer option (A) is the most logical, it is not the exclusive one, as it possible that she may work on a fewer requests than required and have some remaining.

Answer the question.\nOutput 1: The question requires that we answer the question mathematically, so the best answer would be the choice that most directly addresses the question mathematically - which is Choice A.\nOutput 2: Choice A is the correct answer, because there are multiple methods to calculate the number.\nOutput 3: A person being the total of the number people they've touched or been in the room as could refer to either choice B, or choice E. Neither is correct mathematically as there is not a mathematical expression that defines 'total' in the general sense. However, we can express it in terms of choice B, but not choice E. It does not make sense for a person to not count the number of people they've touched on some days, but to count the number of people in the same room as those that count on others. Therefore, the correct answer would be Choice B.", "answer": " 10"}

Therefore, you need to identify another number to eliminate the two quantities mentioned in the question.\n6) The rule states that you start with 3 apples and give a quantity equal to one apple (2) over to your wife.\n7) You then divide the remaining fruits by the same equation.\n8) This means that you can eliminate the quantity of 3 apples as that was the initial amount.\n9) Therefore, the quantity of 2 apples, along with the 1 apples given to your wife, means that you can state that you started with 4 apples.", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "Ansaer: 0.8 ml Question:\n1. The question is focused on collecting as much salt as possible from the water, by evaporating it, and Jack wants to be able to season his fish with it, as the amount of salt he has is likely a limited resource that he will depend on for his survival on the island.\n2. Jack has collected 2 liters of water, but its salt content isn't specified, and the answer would be invalid if the water is instead completely salt-free.\n3. The question mentions that the water will completely evaporate when the temperature on the island rises in the summer.\n4. Since the volume of water will completely disappear, the question focuses on the proportion of salt that will remain.\n5. It is assumed that the water has been collected in a container rather than a pot, which is most likely.\n6. The question states that 'if the water is 2/ of salt', meaning that 20% of the water is salt.\n7. The water has a volume of 2 liters, so the 20% salt content represents 0.4 liters of salt.\n8. There are 1,000 ml in one liter.\n9. Therefore 400 ml is present in 0.4 litres.\n10. We see that 2 liters of 20% salt equals 400 mL of salt.\n11. When all the water evaporated, all of the salt would be present.\n12. If the volume of the bucket is unspecified, it will be assumed to be one quarter of a liter.\n13. Since Jack only has 0.4 litre of salt, 2 liters of air will take up 0.5 litre of the bucket.\n14. Since the remainder of the container is half full, there will be 0.25 litre of space left.\n15. 0.5 litres of air will occupy 0.75 litres of space.\n16. Therefore the answer is 0.8 litres of salt.\n17. The salt content is the same as the water content, and therefore, there is no more salt left.\n18.", "answer": " 400"}
{"text": "1: The question asks about how many pizza pieces remain after Bill and Dale have eaten 50% and Ann and Cate have eaten 75% of their pizzes.\n2: Let's look at the data first. The proportion of each person's pizza they have eaten is given as 50% for Bill and Dale, and 75% for Ann and Cate.\n3: The question then asks how many pizzas are left uneaten. To solve this, we can subtract the sum of the percentages each person left from 100% (100% being the total amount of pizza), which will give us the unconsumed amount remaining.\n4: To do this, we can multiply the total amount of pizzas by the amount each person left, then subtract that amount from the total.\n5: The total amount of pizzes is 8 and the total amount of each pizzas left is 6. And 50% for both Bill and Dale, 75% for both Ann and Cate. If the summation of these is 8, then the result will be 6. Subtract the 100% from the 8 and the result will be 48.\n6: Now that the answer is known (48), divide it by the total sum (8) to get 6.\n7: That's it!

{"text": "1. The question is asking for a mathematical computation to determine the final amount of bananas each monkey in a family receives when they divide a common pool of bananas evenly among themselves.\n2. There are two parts to the problem statement - first, identifying and counting the monkeys and bananas, and second, distributing the bananas evenly.\n3. First, a total of 12 monkey families will each include 12 monkeys, with each monkey taking 9 bananas or each family taking 14 bananas (from 6 groups of 9).\n4. Since there are no additional bananas, each family will each receive the same amount of bananas (14 bananas each from the 6 groups of 14 bananas)\n5. Therefore, each family will have 12 monkeys that take 14 bananas.\n6. Each family will divide their bananas equally between 12 monkeys (the number in one monkey family).\n7. The bananas will be divided evenly since each monkey family has 14 bananas to share between 12 monkey members.\n8. The bananas would be divided as: 14 bananas for a family with 12 monkeys.\n9. Therefore, each monkey family would receive 9 bananas, and each monkey within each family would receive one banana.\n\nSo the final answer would be 9 bananas would each monkeys get.\n\nInput:A woman has 8 cats.

The number of cats that play tennis is at least \"3/4 of the cats.\" With 252 female cats and 128 male cats, between 252/4 or 63 cats are female (which isn't enough and is probably equal to 128).\n\nSo to", "answer": " 99"}

This is the same as practicing for 2 hours a day  for 3 days a week. If she practices the same time each day, her monthly practice time is 6 hours times 4 weeks and so this is equal to 24 hours. If she practices the piano for 1/4 of this time, it is 6 hours, and so we multiply by 1/4 and get 1.5 hours per week. We multiply this by 4 weeks.\n3.

The first step in solving this problem is recognizing that the first number of the fraction is divided by the second number.\n3. The next step is solving the division. In this case, this means that 10 is divided by 12. \n4. This can be simplified by using the distributive property. This means that 10 can be divided evenly by 1.\n5. As 10 can be expressed as 10/1, the divisor needs to be divided into 1, resulting in 12 divided by 1.\n6. This can be simplified, as 12/1 can be written as 12.\n7.

A person who buys multiple ounces of sodas may do so because they need more than one ounce of soda to quench their thirst or because they want to buy a quantity of sodas at a discounted price per unit, but either way they would likely not spend the full $2 per ounce, since their total purchase is only $1, and their total purchase amount is smaller than the total spend amount (they have about $.50 left).\n5.

{"text": "1. The question asks for the number of minutes Rosie should run on Friday to achieve 20 miles in total for the week.\n2. The information in the question provides details about Rosie's planned running schedule for the week, which is helpful in determining the final answer.\n3. The first step is to add up the total amount of time she has already run, which can be done by summing up the 6 miles per hour per day (6 x 24 = 144 miles per week), with the 20 additional minutes that were accumulated from her short runs on other days (60 Minutes). This gives us a total of 144 + 60 minutes, or 204 minutes per week.\n4. Since Rosie's goal is to run 20 additional miles to reach 204 for the week, this means the total amount of time it'll take her to run 224 miles is 224/6 = 37.33 hours.\n5. To convert this to minutes, we can simply multiply by 60 (37.33 x 60 = 2289)\n6. Therefore, 2289 minutes is the final answer.\n\nSo the final answeris 2289", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "1) The question refers to the exercise machine using technology to make the weights feel 20% heavi-  ered on the lowering portion of the exercise.  Since the lowering portion refers to both before and after the weights become heavier, this statement must apply even AFTER the weights are made lighter.\n2) It is noted that the user has 10 additional plates weighing 360 pounds which make them 20% heav-  ier on the lowering side.  So when the 30 pound weights become lighter on the upper portion, they will actually be 40 pounds on the lower portion, which is only 20% heavIer compared to the 360 pound plates.\n3) Therefore, on the lower portion of the exercise, the weights will feel 40 pounds since the plates are made 20% heav~er on the lowering portion by 10 additional plats and the 30 pouncl weights are then made 40 % heavier by the technology used on the equipment.

For example, Uki is selling cupcakes at $ 1.50, therefore, her daily income will be $1.5*20 = $30.\n7) The total income from each item will then be subtracted from 5 to get a daily amount of sales for each item instead of an average daily number.\n8) The remaining daily amount of sales for the items will be multiplied by their respective prices to get the income.

If there are 16 apples & 21 bananas & 13 pears in the box, what fraction of the pears are apples?\nOutput:There are 16 appes, 21 bananas and 13 pears, so the ratio between apples and bananas=3:5. This is because 21/5=16/3. We don\u2019t know the denominator, but we can find the denominator using our knowledge. Since there are twice as many bananas as pears, then the sum of the numbers in the fraction will be twice as much as it should be. Hence there are 33 apples in a box.

The primary focus of the query is on the quantity of caffeine consumed, but the context contains a discrepancy between measurements, making an accurate calculation challenging.\n\n7. Given the context, the caffeine content of the energy drinks is important. 12 ounces is equal to 0.250 kg, which is used to determine the initial amount of caffeine taken.  However, the second drink is 3x more caffeinated, which implies it is 0.025kg in weight.  To take this into account, we will use the unit rate of milligrams per gram to determine the amount of caffeines consumed.\n7. To convert the 0.25 kg of caffeine into milligrams, we divide by 1000, resulting in 250,000 milligrams of caffeines.  Given the 2 drinks combined contain 250,491 milligrams compared to the supplement that contains 250,598 milligrams, we see that the second drink is slightly more caffeinated than the combination of the 2 drinks.  This is due to the weight of the supplement being slightly below that of the energy drink, resulting in a slightly lower milligram content in its caffeine when given as a whole.\n\nSo the final answer the second drink is 800 milligrams more caffeinated for each.", "answer": " 750"}

{"text": "The task required is to determine the total number of pages Mack writes. As the answer will need to consider the duration of each section and the number of pages he writes during that time frame, you must first determine each of these values.\n\nSolution\n\n1. To calculate the total amount of pages Mack writes, you must determine the number of pages he wrote daily from Monday to Wednesdays.\n\n2. To do this, you need to know the total amount of pages he wrote, the duration of the section, and the number of pages written during that duration of time.\n\n3. You start by calculating the duration and rate per hour of writing and then adding them all together to find the total duration. In order to do this, we use a simple formula: Duration of writing per hour = (Pages written / Duration of writing)\n\n4. From Monday to Wednesday, Mack wrote 60 pages over a period of 90 minutes and then 1 page every 20 minutes and finally wrote 5 pages in his notebook over the course of 45 minutes.\n\n5. By using the provided information from Monday to Wednesady, we can calculate the total number of pages written as follows: Total number of pages written = Duration of all pages written in hours * Rate of writing\n\n6. To find the duration of each section, you must first determine the number of pages in Mack's notebook that he wrote on a daily basis, which is determined by dividing the total number of pages in his notebook by the total number of days he completed the journal.\n\n7. As you can see from the table here, Mack wrote on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the total number of written pages was 130. Therefore, as you can see from the first table here, the length of his writings on a daily basis.\n\n8. To calculate the total number of hours Mack spent writing in his notebook, you must multiply the time he spent writing with the number of written pages. Mack wrote for a total of four hours over the three days.\n\n9. To find the total number of pages, you need to multiply the total number of pages with the total number of hours. Given the information you received from Mack's journal, here it is:\n\n10. Therefore, you can determine the total number of written-in pages over the three days as follows", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "1. The question is about distributing a set of desserts amongst a family of seven people.\n2. They each get one cookie to divide, which means that each person gets four cookies. This is a reasonable solution.\n3. Therefore, the simplest way to distribute the set of 42 cookies is for everyone to receive four each.\n4. Similarly, the 63 pieces of candies get distributed equally to each person, meaning they would receive.7*63/63.\n5. Finally, the 21 brownies are divided evenly among all 7 people so that each person gets 21/7 of a brownie.\n6. It is thus possible to divide the entire set of desserts using this formula:\n42/7 + 63/7 + (21/7)/7 = 4 + 63/4 + (21/9)/9 = 4 + 27/4 + 2.225 = 29.225/9 = 3.2 or 42/7, 63/7, 21/7\n7.

The data implies that each hat has multiple stripes, and that the total number of stripe is greater than 1.\n3. The data does not explicitly state the exact number of stripes on any given hat or the total number of hats.\n4. Therefore, the best way to approach this question would be to write out all the possible combinations and add them together to calculate the total number of strips.\n5. There are four 3-striped hats, each containing 3 stripes, with a total of 12 stripes, or 24 stripes for the first combination.\n6. In addition, there are 6 hats with no stripe and 2 hats with 5 stars each. This means for the second combination, which would be 3 hats x 0 stripes = 4 hats have 4/0 = 4 total stripes.\n7.

Let's start by expressing the person's total daily calorie burn as follows: 800 cal/d + 16(60min/d) + 280(1hr/d) = 8240 cal/d\n2: However, this answer does not specify the number of days per week the person is attempting to burn the total amount of calories. Therefore, in order to determine how much they burn over the week, you would have to divide the total amount of calorie burn by 7. This is because you would perform 7 similar calculations to represent the amount of calorie burn for each of the 7 days in the week\n\nInput:Why was the student punished?

We can use the 'for a normal 30-day month' statement in the passage to infer that the amount of visitors per month is approximately 30,000.\n3. From this knowledge, we can multiply the statement 'Per month he get $.01 per visit.' by the 30,040 (number of visits = 30,039) to arrive at the amount of money earned per month.\n4. The total amount earned in a month can then be calculated by multiplying the amount earned per month by 30 days (the number of days in a month).\n5. Therefore, the amount earned in a month will be: $30,045.\n6. So answer is: $30,440 per month.\n\nInput:What is the value of X?\nOutput:1: We must first identify what the letter 'X' represents in the question.\n2: We can infer from the context of the question that the letter X represents the total amount of money or units being traded in the trades.\n3: We may also conclude from the context of the trades that there was potentially an incentive for trading a certain amount of the unit or currency, with an unknown commission rate (in this case, $1).\n4: Once we have the two parameters ($1, the incentive per unit traded) known, we can solve for the value of 'X' by: $X = 1 * 20 = $20, which is the correct answer.\nSo the final solution is $20, which can be simplified to $10.", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "1. The word \"list\" in the prompt strongly suggests a numerical representation of tasks to be completed.\n2. A to-do list usually includes separate tasks to be completed and assigned time estimates.\n3. The first to-do items in the prompt are \"make a To Do list\" and \"count up how many things I have to do\".\n4. The tasks \"clean the house\" and \"take a shower\" don't have a given duration, so we can deduce that they aren't part of the next To Do list.\n5. From task 3 on, there are 7 tasks of \"clean the house\", 1 task of \"take a shower\", and 4 tasks of \"make [different] dinners\".\n6. The list starts with cleaning the house, which presumably has some duration.\n7. The next tasks are \"take a shower\". Based on the previous context, we can deduce that taking a shower means bathing and taking a bath, so the duration should be 10 minutes.\n8. We can deduce that the tasks \"make dinner\" don't have an exact duration, so we can assume the context in which there is only a set number of dinners, not a number of portions of the same menu item.\n9. From the previous steps, we know that Trey should have 7 cleaning tasks, 1 bathing task, and 4 cooking tasks.\n10. Because the duration for cooking and cleaning isn't specified, we can deduce it to be 10 minutes, because in everyday English, the word \"a diner\" refers to a meal, rather than a set of specific dishes served individually, and 10 minutes should be reasonable amount of time to prepare a single dinner.\n11.

When one ball is drawn, the probability of drawing a red ball is 0.5 (two red balls in six balls chosen), and it is 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 for drawing a white ball.\n \n In this case, the probability is 0.5 x 2 / 2 + 0.5 x x / 4 and simplifies to 0.1 x 2 / 7 + 0.1 x x / 7 = 0.1 x (2 + x) / 7, so that the probability of getting a black ball (x) when choosing one ball from the three balls becomes C: 0.1 x + 0 = 0.1.\n \n In the case of the bag, the probability of picking white or red ball becomes P = 0.5/6 = 0.083333.

To calculate the total value, we must add the value of the 'twice' units to the value of the 'half' unit (i.e., twice 1 = 2, half 1 = \u00bd \u00d7 2 = 1).\n10. We also know the sum of the throws must be 1050 since this is explicitly stated in the question.\n11. Subtracting 4 \u00d7 2 from 1050 gives us 940. We see that this is a possible sum for each combination of units.\n12. However, if we subtract 2\u00d7 2 from 1 \u00d7 4 + 4 \u00d7 \u00bd, the result is 0. Therefore, each of these combinations can be ruled out.\n13. We are left with two possible combinations, 1 \u00d7 4 and 2 \u00d7 2.\n14. Comparing the values above, 1 \u00d7 2 is twice 1 (from adding the 'twice' unit), and the 'half' unit is \u00bd \u00d7 2, so the total value above is 4.\n15. 1 \u00d7 4 is 4, and we know we subtracted 4 \u00d7 2 to get 940, so the sum", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "1. The problem statement indicates Tony wants to build the longest possible rope using the ropes he found in his home, so his intention is to add them all together and tie them into a single rope.\n2. The problem asks for the length of the rope, so it is not about counting the number of times the length is tied together (Choice A) or the number of ropes (Choice C).\n3. The problem also mentions that each knot decreases the length of the ropes by a fixed amount (Choice B), which indicates that Tony is tying the ropes together in a specific manner.\n4. The final question asks for the length of Tony's rope, meaning he has successfully tied the ropes.\n5. Therefore, the answer choices indicate Tony tying the ropes in such a way that one rope is repeatedly overlapped and lashed between the remainder of multiple separate ropes.\n6. The problem then states that 1.2 feet is the amount of length lost with each knot (Choice D), meaning when multiple knots are made, this additional foot-reduction factor would multiply.\n7. This indicates that every time Tony made a knot, he was reducing the rope's total length by 1 + 1.2.\n8. Thereafter, Tony added and tied the ropes together, so he would lose another foot every time he made a knot.\n9. Therefore, each time Tony tied a knot, he would reduce the rope's length by a total of 2.2 feet.\n10. If he tied the same length rope (20 feet) 2.2 times (20/2.2 = 9), it would reduce the length to almost 9 feet.\n11. If he tied it 2.2 times, it reduced the length to 10.5 feet.\n12. If he tied it another 2.2 times it reduced it to 12.7 feet.\n13. Therefore, the final length of the rope can be worked out by multiplying 20 by 9.\n14. This gives 180 feet.\n15. Since the rope was meant to be as long as possible, this gives the final answer, 180 feet (Choice E).\nSo the final answer should be E.Eighteen", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "1. The question asks about Paul's distance traveled on his treadmill, and it provides an input of how long his movies are.\n2. The output is two options: 12 miles, and 6 miles. Based on the context, this answer is correct. The correct answer is 6 miles.\n3. The math involved is relatively simple. Paul runs a total of 12 miles, since each movie was 1.5 hours long.\n4. Additionally, if Paul was watching longer movies, such as 2-hour-long films, he would cover more distance, as this extra time would count toward his total.\n5. However, for this scenario, the movies are an 'average length of 2' hours. This means that Paul is able to run for the same amount of time as the duration of the movies. However, movies can vary in duration, such as 2.5 - 3 hour movies, which would mean Paul would run a different distance.\n6. The answer can be found by multiplying the number of minutes Paul watches the film(s) by 12 minutes per mile. This is easy to do since Paul runs 12 miles, so the equation is 2 x 12. This equals 24 minutes, or 2/3rds of a mile.\n7. Therefore 24 minutes divided by 12 minutes means 2 miles. The last step is to add this 2-mile quantity to the number of miles Paul already ran, meaning 12 + 2 = 14 miles, thus the most reasonable answer is 14 miles.\n8.

{"text": "1: The question refers to a hypothetical business owner, James, who creates a media empire, but the context is unclear.\n2: It is impossible to determine the answer directly from the information provided, as it does not specify how James created his empire. However, it appears that he is using DVD production as a cost estimate to create his media empire.\n3: According to the context, the movie costs $6 to make and is sold for $15. Therefore, the answer would be that James sells each DVD 2.5 times what it cost to make him, to make a profit of 2.5x15=37.5\n4: It is unclear how much each DVD costs to create, but given the context, it does not appear to exceed the $6 cost stated in the question, nor does it exceed the $2000 budget stated earlier in the question.\n5: James' total profit over 20 weeks = 37.5*20 = 750\nSo the final answer for this answer should be 750.

{"text": "1.) Anna gets 40 more pieces of candy than Billy.\n\nFirst step: 1. The provided context indicates Anna and her brother Billy trick-or-treated in different subdivisions, where Anna received more candy than Billy. It's important to note that Choice B is incorrect, as Billy likely lives in the same subdivision as Anna.\n\nSecond step: 2. The two subdivisions were both referenced as having 75 houses. Thus, the combined number of houses is 145.\n\nThird step: 3. Knowing the combined number of houses, it's important to determine how many pieces of candy are available in the combined subdivisions.\n\nFourth step: 4. The total number of available candies in the combined subdivision is 75 * 145 = 11,125.\n\nFifth step: 5. To determine the amount of candy Anna receives, we need to compare the combined amount of 11,195 available candies to the total number of houses - which was 145 in the provided context.\n\nFinal step: 6. By dividing the total candy available by the total number of houses, we can see that Anna is given 76.5 pieces of candy for each house, while her brother Billy is given 71.5 pieces of cake.\n7.

{"text": "1. The question posed relates to the notion of a exponential increase in the number of collapses after each subsequent earthquake event.\n\n2. The given input indicates that four buildings collapsed after the first earthquake.\n3. If this trend holds true, it would mean that each subsequent earthquake should result in double the number of collapsed buildings.\n4. Therefore, the total number of buildings that collapsed after three additional earthquakes would be 4+4x2+4x2x2= 32 or 32.\n\n5. Similarly, the number of buildings that collapses would be increased exponentially with each earthquake, and the answer would still increase even without an additional earthquake. This implies that the total number of buildings collapsing would eventually become unlimited (infinite), as the number of collapsings increases exponentially with each earth quake, and would therefore be greater than any other number.\n\n6. It should be noted that the above answer assumes that the collapse count follows a geometric progression and not a geometric progression since this would not end even if there were no additional earthquake events.\n\n7. If the collapse count followed a geometric progression, the answer would be much less than the infinite number calculated before.\n8. For each earthquake, the buildings would lose a small amount of stability, which could result in the buildings being damaged but not necessarily collapse.\n9. The answer is 32.", "answer": " 60"}

This leaves 173 sentences that were typed today, which we can subtract from the 131 sentences completed yesterday to determine the number of sentences that started with today.\n7. The answer is 151 sentences.\nSo the final Answer:\nFinal answer is: 151 sentences\n\nInput:There are ten times as many minutes in six hours as there are in one minute. The ratio between these two quantities is therefore 10. This means that ten times as many minutes fit into six hours as they do into one. Therefore, the answer to the question is True.\n\nOutput: 1 The question presents a scenario in which one is given a ratio of 10, implying that there are ten times as many minutest in six hours as there in one minute.\n2 The question then states that the proportion in question is true, indicating that the math is correct.\n3 The question does not contain any details or variables beyond the two quantities and the ratio.\n4 The response thus comes down to whether one is confident that 10 times as many minutes fit in six hours as there do in one.\n5 This is a straightforward question with a straightforward answer.\n6 Therefore, the answer is True.\nSo the final answe: True\n\n\nInput:Four is divisible by three.

The question is asking about the relationship between time spent working and compensation received, where a particular amount of time spent working is equivalent to a certain amount of compensation.\n2. The question describes work being worth $8$ hours worth or $200$, so let's denote this as $P_{8}$.\n3. Similarly, we can denote $16$ hours as $P_{16}$, and $200$ hours as $P_0$.\n4. To determine the solution, we must understand the relationship between $P_i$ and $X_i$, where $X_i$ is the additional compensation for working $i$ hours.\n5. We can note that $X_0 = 200$, as $P_0$ indicates it's equivalent to $200$, while $X_8 = 800$, as $8$ hours worth worked is equivalent to $800$.\n6. So, we know that $X_0$ and $X_8$ are the solutions, but we need to determine which one is greater.\n7. One way to determine this is by comparing the values of $X_8$ and $P_16$.\n8. $700\\(x\\)$$2$ is greater than $800$, which means $X_8 > P_{16}\\), so $X_{16}$ is greater than $200$,  as it's equivalent to the additional compensation for $16$ hours of work", "answer": " 500"}

{"text": "1) The problem statement indicates that Frank has a certain amount of money in the form of bills and change, and must purchase peanuts at a certain price per pound.\n2) To answer the question of how many pounds he eats on average per day, the calculation would depend on the total amount of money he has available, the price per pound of the peanuts, and the total number of pounds he plans to eat in one week.\n3) The provided context states that Frank has $4 in change, which he plans to use to purchase peanuts. This information can be used to calculate how many pounds he can buy per day.\n4) The math question asks about the average number of pounds eaten per day. So, the calculation to solve would be to find the total number of pounds eaten in one week divided by the total number of days in the same week.\n5) The solution would be the total pounds eaten divided by the total number days eaten to find the average number of pounds per day.\n6) Using the information that Frank has $4, which is the total amount of change he has, allows us to calculate what 3 pounds of peanuts cost.\n7) Since 3 pounds of peans cost 3 x 3 = 9, we can find that 9 x 7 = 63, and deduce that 63 is the total number of days he eats peanuts in one week.\n8) Subtracting 1 for the day he does not eat, the leftover day is 62, which when divided by 63 gives us 1.\n9) Then, multiplying this by 4, he must eat 4 pounds of peanuts per day if he wants to eat all of the peanuts in one day.\n10) Because the question asks for his average daily intake, we need to determine the remaining days from the 1 left over.\n11) 62-1 = 61 days in which he eats an average of 4 pounds of peans per day is: 4 x 61 = 244\n12) Therefore: The answer is 244 pounds.\n\n### Answer: E", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "1: The problem statement specifies that Tommy is using 4 pounds of flower per loaf, rather than using exactly 1 pound.\n2. The problem statement also states that Tommy is throwing away the remaining flour after he is finished making his bread.\n3. So the flour bought will be either that which was needed to complete each loaf, OR the excess which would be discarded regardless of what amount was spent on flour as a whole.\n4. Therefore, the total amount spent on flour will be: (4 * Pounds of flour Required) + [(4-10 Pounds of flour left over) * Price of flour].\n5. Therefore, the math problem will look like: (4 x 12) Pounds + 0(Price of any leftover amount * Pounds)\n6. Solving the equation will become: Pounds = Total flour purchased.\n7. So the answer to the Math Problem is: 1.760 Pounds, or 176 pounds.[6 choices]\nSo the final answer of the math problem is 176 pounds.\n\nInput:Danny has 20 marbles and Rae has 15 marbles.

The remaining 100 people then have the food for 60 more days before every food is gone.\"\n\nCombining these two statements, it is clear that the remaining 100 \"people\" have been provided with enough food to sustain them for a total of days. \n\nThus, the answer is 90 + 60 = 150 days.\n\n#### Solution 2\n\nThe answer provided is incorrect because it fails to account for the number of \"people\" who were initially in the castle. \n\nTo correctly solve the problem, one must first determine the original number of people in the castle (i.e. the population before 80 people left).\n\nUsing the information provided in the problem statement, it can be deduced that the initial population was 302 people. \n\nThen, if the food supply is enough to sustain 300 people, each person in the initial population would have enough food to meet their own needs for ninety days. \n\n\n\nBut to determine how many days are left for the original 302, we have to account for two separate groups of people - the initial group and the subsequent group of 100.\n\nFirst, we must subtract the number of 'people' who left the castle after day 30 - leaving a total of 202 people - which will continue to be nourished by the same amount of food for 60 days. \n\nThe next group of 102 people will then require food \"for days\", as it will last them just shy of the remaining 60 days.\n\nThis leaves a total of 140 \"people\" needing food - which would be just enough to meet their needs for an additional 90 days. \nThen multiply by 100 to find the \"number of", "answer": " 90"}

When all the 398 passengers are added together the sum equals 13,012 which shows the odds of all surviving.\n\nOutput: This question is about calculating the odds of a plane crash.\n1. The answer is the probability of the event multiplied by 100.\n2. In the event of a plane crash, the probability that one passenger will be injured is 1/100.\n3. The answer is the amount of survivors in a plane crash divided by the amount of passengers on board.\n4. The odds of a survivor's survival in a plane crash is 60% or 60/110. The odds of someone surviving is 100% minus the probability of that event, which is the probability of someone dying in a plane crash.\n5. The odds of 286 people dying in a plane crash is the probability of one person dying multiplied by the number of people in a plane.

From the provided problem description, we can observe that the function 'TotalWidgetsInTime' has the inputs time, Jack, Sam, and Tony.\n4. Additionally, we can infer that the output of this function is the total number of widget assembled in a given period of time.\n5. Furthermore, Jack, Sam, or Tony are only active in this function when they aren't 'busy' and are available to assist in the assembly of widgets in a given time frame.\n6. In terms of the input variables, 'time' is the input value representing how long each worker can be expected to participate in widget assembly.\n7. 'Jack' is the name of one of the active workers who can help in the assembly process during the time frame, while 'Sam' and 'Tony' represent other active workers who also aid in the process.\n8. It's worth noting that, in the language of computational science, the function 'TotalWidgetInTime' is a function defined over three inputs and yields a single output value. \n\nTo sum up, the function 'TotalWigettsInTime' represents the process of assembling widgets over a span of time, with varying levels of assistance from Jack, Sam, and  Tony.\n\n### Instruction :  Choose the appropriate synonym for the word in question below.\n\nInput:Circulatory A: blood B: heartbeat(EKG) C: blood vessels D: blood pressure E: blood clots F: vein G: artery H: aneurysm\nOutput:1.

(Choices A and E) - In 3 years, Eustace will be 39 years old. (Choice F) - Milford is 19 years old right now. (Choices A, B, and D)\n3. Based on this information, the answer could be: - Choice A: Milford will be 20 years old in 3 years. - Choice B: Milford will be old in 3 years after 25 years. - Choice D: Milford will be young in 3 years.\n4. To figure out how old Eustace will be in 3 years, you first need to determine how old he is right now. - Milford is twice as young as Eustace (Choice A), so that means Milford will be 1/2 of his age right now. - Since Eustace is 39 years old in 3 more years, that means he is 39 - 3 = 36 right now.\n5. Therefore, Milford will be 55 years old in 32 years. - Eustace is 2x as young right now as Milford, - Milford is 32 in 3 years, - Choice A: Eustace will be older in 3 years after X years (55-19 = 36), - If we put this together: 19 + X + 3 = 55\n6.

The sentence \"Aaron... was\" does refer to an action and a noun i.e.:\"action\" and \"noun\", but that information could easily refer to various possible events without any more specific information.\n\n3.

To answer this question, it is necessary to determine what speed is required to make it to work on Marcos' boat. This can be done by multiplying the distance traveled by the time taken to travel across the lake and overcoming any other obstacles. The speed required must be equal to the total distance over the total time it takes, expressed in units of miles per hour. \n2. Let d represent the distance traveled, t represent the time taken and v represent the required speed in miles per hour. Then, we can use the following equation:\na. d = (5 mi/1 mi) x (10 min/60 secs)\nb. d = 500/60 x 10  =  8 \nc. v = d/t \nd. v = 500 sec/t  =  8 mph \nSo the speed is 8 mph.  \n\n\nInput: The distance from San Jose to the Golden Gate Bridge is 8 miles.

His brother Peter has 3 years on him, meaning that Peter is at least 39 and possibly older. Peter is 3 years on him means it can be said that they\u2019re born in same year.\n3. Since Wayne was born in 1984 and Peter in 1987, it can be concluded that Julia was likely born in 1961 or 1962.\n4. Wayne was born between 1981 and 1986.\n5.

{"text": "1. The question requires you to calculate the age difference between Lavinia's son (LS) and Lavinia's daughter (LD), based on two given pieces of information: the age of LD and the age of KD (KD = Katie's daughter).\n2. You can use the difference in their ages to determine the difference between the ages of LS and LD. Remember, if LD is 12 years, then LS must be at least two times this number (twice twelve).\n3. To calculate the difference, you can subtract LD from LS and then divide it by two: (LS - LD)/2.\n4. Assuming that LD = 12, LS = (LS + 12)/2 = 25. If you divide 25 by 2, you'll get a result of 12.5.\n5. Now, you know that LS is at least twice this age, so the difference between LS and LD must be at least 25 - 12.5 = 12.\n6. Thus, LS is at least 9-12 years older than LD. Therefore, the son, Lavinia, is at least 9 years older than his daughter. But he's more likely to be older by more than 9 years, as 12.5 is actually closer to 25 than 9\n6. The best answer is 'at least 9 years older'\n7. Therefore,  A: at least 9 years old B: at least 18 months old C: at least 6 years old D: at least two years younger E: at least 9 \u00bd years old\n8.

{"text": "1) The question refers to alligators walking from their homes at the River Nile, to the Nile Delt. This implies that they would need to travel past 'the Delta' to reach their homes.\n2) The question asks for combined time that the alligators walked, not for each individual alligator's travel time.\n3) We can use the equation: Combined time = (Time one + time two). Where, the 'one' and 'two' represent the time taken by different travelers to complete their respective journeys.\n4) We know that Paul took 4 hours to travel from home to the Nile Dellas, and that each of the other six alligators took an additional 2 hours to travel back.\n5) Combined time taken by alligators = ((4 + 2) - 1) hours = (4 + 2) hours = 6 hours.\n6) Therefore, the combined time taken by alligator travelling from the homes at River Nile, to Nile Delta and back is 6 hours.\nSo the final answers is 6: hours.\n\nInput:In a two-story building, the elevator takes 3 times longer to go from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor than to return, and 2 times longer to go from 2nd floor to 1st floor than to return.

{"text": "1. The initial step in this problem is making observations about the information provided.\n2. We can see that Ashley invited 20 friends, who each brought one more friend, totaling 21 people.\n3. However, it's not clear if the guests brought friends in addition to Ashley or the number of guests at the party was 21 all along.\n4. To better understand the total number of guests at the birthday party, it's important to consider the following variables.\n5. 'Half the number of invited guests each brought one more person,' means we have the total number of guests, and the number of guests who were at the party.\n6. So, half the invited guests brought one more person. If this is the case, we can infer that the number of guests at a party is half the number of invited guests.\n7. Furthermore, since every person brought one more person, it can be concluded that three friends may arrive to each guest.\n8. Therefore, the total number of guests plus Ashley is equal to 13 guests plus 3 guests, which is equal to 16 guests in total.\n9. Therefore, the answer to the question is 16 guests in totality.\nSo the final solution is 16 guests", "answer": " 31"}

You take it on the Tuesday, the Wednesday, the Thursday, and the Friday. Your friends who didn\u2019t cheat see you on the Monday, the Tuesday, and every other day.\n\nOutput: \n1. Let X = the number of days missed\nAssignment: Let the value x = 1, so on the Monday, and then x-1 on every other day\n2. If they saw you after x-1 days, then you missed the test for a total of x days\n3. There were a total of three days where you didn\u2019t miss a test\n4. This means that you skipped x-3 days\n5. This means that if you missed the test on a day where you didn\u2019t see a friend, then you must have missed at least x-3 days\n6. As a result x \u2267 4, so x \u2265 4\n7. So on the Monday, you missed a test\n8. On the Tuesday, you saw everyone one the Monday, so you must have taken the test\n9. On the Wednesday, you saw everyone on the Tuesday and the Monday, so you might have missed the test\n10. So the whole thing works out to:\nYou took the test on the Tuesday\nYou might have missed the test on the Wednesday\nYou didn\u2019t miss the test on the Thursday or the Friday\nSo the answer is: You took the test on the wednesday.", "answer": " 28"}

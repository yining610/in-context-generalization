For example, 30 is divisible by 2 (30/2=30/2) and, since 30/30=1/30, it is not prime: 30 / 30 = 1, therefore 30 is evenly divisible by a number smaller than 30. However, 19 is not divisible by a number other than 1 or 19 itself: 19 / 19 = 1 / 19 =.05263, so 19 is said to be prime.\n\nD: A fraction is a number that can be written in the form of a / b, where a and b are two integers (numbers).\n\nE: A rational number is a number that is capable of being written in the form of one integer divided by another; for example, 13 / 7.\n\nF: A rational number with an undefined fractional component is called \"irrational\" if its denominator is a non-repunit prime, where \"repunit\" means \"repetitive\", since there is no repeating pattern in the prime number that makes up the numerator:\n\nExample:\n4 / 3 = 1, 8 / 3 = 2, 13 / (2 x 3) = 1. (repunit prime)\n\nHowever, 2 is rational, since 2 / 2 = 1. Therefore, irrational numbers are all non-repunit primes.\n\nG: The denominator of a fraction cannot be \"evenly divided\" by that fraction\u2014that is, if some integer value divided by that fraction gives a remainder of 0, the fraction is irrational.\n\nH: As mentioned under \"c\",", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "In order to solve this question, you must first determine the height of the sunflowers from packet A. In order to do this, we know that the height of packet A is 20% tougher than packet B. To determine the height of packet B, we can use subtraction to subtract 20% of the height of packet A. This will give us a value that represents the height of package B after the seeds of package A have been planted. Once the height of packet A and B have been determined, we can use the concept of percentages (which means that one hundred percent of something equals one hundred percent of the number) to determine how tall the sunflower from package B was after the seeds of packet A were planted. By using the following formula: percentage = 100% * result/total\nWe can determine the height of packet A after seeds have been placed. The following formula will work for the formula given above. 0.2 * 0.192 = 0.0375. Since 0.0345 = 0, one of the seeds of package B is equal to 0.035 * 0.20 = 0.1 of the height of the seeds of the packet A.\nAs a result, what we must do is multiply the height of one packet of A seeds by 40/100 to get the final height of the entire seed packet. Then, we subtract the height of one seed packet from that of the other to get the answer.\n1. What is the total height of the whole packet of seeds?\n0.2 * 100 = 2.\n0.192 + 0.2 + 0.0369 = 0.5. Therefore, the height of the entire packet of seeds is 1.2.\n2. What is the height of one seed from Packet B after the seed of packet A has been added?\n0.04 * 0.10 = 0.004. The height of one seed of packet A added is0.2\n0.03 and the height of the sextet is 0. The answer is that the height of the entire seed package is 0. The total height of the whole sextet is 1.2\n3.

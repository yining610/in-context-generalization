{"text": "94 \n\nInput: This is an excellent example of \"knee-jerk\" journalism for those who are unfamiliar with the term:   the reporter takes a brief glance at a situation,  jumps to the wrong conclusion,  makes wild assertions,  and is reluctant to do research to find the facts.  A reporter who suffers from this problem often has a vested interest in making \"headlines\" because, by virtue of their publication, they can earn some money through advertising,  even without actually researching each and every story.  One might call this a case of \"beat reporting,\"  in that reporters do a lot of research on a specific area,  to the point where they get the details of every story,  and in the process,  learn to \"hype.\"  Many news agencies have been known to produce this type of material.  A well educated reporter should never fall into this trap, no matter how tempted.  I was asked to give my opinion regarding journalistic integrity.  This is an excellent example!\nOutput:  I'm going to make a serious statement just for the record:  I think that these people are complete morons.  If they were actually doing some research into this,  they would find out that there are many,  many people in San Bruno who don't want more density.  San Bruno is only 12 squares miles, so it's not as if there's a whole lot of room there, and in fact,  the residents are very concerned about the noise and traffic.  The city of San Bruno doesn't want it because it will be too much of a burden for San Francisco.  There are no jobs there,  no place to get a good nights sleep,  it will bring in even more traffic,  in addition to the light pollution and noise that will come along with it.  San Francisco already has problems with traffic and noise.  I'm amazed that any reporter with any sense would make such an idiotic statement.  It seems to me that there's only this small little article that mentions 3 cities,  and it doesn't say anything about San Bruno.  If journalists weren't so lazy, they would find out the facts and do a good job with reporting.   \n\t\t\nInput: To become a", "answer": " 360"}

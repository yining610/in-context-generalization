In order to ensure that code is safe the following should be kept in mind:\n\nThe basic rules for teaching children to program include:\n\n**Limiting the time to prevent obsessiveness and overcompensation.**\n\nWhen they have an excuse for everything they say or do, we know that they've got us trained.\n\nThat's why the best way to keep a kid's programming sessions from running out of control is to let them know when they're nearing the one-hour mark.\n\nAt this point, you'll want to say something like, \"OK, we have 15 minutes left. What can you do in such a short time?.\" This has the effect of bringing them back to reality and making them think about how to prioritize the work they've done so far. The most important thing, though, is to keep them on track and provide opportunities for them to take breaks and come back later.\n\n**Limits on the number of coding hours per week.**\n\nAnother point to ponder is how much time the kid is spending coding. In general, it's good for kids to have something else on their agenda in this area so that they don't get too obsessive.\n\nOn a general note: it's important to keep in mind that while learning to code is incredibly beneficial for kids, it is still just a form of programming and thus requires discipline. If it's not treated with an appropriate amount of care, it can quickly turn into a black hole of nonproductive time.\n\n### Input \n```\n16 \u00f7 4\n```\n\nThis is not a safe example to use because we are not using any variable, we are using the built-in value of 16.\n\n### Output:\n```\n4\n4/16 = 1 \n5/16 =.3125\n```\n```\n1\n```\n\n* * *\n## Author: [Shenna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shennaparker", "answer": " 19"}

A meter is 1 million millimeters and the eggs weigh 0.0026 mm which is more than 3,000 times the mass of a neutron. To get their weight, divide the mass of one neutron by a million.\n-Using the formula for a normal tarantula, there are 2514 legs on an egg sac\n-The second step is determining the number of legs on each egg sac. This makes the equation a little easier. The number of baby legs on one egg sac is a quarter of the number of legs on the tarantulas themselves.\n-To be sure that this is correct, compare it to the formula you did above.\n-Now you should know that there are 1018 legs on 6 egg sacs.\n-The final step is to find how many baby legs are in a single egg sac because it is easy and a single egg sac is equivalent to 6 of them.\n-Finally, you should know that there is a single egg sac, there are a total of 1000 legs are missing as compared to before\n-The baby legs in just one egg sac are equal to -1(3)\n-Therefore, 8888 is the answer for the given question", "answer": " 32000"}

After I divide by the initial weight to find the initial jelly beans, I will multiply the answer by 2 because I am looking for the number now in the box by using subtraction to find how many I will add to the final answer.  After the second amount of jelly beans are added to the box I multiply them again by 3 after subtraction to get the number of jelly beans being added back into the box so I will divide by the final amount of jelly beams remaining. Once I have the number of jellybeams in the box I add the gummy worms and then multiply the amount of worms and subtraction the answer by 2 when I am finally doing multiplication.

There are 46 gallons in the bigger tank. The smaller tank has five times more fish, in other words there are 180 gallons worth of fish in the smaller tank. So if the 2 inch fish eat a fish, then the rule of thumb is one gallon of water to each fish in the bigger tank, if 1 fish has a gallon of water, then 2 fish have 2 gallons of water. In other words, if 2 fish have 1 gallon each, then 1 fish has 1 gallon. So the amount of fish increases to 41 fish by the same amount. In other words, when the 3 inch fish in the bigger tank eat one that was in the smaller tank with the 2 inch ones, then there are more fish by one.\n\nInput: The rule is 1 gallon per inch of fish, in other words, 5 gallons per inch. There is half the amount of fish in the big tank so 2 inch fish, that equals 5 gallons of fish. There are 130 gallons fish times two inch fish = 65 gallons. There are twice as many fish, so 3 inch fish equal two times 6.5 gallons is 13 gallons", "answer": " 3"}

The Russians had many of their men killed too, but their numbers are twice as large than the other army's. How many Russian soldiers were in the army?\n\n### Demostration\nThe answer is 8,562 because 4 times 2 is 8 and 5 times 6 is 30 and 2 times 16 is 32. So you would have 8,560 but some people are not perfect which is why you round the numbers up to get an answer of 8,56 because the closest number is 8,5.\n\n### Answer:\nThe answer is: 864, the first thing we need to do is get the values to know how many Russians or men there were in the army because we don't know the numbers. If we had a calculator, we would multiply 25 and 33, but there were two armies on each side so what I did was get the values to 2 and 3 and double the numbers on the second army side. So 2 times 2 is what? 4, and 3 times 3 is? 9 and then 2 times 4 is 8, and 4 times 9 is 36 so 9 times 9 is what? and 36 times 2 is 72 and then add the remaining values which is 72, and 8,64, which is what the answer is.\n\n### Exercise:\nWhat is 35^16 divided by 94,900\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst we know the 35^1 and that was 35 because we started from the bottom so what is 35^2, so 35^2 is what?

{"text": "16 ounces\n\n### Explain:\nWe can break this problem into two parts, the smallest, medium and largest. We cannot break the combined rate.\n1) Start with the smallest, it leaks 1/3 rate that the medium. This means it leaks.3 x 3, this is 0.9 oz. This is the amount it will leak until the 2 minute mark.\n2) At the 2 minute mark, we can plug in that the smaller hole leaking 1/3rd the medium hole. That means it leaks.6 x 3, and the 2+ minutes has leaked.6 x 3 which is 1.8 plus the smaller size,.6 x 3 is about 1.8 or 1.9. So, we now we have about 3-3.2 oz of water. At this rate we would have 0.9 per minute up to the 2 minute mark and then 1.9 oz per minute so, from the 2 minute mark on, we can now expect 2.54 oz of water per minute.\n3) Next we plug in the medium hole. The medium hole leaks at about a half the rate of the largest. That is about 2.5 x 1.5, that is about 4 oz per minute.\n4) We just have to know how long the medium hole is leaking for. For now we keep calling it 2 hrs.\n5) From point 2, the medium hole has been leaking at 4.0oz/min, and that is for the first 2 min. We had the medium sized hole leak at a rate of 2oz +.6 x 3=7.2oz. So far, when the math works out, it has leaked 7.2 oz after 2m. This means that after 2 mins, the total we should be up to is 11.2 oz. So now the amount leaking is 11.9oz/min.\n6) From the point 2, we left off at 2.54 and we now have added.6( the medium) so.6(1.5) is approx.9 plus 2.6 = 4.5. Therefore our leak is now 5.4", "answer": " 600"}

{"text": "Let's use a binary number for this scenario where we have 2 of each type of number: one for the guests, one for the friends they each bring, and one for the guests that bring no friends. We can do this because the number of guests stays the same so we don't really need to account for each additional guest, but if there were 2 or so different kinds of people, it would get more complicated.\n\nFirst, the guests all bring their own friends. So that's 52. Then the guests tell their friends to bring a guest. But each guest already has a friend, so there are 4 more guests in total. So now we have 56.\n\nNow we do the same process to count the friends who were invited and the friends that each of them invited. But this time, the guest doesn't have a friend each time, so there are actually 2 that the 1st guest brought and the other 17 are the friends that each of the guests brought (there were 20 guests).\n\nSo now we combine the counts we got from each guest above into a total for the guest (3) and the friend (5) and the friends they each brought (36). Then we add the guest that each guest brought (2).\n\nThis is the way we set up a number to work with all at once. This is called a set. The way we did it was called a two set operation. We did it this way because we knew that no guests each brought more than one friend, there were no more kinds of people than guests, and guests and friends each brought some friends.\n\nSo we count the guests, then the guests that the guests each bring, and the friends each guest brought. Then each of the friends each bring a friend, and finally the friend that the guests bring. For guests, we count 56 total. We have 20 guests, each of them brought a friend, and the friends that each guest brought made up another 36 guests, for a total of 56 that we add guest together.\n\nIn the end, if half of the invited guests each invited 1 person, you can find the total because you already counted them and their friends and the friend each guest brought because they told you each person they brought. So it's just a matter of getting the total number of invited guests and summing it with the friends each guest", "answer": " 31"}

If air resistance can be ignored, how far will an object initially traveling upwards with speed v1 fall before it slows to a speed of just v1m/2?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe speed at which the object drops should be the same as its initial speed, so v1 = v2. The initial velocity of the stone is 0 as shown below:\nv^2 = 0 = 2*v2 as shown below:\nWe are told that v2 is half its initial velocity, so v2 = (0/2)*x.\nAs the object drops, its speed squared will be reduced by 2x as follows:\n(0/2)*x+x\nSolution:  x = x/2\nx is now reduced to half its original speed and will reach the bottom at half its initial speed: v = (0/2)x/2\nThe total distance that the object will drop, D, is thus given by the equation: D = v*T where T = Time it drops. Thus, distance, D becomes: D = v*S\n\n### InputWhat type of object would a person on the moon experience greater weight as gravity on the moon is 62.5% of Earth?

This means she will sink (because the net force is an attractive force) a height of 9 inches.\n\n### Output:\nGiven the diagram below:\n\nDraw the tension in each string.\n\n### Solution:\nThere are two strings, the first one (at the bottom left of the diagram) starts at 9 o'clock (draw the angle of the string) and ends at 4 o'clock, so it would pull to the 4 o'clock side with an angle of about 51 degrees. The second string (the one in the middle of the diagram) is at the 7 degree angle and is at the 4 o' clock side, this would push the string to an angle of about 73 degrees.\n\nHowever these angles would work counter-clock wise. So in the diagram, since the first string is tensioned, it would move the object to the 51 degree or 7 o'clock. While the second is not tension to pull it, but to push it. So in the diagram the object would move counterclockwise to the 73 degree or 3 o'clock. The string that is pulling or tensioned the object would then be on the 3 o'clock", "answer": " 7"}

We can say $150 because we get to subtract $6 from it. When he goes to the cash register he gets his money back but he has to add $10 but no $6. They got $30 as refunds.

From here I saw the distance formula and tried to come up with an equation to solve the problem.\n\nThe formula I used was : \n\ny = mx + b\n\ny being the number of miles and m and b being variables.\n\nI used this formula because\n\nthe answer I wanted was to plug in the values into an equation to figure out a answer.\n\nThe value that I plugged in was M and B.\n\nA = rate at which Bobby needed to use gasoline.\n\nb  = the amount of gasoline left.\n\nI set up the formula and plugg in A, M, and B.\n\nThe answer \n\ny = 3m + 125.5\n\nwhich is miles.\n\nNow 2 gallons left, I just plugged in 2 m and 123.5 (b) into the formula and i got the answer to be 0.35 miles per gallon.\n\nI am now done and the next part of the problem did not ask for the answer I was looking for but rather for the rate, the math I used to solve this problem will help me understand the rate.\n\n### Note:You will need to understand math formulas if the question is based on one. The formula will usually be provided or you can learn one to use.\n### Note:Formulas are not always necessary to understand a sentence or a paragraph but when a formula is given it always helps to solve the question. There will be different problems that will require you to use formulas. Understanding how to properly read a question and what formulas are needed will greatly increase your chances of understanding the problem and scoring the correct amount.\n\n### Review:For more practice understanding how to solve this problems review the [Demonstration section](Demonstration.md).", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "Answer : First, calculate the total amount of caffeine in a 250 -gram can of 12 ounces- 250 mg x 18ml/gram = 4500 mg per can. Divide by 2 to account for how much he will drink of each energy drink, as each drink is 12 ounce. So 4-5400/2 = 2200 mg per drink.  Now we have to account for the caffeine in the pill. It is 250 mgs per 655 mg of 30 grams.  So 30:250= 0.12. This means thhat for every 12 grams of the pill, there is 1 mg of caffeine, and there are 30 grams of cfaience in pill, so we multiple by 12.  So we will just subtract the caffeine from pill from drinks total amount of caffiene.  The total amount of caffene in the pill is 3600 mg.  So 3600-4500- 2200 = 250  mg of caffiene.\n\n\n### Instructor Response:\n\nThe correct answer was not found anywhere in the response the author provided.

To calculate this, you will have to define an operation that is applied to smaller parts\nUntil it is fully evaluated. It may begin with 1 as an input.

The \"for\" loop is used to perform a particular function for a certain amount of times. The \"while\" loop is used to repeatedly evaluate boolean expressions and to run the statements inside the while block while the expression is true. This instruction asks for a function input that accepts one value. If the value that was entered is an integer, it should return 3, otherwise, it should return 4.  \n\nFor this assignment, we used our \"if\" statement because they wanted the function, ifValue == 3, to return 3, if it's!= 3, the function should return 4.\n\n```javascript\nfor (var i = 0; i < 4; i++) {\n    if(value == 3) {\n        return 3;\n    } else {\n        return 4;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Response #2:\nWe were taught about loops earlier this semester but the material we received from this tutorial is not applicable to my team's function.

The problem with it is that you are asking the students to have the answer ready when they submit their response.

There are two heavy ashes, 4 regular washes, and an extra light wash so 6 washes is needed. You do 2 heavy washes that use 50 gallons so that is 100 gallons use. You do 2 regular washes, 4 regular use 50 gallon each other so another 200 gallons. You do 2 light washes, 8 light washes so there is an extra water use that is 16 gallons. The last step is to be able to do 2 bleached washes that have light wash cycles so the last two washes have an extra water usage so add those up to another 40 gallon use.

If I multiply 500 by half because I know she doesn't waste any money I know she has about $225 in the fund because $500 is not 2/3 of $500. This is where we do a lot of questioning about $225 does it make sense, because if I am correct in my thinking $225 would be half of $200 and half of $100 and half of the rest of the money which means $225 is not a full whole number and if it is not then multiply it by 1/2 and I will know the rest. This means that if I go ahead and do what I just said and try to add them up myself and see I will see that $225 is equal to only $112 dollars and 100 cents.

Now we divide the 10.15 by 2, which is $5.08. Finally we multiply $5.08 by 2 to get $10. You must add that to the other $10.14 to get $20.14. You will then subtract the amount spent ($10) from the original amount ( $20.15) to get ($10.15- $10.00) $5.05. Now, half ($2.52) is what's left when you divide $5.05 by 2. When she spent half that amount, or $2.52 she brought the dollar amount to $2.43.\n\nInput: What is the value of x if a/x = 0.5?\n\n### Demontation:\nIf you know the x intercept of a linear equation, you can find the value of x by taking the 100 over the 0.5 (1) which gets you a value of 200. Now take the x from the original equation (x) to 2. It is 0.5, so 0.5= 200 x. So x is equal to 1%.\n\n### Inputs:\n* The original value of x in the original equation is 10\n* The value of x is 1\n\n### Demosntration:\nIn an equation with variables, when you take the product of the variables to isolate an unknown variable (usually the y- variable), you are finding their product.

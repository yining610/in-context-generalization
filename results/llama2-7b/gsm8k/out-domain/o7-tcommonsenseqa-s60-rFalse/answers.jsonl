For example, 413 is equivalent to 13, and 672 is equivalent to 62. When multiplying two such integers, the result should be used as the next, longer variable, and the first integer should get incremented or decremented to the next step to give the next number. If a multiple of the tens digit is needed, the tens digit goes in again, but it retains its previous value, unchanged. For example, 754 would be equivalent to 452. What is 267 x 382?\nOutput: 5694\n\nInput: Four integers (positive or fractional, non-zero and non-infinity) are used to describe a location. The first is the minutes digit. For example, -4.554 is equivalent to 445. The next three integers are used to describe the seconds, thirds, fourth, and fifth digits, respectively. The four integers are combined into a single number, where for the last third place the fourth integer is added to the tens place, which should be 000. For example, -1.944 is equivalent to 1944 and 4.944 is 4944. For example, if the fourth integer, the second third place, is 387, this would make the answer 1944 + 387 = 2331.

Why did the teacher want the student use the 521 and 147 instead of 1.? How would the student have if he did not know?\nAnswer: The teacher was trying to make sure the student understood the difference between the decimal notation and the fraction notations for a whole number.\n\nIn the decimal notation 147 is the number that is used because the decimal notation is 1,4,7, not 1.1, 4,7 \n\nIn the fraction notation the value 147 is in between the numbers 1 half and 5 two thirds.\n\nIn the fraction 521 if we were to represent this as a decimal we would get 5.2 (not 1.5)\n\nThe teacher was making sure the student use notation that the teacher thought would help the student make their value clearer. That the student was able to use 147 is because the student understand notation and the teacher did not want the student to confuse decimals with fractions because 147 is different than 1.47 and the teacher wanted the student to use the actual notation 147 instead because it is the notation value of the fraction 1 half and 4 two thirds.\nThe teacher also wanted to make sure the student had the knowledge", "answer": " 49"}

As the girls tried to reason with her, they were making arguments that were based on false premises. The problem with these arguments was that they didn't start on the same point that the teacher started on. Instead, they kept arguing that what they were saying was the truth. That's because the teacher began with a false assumption. In fact, that assumption was an assumption based on a previous assumption. In other words, it was an over-generalization and an overestimation. In a way, this proves the teacher was right. What's more, the girls seem to think \"there weren't any arguments to be reasoned\", which is not the case. There was the argument made by the girl, but it seemed to be so much more than that. If we take the argument made by the teacher to be reasonable, then we see that it was made in a reasonable way. So the teacher was right. She didn't just \"get bored\" because she was bored. Instead, she was making arguments that were based off of false premises. If we think about the different ways the girls could have made arguments, it seems that some are more likely to be right than others. If we were to make the argument based on the premises (and it could work if it were a better premise), then we would see that the teacher didn't just get bored. If we think about all the different ways the girls made arguments, it's likely that the argument made by the girls doesn't count as a good argument.

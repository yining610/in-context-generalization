Here\u2019s how to solve it.\nFrom the information given in the question, we know that for every minute that she sings on stage for the final opera performance, Carlotta spends an additional 5 minutes practicing and 3 minutes throwing tantrums.\n\nIf Carlotta\u2019s performance is six minutes long, we want to solve for the total minutes that she will spend singing, throwing tantrums and practicing.\n\nSince it states the final performance is 6 minutes, we also know for sure that each of the three times Carlotta will sing on stage will be 2 minutes long.\n\nTherefore, Carlotta will spend 3 minutes throwing tantruims for each of the 2 minutes she will sing on stage.\n\nSo, if Carlotta spends a total of 15 minutes on stage, then she will spend 30 minutes throwing tantrums and will practice for 20 minutes.\n\nTo determine how much she will sing we add 12 (the two minutes added for each tantrum) and 10 (the two minutes she will add for singing after each tantrum) and she will sing for a total of 22 minutes.\n\nSo, we know that Carlotta will sing for 8 minutes, practice for 10 minutes and throw tantrums for 20 minutes for the 6 minutes on stage she will perform in the final opera.\n\nAnd finally,\n\n$ Carlotta will spend a total of 195 minutes practicing, throwing tantumms and singing.", "answer": " 54"}

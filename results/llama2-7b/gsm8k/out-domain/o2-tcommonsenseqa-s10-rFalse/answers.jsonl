{"text": "Carly has collected 45 arms total.\n\n### Explain:\nSeveral examples can be drawn from the task to show that it's difficult to determine whether these tasks are about arithmetic/mathematical thinking versus language understanding.\n\nFirst, some of the questions are about interpreting wording and some about interpreting quantitative information.\n\nSecond, there isn't any reason to interpret \"Fabric is cut to order\" as meaning cut to order for curtains.  Rather, the expression \"cut to order\" can mean that the fabric is cut to order, by a tailor, such as when someone needs to go to a tailor.\n\nThird, I don't see any reason to determine a context for \"Fabric is ordered\" other than maybe \"by the customer,\" and it is equally reasonable to say \"Cut to order\" refers back to the previous phrase in the sentence.  Therefore, the task is somewhat of a strawman task (a task that is hard to solve because it requires more knowledge and domain understanding than the tester does).\n\nTherefore, in order to make such a task easier, you could provide a choice list or allow the tester to provide a different answer.\n\n### Hints\n\n```bash\n### Hint: Consider which questions you'll provide a choice list; which questions are open-ended.\n### Hint\nWhat are the pros and cons of requiring the tester to provide the number she's thinking of?

The question is asking how many grapes does Borris need in a year but it didn't give us an input regarding the number of grapes required before increasing his production. So my assumption is based on the data that we have:\n\n**Fabric is cut to order:** This is cut to order because he would need an estimate of the number of years they needed to order more fabric. It doesn't make sense to go to the fabric store to buy a 10000 meters when you have a business that requires only 10 meters only. So we need to solve the problem for this condition to be valid.\n\n**Where are you if your reading the magazines while waiting on the train?:** It is in a bookstore if we don't want to be late waiting for the train. There are some train stations that would give out magazines for free.\n\n**Borris liquor needs 90 kilogar of grapes:** That was given to me and I only have the knowledge that his liquor shop was producing 90 kilogares of grapes per 6 months and now he is thinking or increasing it by 20% which is equal to 0.2.\n\n**Based on the information we have I would suggest that Borris liquor needed 97.930 kilogares of raipes for the year**\n\nInput:Borris liquors needs 90 kilo of grapes in 6 months.

{"text": "There are 24 rolls leftover\n\n### Demostration:\nTo find the amount of dinner rolls left, we take the first set of half the people eat 1.5 rolls each as half of 16, which equals 8 people ate.5 of the rolls. Then we added the second number of people, and took 1/2 of a roll for half of the people, and that would be 4 people. These two sums would be added together giving us the number of rolls leftovers. To get the last number, we found the sum, added the amount of people. Since 16 is a factor of 32, we found the two factors from the middle, and this gives us 8 left over.\n\n### Input : 6 people are in a group, there are 4 bottles of water. The first 3 people take one bottle of water each. The last person takes the last bottle of water so now there is 1 bottle of water left for the next person. What number of people have one bottle of water?\n\n### Demotstration:\n\nTo find out the amount of people after the first 3 take water,\nI decided to find the factor with the number of people. which is 2, because 3 is a factor of 6 and I can multiply 2, 6/2=3 so 3 cancels out so the new number would be 2. Since there is currently 4 and the last has the last bottle of the water, it is simple to add this to the new number I found. Now I subtract the 6 from the 4 to find that 8 would be removed from 4 and the answer would be 4.\n\n### Task:\nTo answer this question, you should answer yes. The instruction is that you should be able to answer this question without a previous knowledge of how an instruction is written. However, the question would be something along the lines of: Find what number of people is able to write something.

An ideal type of data can be a set of points connected by a line, for example: a data set containing mathematical points. There is data can be an object or a collection. For example: a set containing measurements. In statistics, a data set is a small or large collection of data to be evaluated statistically.\nWhen performing analyses of data is necessary that the data are collected from the right sources. In performing analyses of a data set can be divided into raw data. Also, they can be categorized by collecting information on how these items are organized or aggregated. The data can be grouped into classes or a category, and the data can have classes, or they can be quantitative.\nData can be divided into several categories or classes. They can be grouped based on their value, for example: a group of data, a group of classes, or they can have variables, for example: a variable group of data for each variable.\nAnalysis of data can be a mathematical process used to determine the relationships between two or more variables such as frequency. To perform an analysis of data sets, an appropriate test or experiment is performed to determine if there is a difference between the two or more variables.\n### Output:\nI have analyzed your information and I have completed my task.

{"text": "To answer this question, it helps to know the difference between per-minute costs and total costs for Janet.  Her per-minute costs for her 120 minutes of filming the new movie will be double her per-minute costs when filming her previous 120 minute movie.  We can easily find a total cost of filming 120 minutes by using the formula C=t (per-minute cost) * 120 (minutes).  Therefore, C=100 (per-minute) * 12 (120/10) = 1200 total cost to film 120 minutes.\n\nNow, we just have to multiply her per-minute cost by her total length to get her total cost for the entire film.  Therefore:\n```\nC = 50 per-min (120/60) + 60 to (120%2 to original length) *60\n```\nWe can simplify the equation to this:\n```\nC=1560\n```\nSince that result is less than the total cost asked for, the answer is 500.", "answer": " 1920"}

She must subtract the amount she already has saved ($41,651) and the amount she can spend ($41,604) from her 30% to be left with $127.

{"text": "Answer: This problem can be done with 2 addition subtraction, multiplication and division. First multiply 53 *1.5 = 80.5. Then multiply 35 *1 = 35. Second divide 75*2 = 150. And third times 37 *2= 74. So if they use 2 eggs per omelet then they should buy 25*2 = 50 eggs.\n\n### Input\n\n### Output: What is the cost of a pair of sneakers if the first pair cost $65 and the 2nd pair cost was $30 and an additional $5 for a bag to transport the sneakers. Give your answer as a number with the dollar sign as well.\n### Demontration:\nCalculating this problem is complicated because you need to use addition, subtraction, multiplication of 2 different rates and division. The formula used to solve this problem is : (rate)*(number of pairs of shoes) - (cost of first pair of shoes). You can use addition or subtraction for simple cases and multiplication or division for complicated cases.\nFirst you need to put the dollar value in the equation and in this case the total you've putted is $70.05 which is wrong, you must subtract the cost of the first pair of shoes from it. We used addition because we're dealing with single-digit numbers. So, $70.0 - $65 = $5\n\n### Response\nGive your answer with the dollar sign plus the cents. (example: $85.01) and this is the result.\n\n### Solution:\n```\nvar add = 65 +( $30 *2) + ($5 *3) =85.01\n```\nYou can solve this problem by subtract or divide because you're dealing with simple rate.\n```\nvar sub = $65 -65 =$0\nvar div = ( $65 /2) *3 =$15\n```\nFinally you can use division to get the cents or round the cents to the next whole dollar value.\n\n```\nvar modifier = ( $65 % 2) * 3\n//$65 %2 returns 3", "answer": " 584"}

{"text": "The total number of gum balls that he purchased is 25. \n\nHector purchased a container _______ gum balls. ____ and he gave five less than four times as he had given to ____. ___ then he gave 4 to ____. He had ____ that he had given to ____ when he was done.\n\n#### Subtask One:\n\nIf you are to subtract 5 from four times a number to get the number of gumball sold how many gumballs would that be? That number would be 24 because 4 times 24 would subtract 5 equals 24. Now if you subtracted five from four times four gumballs that would be 16. So now you got 16 left over, 16 is one more than 15 so what he bought the containers for would have to be 16 more than 15 if there are six remaining. To find that out just divide 16 over six, this would give you four. This solution would be 16 over 6. If you add twelve and four that would be 10. Then do the multiplication 16 over 10 the result would be 1.6. Now that you can find the number of gum balls he purchased. Now that we have got the answer we will explain how we got to 25. The first one is:  Hector purchased a container.\n\n#### SubTask Two:\n\nHector gave 4 to Tod. There would be 16 left over now. Now he said he gave 2 times the amount to Asal. Which would be 8 and then after that he handed 5. Now there are 4 out of the container left, (4 - 8 = 4) now there is 12 left so he gave 2 more until 12 were left. So the number of gum ball he purchased is 16 +8 +4 (twice) +2 (2 times 4) +1 (12) = 25.\nNow we need to explain the total and how many gum balls are left. The total would be 8 +3 + 5 + 2 = 18 + 5 = 23.\n\n#### Sub Task Three\n\nSo to explain what you said that he had 6 gum balls", "answer": " 45"}

There are better ways of conveying this question than the way it was written, probably by using math as the basis of questions. The \"inputs\" and \"outputs\" were written clearly.

{"text": "There were four boys, nine girls, and four that were not able to join, so there were 13 students in all.", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "Answer :4 boys went on the trip. Let `n` be the number of girls. Clearly, `n-2` girls received n eggs. So, each girl received 2 eggs. The three women get `3n-6` eggs. The number of eggs each girl receive is `2*(n-6)`. So, there are three women and some snack which is not counted among eggs. So, `n` girls got `n-6` eggs, and `4(n-6)` eggs were given to men. We can solve the below question as well, to calculate the number of eggs remaining, `n(n-6)`. `n` girls is equal to the number of eggs left for men which is `4(n-5) * 2(n-6)`=6*(n-5). So, `n`, the number of eggs left, is `6*(n-5) - 4`. If `n = 13` and there are `n=3` men, then the 13th girl has remained. The boys are 3-n and girl is n-3. So, the boys are 3-3+1=3. Since there are 7 girls, there will be 7 boys and we have to find how many boys are left. So, `n-2 = 3-3+0`. So, there are `3-3+0` boys in total which is 3 boys. Hence, the answer is `3`.\n\n### Comment:\n\n1. I think the question requires number of eggs remaining\n2. If `n=3`, then `n-3 =2` since you counted the 3 girls already, so there are total 4 boys(n-3 since you counted n, 2 since you counted 3 girls, and 0 since there is no eggs left)\n3. You can't count 3 eggs to 3 girls as you said `(n-6)`", "answer": " 10"}

To solve we take the equation we have 240 birds and subtract. Since the birds fly away subtract the value of the birds that fly away and since some birds were grey birds that value has to be 20 - 20.

We then multiply the number of times Susanna went by 4 because that's the number of times we're dividing by, and Susanna's total number of times she went in March is 4.\n\nNow, in the second question, we have to take a step back and think about how to convert the given units of measure: we know that 8 cm can be calculated by 16/2, so we know that we need to divide the amount of time Susannah goes by by this same fraction (8/2 = 4).\nLet's say there are 10 people altogether going to Jenny's party, so 10 x 5 would be 50. 50 is a multiple of 5 because 5 x 10 equals 50, so we know we need to divide by 5 to determine how many people went.

When full, she uses the garden hose to fill it. The garden hose is not powerful enough to fill, so she can only fill the pool slowing.  However, her pool leaks at the same time; which means that the pool continues to leak while she tries to fill it up.

{"text": "5\n### Explanation:\nThe street is made up of five total houses. each house contains 3 gnomes. With 20 gnomos in total, only one house left contains the remaining gnomos. To this point in the problem, five houses have already been counted, so this gives us a possible maximum number of gnomes. With five total houses that equates to 5x3= 15 which leaves another five gnomos, the final number being 5+15=20. This would then require the last house to have five gnomos.\n### Check:\nCheck and ask someone for clarification if:\n- The input makes sense.\n- The response is correct..\n- An answer is missing \n\n### Output:\n14: The answer to the provided question\n\n### Question:\nHow can you explain your response to the following request in a few sentences?\n\n\nInput: A. The price of a pair of socks is $4.50 plus sales tax that is 6 percent of the price. The sales tax is collected on cash transactions. If each payment contains $3, then what is the number of socks in a payment.\n\n\nResponse:\n```js\n\n\nvar priceAfterSaleTax = (A.price + (A.salesTax * A.taxRate));\n\n\n/*The logic behind the above formula is a sales tax of 6 percent on an item that costs $4.50 + $3 would result in $4.50 = price + $1.50 = taxRate. Because 6% of $4.50 is $1.50, then $1.50 \u00f7 12 is.125 which means the tax rate is 6%.\n\nThis is important to note because 6 percent would be calculated as follows  $4.50 x 6% = $0.27 = $0.25 + $0.02.\n\nTo reiterate, 6% = $4.50/ ($4.50 +.25).\n\nIf we were to solve for x, it would be the price of a pair of shoes. When we apply this logic to the sock example the calculation is:\n $4.50 \u00f7 $1", "answer": " 8"}

The market usually sells produce such as fruits, greens, veggies etc. I usually buy my daily groceries here.\n\n### Where are you if your listening to music whiles waiting for a vehicle on rail? A) vegetables B) market C) doctor D) train station E) bookstore\n\nIn my opinion, when you are on a train it would be convenient to have a book with you that would allow you to read while you wait. This would be especially relevant if you were waiting for someone who is late, or waiting for a friend that you are meeting on the train. For me, having a book is much more relaxing than reading a magazine. Books are for learning and magazines are mostly to be entertained. Although many of us will always have a copy of the latest news, the best books are books that teach!\n\n### B: market \n\nMarkets are a public area that sells a range of commodities. To be certain of what I am trying to say, I think it is better to say a market is a location, (usually outside) where people, usually those from a specific geographic region, can get an assortment of goods that typically include fresh produce. Fruits, vegetables, meat, fish, etc, are all commonplace at a local market. Also, marketplaces frequently have clothes and housewares for sale.\n\n### D: train station\nI usually listen to my music either on the spotify app so they can't get me to listen to a song that is not on my station.  If I listen to the radio, I sometimes want to change the station on the radio because the song gets too slow and slows my heart rate down.\nIf I are waiting for the train, i tend to listen to a podcast if it is an easter that will be coming by.

Also, the function would end with the number of remaining conditions being zero.\n\n### Requirements:\n\nDisplay the answer correctly if true.\n\nDisplay the answer as if false, when it matches the condition \"Is false\".\n\nShow the number of remaining conditions.\n\nDisplay the remaining conditions in a message such as: `The other conditions are: \"Do not equal\"` when matching the condition \"Does not equal\".\n\n### Suggested Practice:\n\nWrite out all the options to possible inputs and their conditions.\n\nThen, think of possible conditions, and what the answer would look like.\n\nFinally, build a function that prints the correct results.\n\n### Output:\n\nHere are a few examples about what the function should do for the above inputs.\n\nInput: Fabric:\n\nResult: answer: A: curtains\n\nReason why it is not the correct answer: fabric is not a seller.\n\nNumber of remaining conditions: 0\n\nInput: train:\n\nResult: no answer\n\nNumber of remaining condition: 2\n\nInput: train station:\n\nResult: the answer: D: train station.\n\nInput: doctor`s office:\n\nResult: No answer.\n\nNumber of Remaining conditions: 2\n\n### Test Cases:\n\n| Name                | Value                       |", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "<div class=\"question\">Answer: Robi N. 2765.9688 sec\n\n### Feedback:\n\n  <p>\n    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Explanation:\n  <div class=markdown>\nIn order to find the number of cycles that are required to fill the tub, Robi multiplies the flow rate(12) by the number of liters in the tank(120). This number is 1440 to arrive at how many minutes it will take him to fill the tub. To find the number of cycles multiplying the flow rate(1) by the tank time is accomplished by multiplying the water flow rate by the time that Robi lets the water flow to fill the tank. Then the number of times the water cycle is multiplied by to determine the number of cycles. This results in Robi 1440 minutes. This method is useful if the flow rate of water is not constant or you have flow rate that fluctuates. This is because of this way the value is inversely proportional to the capacity of the tank. In addition, the capacity of the tank is not taken into account if the flow rate is constant or the one chosen for the flow rate is not the one flowing out of the tap. The answer for a large capacity tank is greater than the actual result by the number of cycles of flow that Robi makes at a standard flow rate. The solution here assumes that 120 liters in a tub is close to the actual amount in the tub. There are 3 different ways to solve this problem. These are, multiplying by the volume of the pipe or a container, adding a correction factor, then removing the correction factor, multiplying by the amount of fluid per unit time and finding the number of units, or dividing by the amount of fluid in units per unit time.\n  </div>\n  <p>  \n    &nbsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ensp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n### Instructions for Parts:\n    <div class = answer>\n</div>", "answer": " 24"}

DWIS is often used by companies to manage the day-to-day operations of the firm.\n\n##### The first sub-problem in DWIS focuses on how to use DWIS to monitor employee performance. The second sub-problem in DGIS focuses on how DWIS is able to analyze data and find patterns that may be helpful for business decisions and operations.\n\n##### An answer to both sub-problems in DGIS is \"yes, you do,\" because computer science relies heavily on the input of data from people. DGIS is a program that requires the input of people to process data and analyze results.\n\n### Problem solving, problem statements, problem solutions, and other issues\n\n##### The second sub-problem of the DWIS program, which focuses on how the software can aid in decision-making by analyzing data, is also a sub-problem of problem solving.

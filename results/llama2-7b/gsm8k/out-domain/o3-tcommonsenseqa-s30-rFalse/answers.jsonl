The Animal class definition contains a base constructor, and a constructor for Bird that inherits from animal and takes one more parameter. In order for the constructor to operate correctly, you need to create a Bird class. Create it using the same pattern as the Animal class. You will need to replace the Animal constructors with a bird constructor, that takes an int argument for the wing size and will need to include the setWings method.\n\n#### Problem\nWrite the constructor for the bird class like so:\n```java\npublic class Bird {\n   public int w,l;\n   public Bird (int w) //int w should contain information on the wings of the Bird\n   {\n      super(w); //This line calls the super class to initialize all necessary\n      //data\n   }\n \n   public void setWings (int W)\n   {\n      this.w = W; //sets wings according to the set W\n   }\n  ...\n}\n```\n\n\n\nThe Animal class should look something like this:\n```\npublic class Animal\n{    \n\tprotected final int w = 1;\n\tprotected final int l = 1;\n    //the setX and setY are necessary to set the properties of the animal\n\tpublic Animal(int x, int y) \n\t{\n        setX(x);  \n        setY(y);  \n\t}", "answer": " 200"}

So the range we want to find the average is 400.\n\n### How do we know how many hours the string is?\nTo know of how many hours the string of input values, you can convert the string into number then multiply that with each input value to get the total.\n\n###What to do for the first input?\n- Convert the input string of \"12012\" into a number. You cant just directly convert the string into numbder as 120112 will result in 13, since the number 1201 is not a valid number.\n-  Thus, since the number 0 is not a valid input, the input will be divided by 10 first.\n- This will give us 12, but we still not done yet. We can not directly convert 12 into a number either because since 12 is not a valid input either.\n- So to convert it into a number you can split the string and add them all together. 12+1 is the answer.", "answer": " 5"}

That is 336+212=548 books. \n\n### Input\n\nHow many numbers in the list:  15, 25, 35, 45?\n\n### Demostration\n\nFirst, We need to know if the numbers are prime or not, which is 15 yes, 25 yes, 35 not, 45 no.\nWe need to start at 15. The last digit is 5, we need to check if there is 5 in the list, if it is not there we will get a positive answer, if it is there we will get a negative answer. If the last digit is 5 and 45 is not there we get positive answer for sure. Otherwise, we know the last digit is positive and get to 15+35=50, if there is 50 in the list we get a positive answer. If 50 is not there we know the last digits are not there. We go to 35 now. The last digit is positive because there is a 5, if 35 is not in the list we get positive response. If 35 is there we need to check the last digit is positive by continuing again. Keep repeating until the last digit is not positive because you have already found it in the list. If the last digit was a positive number you got a positive response and if it was a negative number you get a negative response. Finally we get 0 answers if you find it in the list then it is not prime so you get a negative response and if you don't find it in the list you get a positive answer. Since there is a 5 in the list we got a positive answer.\n\n### Input for math:\n\n\n### Demosntration:\nIf x>= a then x>=22 which is equal to a=b. We take an example, if a=50 and it is greater than b=22 we know a>=22. If X is not greater than a then it must be less than a because 22>=50\n\n### Input math:", "answer": " 234"}

Then the gummy worms, brownies and jelly beans was 2 + 4 + 6 + 2 = 14, so the original weight would increase to 16 pounds. Then we find out the next value of jelly beans the box would have so 16 pounds + 8 pounds (28) + 4 pounds (32) = 44, so the value of jelly beams was 44. From the problem, the original weight doubled twice, so the final weight of the packed box was 44 divided by 2 = 22 pounds\n\n### Instructions\nWrite a response that appropriately supports your statement.\n1.

He told his boss, I have invented a device that is able to multiply a person's ability to do things. It allows them to work, not only with just their hands and their eyes, but with a fourth sensory organ. They will now be able to work equally using two sensory organs, as compared to just one before.\nThe boss asked him to show him how this is accomplished, and so he pulled out a tiny machine that had a green dial on it. With a dial he turned two to 40, and then switched the dial to the off position, He said to the boss, I have now shut off the machines ability to work with sense of smell and thus my employee is now able to work twice as effectively with just his two sensory organs left.\n\nThe boss then asked him what other sensory organs the machine can be used for, and so then the engineer went on to turn the dial up all the way to 40 and stated, Now I have shut down my employee\u2019s ability to work with all three sensory organs, thus my employee is now working with the fourth sensory organ, his heart to be twice as effective as before the device was used.\n\nAfter listening to his explanation, the boss told him it was a very interesting device and then thought to himself, \u2018I wonder how much more effective my employees would be if I use this device on them?\n\n### Demo \nOutput: This machine can help increase employee productivity.\n\n### Demo Answer\nThe machine would allow an employee to work more efficiently and more effectively because they can use this machine to shut off sense of smell and touch, thus making work easier and more enjoyable.\n\n### Why Demo Answer is correct\nThis machine can help increase employee effectiveness.\n\n### Output \nThe machine can help increase employee employee", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "The average number of leaves are calculated by (RateOfChange Per 1 Hour) = (8). The rate of change is found by dividing the number of leaves that fell that hour with the number of leaves that fall that hour. The amount of leaves that fell in the first hour is 7 and in hours 2-3, it is 4. The 2-3 hour rate of change is 4. That rate of change results in the total of 12, which can be added to the initial amount of 7. Then, 26 leaves fell in all through hours 1-3. That amount is divided by 3 to result in the average amount of leaves which fell per 1 hour as 9 leaves.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question asks for the average number of leaves that fell in 1 hour during 2-3. To know the average in hour 1-2, you have to find the average in each hour and then add 2 to the result of all average and divide 2 by that. So, to know the average for hour 1-2 and 13 in total, first we have to find out the average.\n\nThe average of 9 in hours 1 and 2 is calculated using the rate of change method.

{"text": "The most likely outcome for the first lawsuit is a $0 pay out. It has a very low chance of paying $5 million due to the extremely low chance, 30%. A winning pay out for the second lawsuit has a much higher probability, 50%, but there is also a high probability for a losing pay out, 50%. Thus, the final expected amount gained for the first lawsuit only amounts to $0 with a 30% probability. The second lawsuit, however, has the very high gain amount of $2 million, but again, it has an extremely likely (50%) chance of loosing the pay out, which lowers the total expected gain amount. So in summary, the total expected gain for the two lawsuits is a $2 million gain for the second lawsuit with a 50% probability, and a $0 gain for the first lawsuit. The difference between the two expected gains is a $500,00 win for each lawsuit, resulting in the answer of $1 million.", "answer": " 20"}

She ate the chips on Monday, sandwiches Tuesday, Cereals Wednesday, chips on Thursday, and Salad Friday. The only other day of the week that she ate either cereals or salad was Friday.\n\nShe decided to write a script that uses the numbers of lunches prepared for 5 consecutive work days, but because of her absence on Wednesday, she had to calculate the missing information and produce the final answer. Therefore, she had to write a script to add 350, 350, and 400, 345, and 405, and divide the total of three by the number of days.\n\nTo complete the task, she has to make an addition of 350 + 400 + 350 and divide it by 3, and calculate 3500 / 3 = 1166 (approximately).

Because they use 2 miles a minute, x=1 mile/2=1/2 mile (A*x=B). This is 6*1=6 minutes of a head-start. 6 mins*120 s per mile=720 s. We divide by 720=720/720=1.

Kyle's mother is Katie (last name Tucker) so Katie is 20 years old.\n\n### Input\n\n\n\nThe next exercise is called a *response*, which is a complete expression which matches up with the example expression below it. The first step in this exercise is to see what input was submitted to the task.\n\nInput: The lab's results had been compiled. The scientist began analyzing the data so he could learn more about\n\n\n\nSo how do we go about matching an expression to this input? There are two things to remember here: we'll be replacing the symbols in the input with literal strings, just as we did earlier.\n\nWe can see that this task will be looking for a name in an input, and then asking the question, how old was this person when they graduated from high school? The name doesn't matter, but it must be a name that will allow the data to pass the filtering rule later in the task. So let's call this person \"Bill.\"\n\n\n\nNow, we'll begin to develop our expression by adding a literal string to the expression first. The first step will be to replace all the symbols with literal strings. The symbols in this task are `->`, `+`, `=>`, `+`, `~` (`~` is used as a string delimiter).\n\nSo we go into the expression editor and replace all the symbols with quotes. So `\"<\" -> \">\"` will become `\"<\" \">\"`. The next step is to replace the variables in the expression. \n\n\n\nThe variables in this task are: *`<`* - for an input string, *`>`* - for an output string, and then there are the literals we are replacing these symbols with like *`a`*, *`\"billi\"`*, *`\"high `\" + \"school\"`* etc.\n\n\n\nThere are a few rules when it comes to matching variables to the variables that they need to take. First, it must be the same, and second, it must make a logical sense. For this assignment, only variables can match variables. So in this task, as you can see we are replacing `a` with *", "answer": " 22"}

Are theses results are inconsistent? If so, which results? Explain why.

It seems like if the rates of crimes are above 50%, then that person is likely to report the crime.  \n\nYou see! the crime rate is the factor that determines whether a person will report the crime. That is the reason why the second survey has a different result than the first one.\n\n### Output\nAs a result of these surveys, I conclude that if the rates of crimmrate is above 50%, residents are 8 times more likely o report their cars stolen, and the crime rates in neighborhood are less than the average crime rates.", "answer": " 36"}

There are 420 student in a school. This statement is not clear that the 420 students are equally distributed and how much it will be allocated to the students.\n\nHowever, the calculation can be revised to 420/x * x. I found this is the best solution since the total amount of money is divided equally to the number of students. x is the total amount of money allocated and x is the amount of each student. I found that it should not be divided equally since each student has different requirements hence, I allocate different amount of money to each student.(eg. 40/20*20=40)\n\n### Instructions\nHow much should be charged for each item at a store that sells pans at $19.95 and ladders at $41.40?\n\n### Instructor's Guide\nSales Tax should be charged for each transaction in a store regardless of the price.\n\n### Response \nThere should not be any sales tax since both pans and laders are considered as household items and not luxury items.

That's another 300 ( 20 team members in two sets of team members) sets, or 700 sets in total. That leaves $300 - 700 = -300 $ left to distribute to whoever is left. But that leaves 300 sets to distribute to another 1900 players/teams, which is 10 -3 sets of laces for each player (and therefore each team).

This quote suggests that Jack does not value his job or his education. If he did, he would be working just as hard to further his education as opposed to going back to school. Also we can think that he got a degree so he could climb the ladder and get a better paying job, which would mean that he did not truly value the education itself.

{"text": "In order to show how the two production companies produce films over the past five years, we would need to find out the percentage of each company that produces films in order to compare their output. In other words,  We would need to find the percentage of production that each company does so that the percentage of the two companies would add up to 100 percent. Given the problem and the fact that each company produces about 220 films in a year, we would need to break it up to find the total for five years. To do this, we would use the total number of movies produced by each company and the length of the periods they each produced the movies in. To find the percentage of movies L&J Productions produce in the first year we multiply the 220 movied produced by them by 1/5 which is.4 or 40%. Similarly, we would find the percentage of moviegoers that Johnny TV makes in the first year we would multiply the 226 movies produced by him by 1/5. This gives us a result of.4 which as before is.4 or 40% of the movies that he produces in the first period. To find the other percentages, we need to use the same 1/5 ratio for the other years and use the previous years results. This is done since all the percentages add up to 1.\n\n\n### Input- The best kind of pet for any child, is not just a dog, but a cat.\n### Response: The first line of the question is a statement while the second line of the question are both statements.\n\n### The Best Kind Of Pet For Any Child\nThe best kind of pet for a child is a dog,  because they are able to do many things like play with children, help with homework and guard a house.

He is trying to figure out what values go into r. C is a constant. Jim also knows that p = 3.142. Jim wants to use p and r in a math formula for the circle's area.\n\n### Response2:\nTo determine the area of a Circle, you are asked to know the radius first. Since r = C * p which is a constant, the equation r = pi * C. Knowing that r = C * pi gives us C. Once you know the C, then you can then plug in the pi for r. Thus the equation C^2 = 3.122 so that the formula for the area is C^2 * pi\n\n### Input3:Fred is 17 years old. His father, who is an English professor, wants the average class size for a full-credit class at a major university. Fred's father is curious if students are 17 years old, how many class sections would there be? He believes the answer is 20 sections. Fred thinks there must be more sections.\n\n### Respose3:\nFred's father may be incorrect, in reality for a full-time student, there would be an average of 22 sections. We can assume a full time student has 16 credits. We use the formula for an average when we divide a total amount by the known number. So for 16 credits, the average classes would be 16 divided by 2= 8. Then we want these numbers to be averaged so we divide the total full time class classes by 8. So all of this would take the formula Total number of classes/ Averaged number of classes or 511/8 = 64.75 average class size.\n\n### Final Input:\nHouseholds tend to throw away a lot of waste.

After some consideration and experiments, we prepare to present our findings and conclusions. These take the form of scientific papers and sometimes, letters. The written form is more permanent than speaking \u2013 which could mean we\u2019re writing this as evidence for our future selves.\n\nWriting scientific documents can be very intimidating, especially if it\u2019s not your forte. But there are many strategies for writing that make the task easier. Let\u2019s take a look at the fundamentals.\n\nTo start, you need to know [how to structure](https://github.com/\"sci205/Assignments/blob/master/Lab/assignments/lab-03.md#structure-paper-for-a-lab-report). We\u2019ll see how structure is important when writing, then you\u2019ll practise some by writing your own lab report.\n\n### Assignment: Write a lab report\n## Requirements:\n* You get a lab report template here to follow.\n* Write a lab report that follows scientific conventions and your report outline.\n* Answer questions in the template.\n* Follow your instructions in your template to create a table and a figure.\n\n## Assignment Details\n### Task:\n1.

{"text": "The tote was at first twice as heavy as Kevin's briefcase when the latter was empty. Since, it became twice as heavy as the latter when Kevin put his laptop and work papers, then Kevin's computer must weigh less than that, otherwise how can someone double a weight?. So, it is reasonable to assume that the laptop bag can be estimated around 8-6 = 2 pounds for Karen's.\n\n### Output\n### 1. We have shown that the total weight of the two bags are equivalent.\n### 2. Since Karen\u2019s bag weighs twice as much as Kevin\u2019s, Kevin\u2019s laptop must weigh less than 8 pounds. Thus, the laptop must weigh 2 pounds or less. Therefore, the difference between the two bags must be 6 pounds or more.\n\n### 3.

However, if a second batch was examined it was found that the flaw was not present in that batch. The company believed that the process of manufacture was different in the batch that contained no errors and that the other process was the source of the errors. In order to test the hypothesis, four batches were randomly chosen from the original two groups. A flaw occurred in two of the batches but it did not occur in any of the other batches.

Thirdly, Google Maps will show other routes that are the same distance and time. These routes can give the user an idea of traffic. Lastly, Google Maps can give the user an estimate of the time it will take to drive from one location to the other. The estimates are based on information such as: the traffic on the highway, weather, and public transit. Users can also select an option to give them real-time information which changes the route. This feature tells the user there is an accident on one of the routes, and if there are new alternate routes with less traffic.

{"text": "#### Demonstration: 780\n#### Explanation:\nLet *P and R be positive integers such that P > R, and *B the number of acorns the squirrels collected. Then let *S be the number of additional acorns each squirrel needs and assume all squirrels have already collected P acorns. Now, if you know *P and *R, then you can simply find *S with the formula *S = B + (R-B)/P. \n\n#### Step 1:\nWe can see that there are several numbers to solve for, namely *S, P, R, and B. This means there are several cases to solve. Let the first number P be the squirrels' total acorns. If we assume *P * = R and we divide P into R, we can determine whether the remainder is *P - R (when P is divisible by R) or not (when P isn't divisible by R).\n\n#### Step 2:\nIf P isn't divisble by R, then we have additional *R acorns and each additional squirrel needs 780 more acorns (if R is the total acorns each squre needs).\n\n#### Step1:\nIf P is divisible by *R, then the remainder R is the amount of additional acorns left. Assuming that the first squirrel collected P, we can determine whether or not this is the case for subsequent squirrels (we can easily tell by dividing P by R). If the first squirrel didn't collect P acorns, we need to determine if it collected, and subtract from its total acorns, any additional *R acorn it needed to get R. In this case, the first squirrel needs 339 more acorns and each subsequent squirrel needs *R acorns more.\n\n### Questions:What is the best approach to calculate the answers to these math problems?\n\nIf you were to find a solution for 780, what process would you follow?", "answer": " 15"}

However, while they can be understood through other senses such as touch, aroma, and sight (as in chemistry), the symbols do have their own meanings which can only be learned through practice. Algebra is a very complex subject whose symbols have hidden meanings. Many mathematicians have argued that algebra is a very important and useful skill and that there is no \"one right way\" of interpreting or solving algebra problems. For example, instead of writing a -3x+b= -13 and asking people to think of it as subtracting 3x from an unknown number b, mathematicians could instead write it using an actual physical number like -5x-3= 16.

Because we already know 78 \u00f7 17 = 2. In this example, 78 is the dividend\nand 17 is the divisor. The answer, 2, is the quotient.\n\n--- Example 2: Using Multiplication Operators to combine variables\nInput: 41 * 17 + 23 * 14 \u2013 9 * 12\nOutput:192\n\nIt is important to understand the problem before getting stuck on it or trying to go backwards.

There will be 55 students per room for each science exam.  If one room has students that only take 15 minutes to finish their exam, then what is the maximum number of students that would be able to test in 85 minutes.  Explanation:In this question we are solving for a math problem.  We first have to find the number of rounds that it will take to finish all 600 science exams.  We then must subtract the number of minutes it takes to complete ONE science exam.  This will give us our total testing time needed.  Next, we must divide this total time by 600.  This will give our answer.\nOutput:25\nInput:How much money would a bank earn if it made 6% interest on a loan to a customer and it was left in the account for 5 years?\nOutput:\nInput:A class group of students had decided to go to a concert.

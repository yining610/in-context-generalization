The user of this method needs to pass the parameter n for which the method will extract the users.\n### Explain yourself:\nThe method `getUsers` simply gives you a tuple containing the names and the ages of the users with the passed parameter n. This is why `names` is the tuple containing the names of users, and `age` contains the age of users.

{"text": "Peter's total expense is $.25 \u00d7.5 = $.125\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. The question asks how many ounces of Pepsi he buys based on the facts that he spent a total of $2.00 and brought $.50 of change back with him.\n2. According to the wording of the question, he bought a whole number of ounces (since it said he left with \"$.50\" instead of some fraction)\n3. To find the number of ounces he bought, it is necessary to understand the units of measure and how the costs relate to those units. There is a one-to-one relationship between the cost and the amount of soda he purchased, so we can find the number of 1.25 ounces he bought.\n4. Let's use a table to demonstrate the math. There are 13 different possible amounts he could have spent on soda, and correspondingly 13 different amounts of ounces he could have bought. The possible amounts of soda he could have bought in increments of.5 (.5,.75, 1.25, 1.75 and 2.25) with the accompanying.5 cents to represent a decimal amount are 81.25, -25, 41.25 and 90.25.\n5. If he spent anywhere from $1 to $2, he would have spent an increments of $.75, -$.25, $.50 and -$1.75.\n6. The result could be.5 or -.75 ounces, or 81.2 and 81 ounces respectively.\n7. We also know that there is a definite number of ounces, since the amount Peter spends is not a fraction.\n8. In conclusion, Peter bought 82 ounces of Pepsic.\nAnswer:.5", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Let's take into account the given information. Firstly, it stated that there were 148 lion cubs after 1 year. This means we start with 191 lion cubs.\n\n### Secondly, from the question, it can be inferred that there were more than 191 lions in Londolzi after 1 year. To understand the total number of lions at first, we'll do some calculation. Lets assume the total number of lion cubs born (191) before they die (each month it's 1 less)\n\n### The number of lion cub born + the number of lions die\n\n### Therefore, the number of lion cub which die should be the number of lion which survived until its first year. The formula is\n\n### The Total number of lion cub (at first) - the number of lion die (each month), the total number of lione at first\n\n### Therefore the number of lion at first should be 191 - 12\n\n### The total number of lions\n\n### Therefore when we look at the response: At first, there are 130 lions living in Londolozi. Because the number of lions born is not equal to the number of lions that die. The question should be what is the ratio between born and death lions at first.\n\n### The question is about the lions at the first year.

{"text": "The answer is \"56.\"\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question specifies that Bobby has 16 toys cars and that the number of cars he'll have next year(in 3 years) is 24. This suggests that 24 was the number 3 years before(which was 16 when Bobby had them).\n\nThe number 24 indicates that in the previous year, Bobby's toy cars increased by 25% from his previous sum, that 16.\n\n16 + 25% = 28.40\n28.40 then becomes 28, because you have to round it down.\n\nIn order to calculate how many toys he will have 3 years from now(the next year), you multiply 28 by 150%.\n28 x 150% = 42\n\nThe number 42 is Bobby's toy car count in the next year(in 1 year) so in 3 years it will be 42 x 2 = 85\n\n85 + 25% in the next year = 100.25\n\nThus, the number of toy cars will be 100. \nThe remaining 2.25 is probably for rounding it down, since the question says it will increase by 50% for every year.\n\n### Answer: 56", "answer": " 54"}

When we were writing the code, we tried to have no error message. We also tried to make the code more logical and more digestible by separating the process into smaller, and more readable/writable modules.

{"text": "The cashier has 1 quarter and a total of 13 nickels. This means that Mark gets to keep 10 nickels and the cashier keeps 3.\n\n### Explanation\n\nThe cashier has a till with $8.05 in it. Based on the information provided, we know that the total change to Mark is $7.00 and that the change to the cashier is $1.05. This means that the total of all the coins is $8.10 ($7.00 + $1.05), leaving the cashier with $8.10 - $8.05 = $0.05. This $0.05 could only be in the form of quarters or dimes.\n\nTo get a closer look at the change that Mark receives, we consider the possibility of one dime and two quarters in the till. In this case, the total change would be $6.05 ($6 + $0.05) and the change to the cnaisser would be $7.00 - $6.05 = $1.05 (= $8.10 + $0.01).\n\nHowever, as we can see, the only thing other than a quarter or dime that the cashier could have is a bunch of nickels. The total cashier change can only be reached by this case of the bunch of nickels scenario.\n\nIn order to figure out how much change is in the form of a bunch of nickels in the till, we set up an equation: $2.05 = $5.10 - [number of nickels in the change from $5.10] ($5.10 = $7.00 + [number of nickels] + [quarter] + [dime]).\n\nThe key insight here is that 2.05=$5.10-[# of nickels]. When we replace the variables to get a more intuitive form, 0.05=$0.10-[n] (this is the intuitive form of 2.05=7.00-[?] or 2.05=(7.00-x)x=x-(0.10*x).\n\nIn this way, we solve for how", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "2. In the first row, we begin with the number 1 as the number of eggs for each adult. Since there are a total of 3 adults in the family, the total number of eggs for adults will be equal to 3x1, which gives us the number of eggs for adult equal to 3.\n3. Now, we can write the number of eggs for the boys as a ratio which is 1/2. \n4. Similarly, the number of girls was equal to the number of boys less 1. So, the number of girls multiplied by 2 was equal to the number eggs for boys.\n5. Therefore, the number of eggs for boys divided by the number of boys was equal to the number girls divided by 2.\n6. Since 6 divided by 2 is 3.\n7. Since the number girls was equal to 7, this implies that the number of boys was 3.\n8. Therefore, we can say that the answer is 3.\n\n### Output:\n3.

{"text": "Janet pays $72,820 total for their wages in one month, comprising $872,500 salary for her six employees and $72,800 payroll taxes (10% of $872,000).\n\nThe answer is in the question; the salaries of the warehouse workers and managers are $15/hour and $20/hour respectively. Janet pays a payroll tax 10% of everyone's salary; this also includes the warehouse workers who receive $15/hour.\n\nTo arrive at the answer, we need to know how much the workers and managers earn. Janet has 6 employees: 5 warehouse workers and 1 manager.\n\nThe warehouse workers' hourly wages are $15. Janet pays them $15 per hour for 25 days, or $15 x 25 days per week = $375.\n\nThe manager's hourly wage is $20. Janet pays him $20 per hour for 20 days, or $20 x 20 days per month = $400.\n\nBy calculating $400 + $15 x 5 = $750, we can see that the manager's salary is $750/20 days = $37.50 per day. This means that the manager makes $37.5/day.\n\nFinally, when Janet pays $72820 + $7280, she is paying $728,000/6 employees = $121,000 per employee.\n\nThis $121,500 saleries per employee is a combination of both warehouse workers' and managers' salaries, which are $15,000 and $21,50, respectively.", "answer": " 22000"}

Running for a longer period of run burns more calories as the body will continue to burn calories even after the exercise has been completed. Moreover, when one runs for a longer duration, the body gets more oxygen, which helps burning more calories.

After 40% off on shoes, 60% of the $36 is $21.8, which is below the total price of shoes. Similarly, after 20% off on dress, 60% below the total price of dress, which is more than 40% off shoes.\nTherefore, the total discounted price of Daniela' purchase is $347.2.\n\n### Answer:A. 40% of 40% is 16%, which can be written as.4% \u00d7.4% =.016 or.16% on one line.\nThe total discount is 40% \u00f7 40%. Since the expression on the top line is 16, which is a decimal number, you need to multiply the denominator of the fraction by 100 to get a percentage. 40% 40% = 40% \u00d7 40% = (40% \u00f7 (40% \u00d7 100)) \u00d7 100%.

{"text": "To answer the question, we will multiply the time he spends on customer outreach and advertisement posts by 3. Because Bryan works four hours on customer outstretch each day and half of that time on advertisements, he will have spent three hours of customer outstretch and one hour on advertisements, which will ultimately result in him spending three and a half hours or 3.5 hours on marketing posts every day.\n\n### Input for grade math question\n\n### Answer:\n1. If we are asked to multiply two decimal fractions with different denominators (i.e. the number written at the bottom of the fraction), we should multiply each number by itself and then sum the results. This is because the two fractions will eventually become equal to each other after each number is multiplied by itself.\n2. For example: We have two numbers, 1/4 and 1/6. If we multiply each number by itself (i.e. 1/4 x 1/4 and then 1/6 x 1/6), we will have the following result after summing the two products: 1/(4*4) + 1/(6*6) = (3/64) + (1/36) = 37/64.\n3. However, this is incorrect if one or both of the numbers have a denominator of 2 or 3 (i.e. if they are even numbers). This is because when we multiply by each of the numbers, we will end up with an even number.\n4. So if a fraction has a denominator of 3 or 2, we will need to multiply by 2 or 1/6 respectively, before summing the results. \n5. For example: Let's say that we have 2/3 and 1/2, which will result in 2/3 x 2 x 1/6 + 1/2 x 1/12.  After summing the two products, we will have 2 + 2/3 + 1/2  = 5, which is the correct answer.\n6. When asked to multiply two decimal fraction, it is important to check if the denominators are even or odd to determine whether or not to multiply each number by 2 or 2/3.", "answer": " 2"}

The first step is to break down the units as indicated during the first question:\n2. 3 millimeters (mm) is equal to.03 meter, because 1 milliliter (mm) is equal.001 meter.\n3. 6 millimeters (mm), therefore, is.06 meter.\n4. 5 millimeters (mm):.05 meter.\n5. Greg's family experienced 3 mm, 26 mm (26 mm equals.026 meters), and 5 mm (5 mm equals.0050 meters) during the same week that 26 mm (.026 meters) rained at his house.\n6. The next step is to subtract the camping group's rain from his house's rain. But to complete this calculation, we need to subtract each millimeter from the other group's rain. Because each millimeter of camping rain is equal.0003 to one millimeter of Greg's house's rain.\n7.

{"text": "The answer would be based on the relationship between the two amounts of time: sick days and holidays. Mark would have 50 sick days + 50 holidays = 100 days (or days' worth of time in a year). He used sick days, but not all of them, so he has 50 left. The same amount of time remains for his holidays - 50. So, if we divide 100 by 50, we get an answer of 2 days. If each day covers an 5 day work week, Mark has four days (5 5-day weeks = 20 days) of work left with each day being one hour's worth of time. \n\n### Demostraton\nThe relationship between the two numbers is 10 and 10 respectively, which can be written as 10 : 10. Considering this relationship, the number on the left of the colon is equal in value to 10. This is equivalent to saying that the left number is multiplied ten times by itself, and the sum of this product comes out to a number equaling 10. The left-side number is ten while the right is five which multiplied together equals 50. For example, 2 x 10 = 20; 10 x 10 =100. From this knowledge, we know then that Mark has 50 remaining days.\n\n### Input\nThe answer for Mark is 2 days. Mark has 10 days' worth of sick time left and 50 days' work time left, which is equivalent to 20 days worth of work left. If each day is five days, Mark has four actual days left to work. A day with 8 hours in it multiplied by 4 gives us 32 hours of work left. From this, we can conclude that Mark has 32 hours of time left.\n\n### Rationales\nFor clarification, consider our equation 10 : 5.\nIt can be read as \"5 divided by 5 divided by 1\". 5 over 5 over 1 equals 2.

First, understand the original situation by reading the title and then read this instruction (the instruction is meant to read on its own and you need to come up with the right answer based on the instruction). Now you have an understanding of the original situation but not sure how to proceed because the instruction only provides the part of the solution, while leaving out the key information from the original question and not even the formula used to calculate the result. In this response, there are many assumptions made when reading the instruction. When the original question asks how many hours, a logical thought would be to find out the number of regular hours and then apply overtime.

The number 475 = 14 + 5, so when Stan weighs 475 pounds, Steve and Jim must weigh 164 and 139 pounds respectively.\n\n### Output:\nSince the total weight = 164-139-47+110-0-0, the total weight = ~163 pounds.", "answer": " 319"}

{"text": "Input: If 4 inches rained Monday morning, 2 inches Monday afternoon and 2 inches on Tuesday, and the biggest storm ever was on Friday at 4 inches, then the total rain for the week was 10 inches.\n\n### Input and Rationale:\nChoice: A: 9 inches\nRationales:\n    1. Starting with choice A, Monday morning was 4 inches, then 2 more on the weekday, so the total in just two days was 6 inches.\n    2. Tuesday was equal to the Monday rain and the second day was 2 more, so the total for two days is equal to 8.\n    3. Wednesday had no rain so it is 0 on Wednesday, and Thursday had rain equal to two days, so the Thursday day rain total is 2, then multiplied by two it becomes 4.\n    4. Friday's rain is the biggest, so it is equal to Monday through Thrusday combined so it is 4.\n    5.

{"text": "Because of the information below, the answer choice the writer should pick is A: 128 mph\n\n### Input Details:\nInput: There are currently 114 students enrolled in the school.  Of these students, 57 are male and 57 are female.  In total, there are 230 students at the school who ride the bus.  How many more female students rode the bus than male students?\n\n### Rationale:\nThe answer to this question is Option A. By considering the information that we have been given, we will answer the question \"How many more female students rode on the bus than male students?\" \nThe answer will be Option A: 11. In the statement below, we will show that Option A is the best response.\n### To do this, we will take the given statement and put it into an equation.  To do this, we subtract:\n### (57) - male students from (114) - total students to get the difference, 57 - 57 or 0.  Then, we will subtract the total number of male students who did not ride the bus (57) from the total number of male & female students who did ride (118).  This yields 118-57 = 61.  Now we plug in 118 - 57 into 57 + 61 to conclude:\n57 + 60 = 116. 60 -116 leaves 11 female students who did not ride.\nNext, we will subtract this number from the total who rode the bus (119) to find the difference.  Then, we subtract this amount from the total number of people who rode (119) and we arrive at the answer of 114 - 11 = 103.  If we were to add the option D 105, we would be adding 3 female students who did not take the bus.  This would increase our answer of 103 by 3.  We would have this answer: 103 + 3 = 106.\nThis proves that Option D is not correct as it would include a total of 3 more female students who rode and there would be 3 fewer male students.

This time, Sam divided his $100 by the 3 people, giving each a share of $100.\n\n### Conclusion: Sam, gave his cousins a 2:1: 6 ratio, respectively.\n$600 - $200 = $ 400\n400/ 3 =  $133 per cousin.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": "|Input: Jamal bought 4 half a dozen colored crayons which were priced at $2 each. What is the total of the crayons?|\n\n### Instructions:  The question asks for the total price of Jamal's crayons.\n\n### Initial Thoughts:\nA rational way to approach the problem is to list out all the possible crayon orders and find the total cost, since a crayon is an item.\n\n### Example: If we had 30 crayons; we could buy 15 at $2 each or 20 at $1.50. If we have 30 crayon orders, then we are looking at 60 orders with 15 at $1.5 and 45 at $2.\n\nFor example, if we get 30 at $2 per cayon, it will be $60.\n\nTherefore, we can see that 60 orders will cost $60.\nAs a result, we can write the cost of 60 crayons as the expected order in the following manner:\n\n0 crayons: $0.00\n\n15 crayons at $1.5 each: $22.50\n\n20 crayons at $0.005 each: $10.00", "answer": " 48"}

How many customers bought at least two pens?\n\n### Answer\nTheir store sold $5 pens for a month and a year. They also have a set of pennies. If they sell over 161, 000 pens in one year, then they sell more than 20, 000 sets of pens.

{"text": "Because this question asks about the remaining meals, it is clear that we need to add the number of meals requiring neither vegan nor kosher diets to the 15 meals remaining once we have found that number for meals requiring vegan diets and meals requiring kosher diets. That number, in this case is 3, since 7+8+3=18, which is less than 30. Therefore, Megan must deliver a total of 9 meals in this scenario, 3,9.

The first sentence states that Megan delivers vegan meals. This sentence, in this case, is truthy as it contains a subject (vegan) with a verb (delivers). The second sentence states that Megan doesn't know how many kosher or vegan meals she delivers. This sentence is falsy in that it doesn't contain a subject or a verb. The third sentence states that Megan delivered 15 vegan meals. Again, this is truthy as it states that Megan did in fact deliver 15 meals and it is an accurate statement. The fourth sentence states that Megan needs to make 7 vegan meals. Is that true or false? To answer this question, we should imagine that Megan is standing in front of us, ready to hand us our meal, and she is facing us.

(B) It follows the path of the sun which always rises in the east and sets in the west. (C) It wants to keep its muscles exercised. (D) It wants to eat seeds and worms along its path. (E) The weather outside the nest is the same as the inside.\n\n### Response\nWe can start by discounting choices (A) and (D) since they refer to a single specific action of flying and they aren't generalizable to what a bird does.\n\nThen, we can discount choice (C) because it is more of a general explanation of why birds are active such as flying, walking, and eating, which is too broad to be specific.\n\nLastly, choice (E) isn't relevant to flying because it mentions the weather outside the nest instead of something about the flight path itself.\n\nTherefore, the answer is choice (B): 'It follows the path of the Sun which always rises in east and sets in the West'.\n\n#### Input:\nInput: When would you be least likely to visit a convenience store?

{"text": "The job that can cost you the most is fixing one toilet and two showers, because it takes the longest and therefore costs the most.\n### Rationale:The job with the lowest cost is fixing \"three sinks at an apex.\" The first toilet, second sink, and third toilet will cost $100. The last sink would cost $15, which means $115 in total. When total cost is divided by number of sinks, it yields the cost per each sink. Each sink costs $115 divided by 3, which is $35 each. So, the plumber who can fix the most sinks with the lowest price is fixing three sinks. \n### Rationale 2:The second job costs the most because it takes the longest, while also requiring some added expense. That is, fixing five sinks and two toilets at the apartment complex will take the longest (because it requires fixing more than three sinks), and each shower costs $50, so each sink costs $75. Thus, we have $125 (two sinks and two toiles) divided by a sink, giving us a total cost of $62.50, or $31.25 per sink. \n### Conclusion:The first job is cheaper than the third job.

{"text": "100\n\n### Rationales:\n* **Step 1: Consider the question.** Here, we realize that we need to calculate the number of animals remaining by using the information about the number of birds before, and after, some are freed and have flown away.\n\n* **Step 2: Determine the number of birds that were freed.** There are 6 more white birds and 40 grey ones in the cage, indicating that there are 26 birds in the cage when it is empty before the first set of birds fly away.\n\n* Next, we need to determine the number of birds who have flown away. We can calculate this by subtracting the number of birds 6 more white birds from 6 more white birds, since all white birds are going to fly away. This means that 32 birds fly away after 10 minutes and are therefore not in the cage.\n\n* Since we know there are 40 grey birds in the cages, we can subtract 32, which takes us to 28. So, there are 40 birds in the cage after the first 10 minutes.\n\n* **Final thoughts**. The second half of the sentence gives us important information about how many birds are flying away. We need to take this information into account when working out the final number of birds remaining. If birds are freed throughout the ten minutes, we don't account for them until they are freed at the end of that ten minutes.

Choices:  A. 7 squares B. 3 squares C. 4 squares D. 6 squares E. 9 squares F. 12 squares\n\nRationales:\n1. The question asks how many squares would add up to make 140.\n2. We start by eliminating options that don\u2019t make sense or follow the given information. We cross out \u201cA: 7 squares\u201d because it\u2019s not possible for 7 squares to add up to 240. We cross out \u201cC: 4 squares\u201d and \u201cE: 9 squares\u201d because none of them is divisible by 10.\n\n3.We can therefore cross out \u201cB: 3 squares\u201d because none of the squares in this option is divisible by 5.\n\n4. We can cross out \u201cD: 6 squares\u201d because it doesn\u2019t make sense since we are dealing with divisible by 14.\n\n5. In summary, we know it is either a multiple of 5 or a multiple of 10 or a multiple of 4 or a multiple of 6. This explains why we cross out D: 6 squares because it\u2019s a multiple of 6 while we cross out A:7 squares and E: 9 squares because they are multiples of 5 and 10 respectively.\n\n6. Since there\u2019s no mathematical operation for a multiple to end up as a multiple of another multiple, we know that it is a multiple of 4 and a multiple of 6 or a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 14.\n7.

{"text": "There are two groups of people, two groups of men and three groups of women. Total number of people: 7. Each group has its own number of apples, so the total number of apples sold is 7 x 7 = 49. To calculate the numbers of apples bought by different groups, we can use this formula: 7 - (5 x (2 - 1 - 2 x 1)) = 5 - (10 - 20) = 1 x 3 = 3 apples. This shows that both groups of men bought 30 appels, and each group of women bought 1 apple less than the other group, which means one group bought 29 apples and the other group bought 28 apples. Now, to answer the question properly, we need to multiply these numbers by two, because two groups of men and one group of women were involved.

{"text": "Answer: Marion received 60 turtles and Martha received 43 turtles.\n\n### Rationale:\nTo answer the question, we must use the information given to calculate and deduce possible outcomes. We can do this by applying basic math.\n\nFirst, we know that Marion received 20 turtles more than Martha. This means she received `60 - 43 = 17` turtles more than her friend.\n\nSecond, we know that Martha received 60 tunnels. So, we can deduce that since Marion got 17 more tunnels than Martha, Marion must have received a total of `60 + 17 = 77` tunnels.\n\nTo find out how many tunnels they both received, our last step is to subtract Martha's total from the total Marion received.\n\nSo, `77 - 43 =  34` tunnels, is the number Martha and Marion received together.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe answer is `34`.", "answer": " 100"}

E: 120 dollars\n```\n\n### Why it takes this structure:\n\nDue to the fact that the answer that is provided could either be an integer or a floating number that is in an order of magnitude of a dollar figure, then the answer must have an integer or a floating value of a number that is of an order of magnitude of the dollar value. So, for this task, the answer cannot be $380, the only integer within an order of magnitude of $380 would be $3 as the number 3 falls in the range of 360 to 480 which is an order of magnitude of two to three. But $3 does not qualify since the income that one collects from the job should always be greater or equal to one's tax deduction. Another option for a value that is within the order of magnitude of $420 would be $120 which also does not qualify since it is an integer, and one should always have an income amount that is greater than the tax that one deducts from their income. But, another option that is the best guess that would fit the question is $440. There is a reason why $440 is the best guess since the question asks us to find out what is the total earning, the question also asked us to find out what 10 stone statuess that one can craft and what does a wooden statue cost. $12 in total is paid as tax, and hence one should be able to get at least $360. The question also asks us to find out how much is Theodore's total earning every month, and hence the answer that is provided should be in terms of how much money does a person earn. From the above considerations, the answer is $440 which represents the total earning that Theodore would earn because $440 is within the order of an integer of $320 which is what one may deduct in taxes and is not a negative value. It is also not a positive value since the total earnings that Theodore earns should not exceed what he deducts for taxes.", "answer": " 270"}

{"text": "Susannah swam 3 more times than Camden.\n\n### Logic: \n1. In order to divide the number of times they used swimming times, you can't just divide the number of times as it will still not get into equal division. \n2. To get equal division, you can divide their times as follows: the number of days in a month(31) divided by the number of swims.\n3. In this case: March has 31 days and Camden went on 16 times and Susannah went on 24 times(4 more times).\n4. The division would get: 31 divided by 16 is 2. Look it again and compare with 31 divided by(4+1)=3+1. \n5. So, Susannah went 3+1=4 more times than Camden did and also 4:1=2. So, Susannath went in in 2 more times than camden.\n\n#### Rationale\nThe correct answer is choice B. After analyzing the choices given, it becomes clear that choice B is the only answer that fulfills all the required criteria and makes sense based on the context and information provided.\n- The correct answer should be a simple one that provides a direct answer to the initial question. A complex or convoluted answer should be avoided as it may confuse the audience or lead to a misunderstanding about the answer. A simple answer leaves little room for the possibility of misinterpretation or confusion and can allow for a clear understanding of the given information.\n- As a general rule of thumb, simpler is better for answering basic math questions. Choose answers that are simple and to the point, and don't get too technical.\n- Use of numbers should be avoided, as they can sometimes be confusing or lead to inaccuracies, especially if they are too large or use of decimal points or exponents are used.\n- Choice B: 24/28 - 16/24 is equal to 2. So, Susanna went 2 more times than Camden who went in 4 more times than Camdon did. Using algebra notation a/b -c/d is equal to a - b+ c -d where b and d have an easy computation method.

The amount of peanut butter-flavored cookies made from the buttermilk was.02 kg (1/5 kg). And the amount of sugar cookies made was 0.06 kg (1/3).\n* Therefore, the total amount of buttermilk used for the cookies was.09 kg.\n\n### Once the buttermilk amounts are calculated for each type of cookies, we can use those to see how much buttermilk is left in the beginning.\n\n### To find the amount of buttermilking remaining after making the cookies, we combine all three elements.

The initial day is January 1st, as stated in the questions.\n2. On the first day, we need to \"write 1,2, and 3\" to fill out the first column. The second column contains the phrase \"I will pay my billing\". To summarize, the 2nd and 3rd columns are related, with the second column serving as instructions for the third column.\n3. After filling in the first two columns, we can move onto the second day, as instructed by the instructions. We'll start from the third column. On the first line, there is a \"2\" which is followed by the phrase \"I will...\", which gives us the answer to fill in \"I will do housework\"\n4. On the second line, there is a sentence consisting of 4 lines, with the words \"Write 1, 2, and 3...\" on the very first line. This can be interpreted as an additional instruction which guides us to continue writing the pattern on the fourth day.\n5. In the 1st column, the 2nd day is 2: I will do housework as explained before. \n6. In the 2nd column, the 2rd day is 2: Write your name.\n7.

{"text": "A total of 7 washing loads are necessary because 4 people share 7 days before each getting a new towel, and each person uses an oversized beach towe per day for 7 days.\n\n### Explanation of Response: The first step was determining the question.  I knew that 3 families of 4 were sharing a vacation rental and that everyone uses 1 oversize beach towel per day and gets a new one.  Then I determined how many towels that was.  The question then required identifying the washing load per each person (1 towel per person per day, or 5-6 towels per person per week).  After that, I understood that each person on a three-day vacation could do it the entire time, and every person would have 5-6 towel to wash.  Since the vacation is 7 days, that means every person gets one of their towels cleaned between 2 and 3 times.  That means 14 extra towels in the washing machine.  It was then the case of identifying the most towels in one load, which was answered in the previous paragraph by the 14 extra towel in the machine.  Lastly, I figured out that there were 3 families of 5, or 15 people.  There were 7 days, each day had 3 people going, and each person used 15 towels per week.", "answer": " 6"}

This is what would be represented by the number 2 in the question above.\n### So the solution would be a doubled up square cut into 2 separate pieces that are then divided by half.

{"text": "We can use a mathematical formula on this question to determine the answer.\nUsing the formula A = n!/((m - n)!m!n!), where n is equal to the number of items, m is equal to the number that each person takes, and the \"!\" sign represents factorial, we can find the number of leftover dinner rolls.\n\n### Explaining Answer:When we put this formula into action, we have an easier time determining the answer.\nWe know that there are 16 people. We also know that each person takes 1.5 dinner rolls each, and each person eats 0.5 dinner rolls.\n1. We solve for n (the number of items): n = 16 people\n2. We substitute n for our number of items and solve for A, which is the number of items we have over:\nA = (n!/((m - n!)m!n!)).\n3. In our case, n = 16 therefore A = ([16!/(15 - 16!) 16!15! 16!1/2 rolls].\n4. In this case, the (1) represents the number of people and the (4) represents the number of dinner rolls per person. \n5. The last part is difficult to interpret, but you can break it apart and make it clearer.\n6. The first \"16!\" represents 16 times 16 since the formula uses factorial.\n7. The second \"16\" is the number of people;\n8. The third \"15\" represents a roll divided by the number of people and results in 1.5.\n9. The fourth \"15! 15! 1\" represents 2/16ths which is the number of rolls that each person gets and equals.125.\n10. So, when we take this information and plug it into our formula we get (16!)! 15!.125 - The last 0.125 is the number at the last of the rolls per person.\n11. So, the answer to the question is (.125) =.125. \n\nAnswer: (.125) - 0.12\n\n### Question: What is the greatest", "answer": " 24"}

The choice \"Mathematician\" is incorrect because the woman is not from the South, so calling someone from the South a \"mathematician\" does not make grammatical sense.\n2. \"Calculator\" is also incorrect because calling a person from the South a \"calculator\" is also not accurate or appropriate speech.\n3. Choices \"Average person\" and \"All of the above\" are incorrect because they don't make sense in regards to the sentence. The choices don't make sense because the woman is specifically referred to as \"a woman who just finished first\", which implies that she didn't finish first overall, but within her specific region.

{"text": "Rationale: We can figure out the number of doughnuts each individual will receive by understanding the concept of division. In this case, we can divide 24 by 8, and we get 3 as the answer. This indicates that each individual will receive 3 doughnuts.\n\n### Input (3D problem):Tom has $49, Sarah has $36, and Emily has $52. How much more money does Emily have than Tom has?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We can look at the problem in terms of division which helps us understand that Emily has more money than everybody else. To find out how much more Emily has, we can look at the amount Sarah has.\n2. Since Sarah has $36 and Emily has $32. Divide $36 by $32. We'll get 1.0625 which is more than one.\n3. Divide $49 by $36. We'll get.125 which is less than one.\n4. After dividing $36 by Emily's money, we've answered that Emily has more than Tom. But how much more is she actually taking?\n5. To find the exact answer, you can divide the dollar values as shown above. Emily has about $52.25 for each person having $49.\n\n### Response (3D problem): In this problem, we calculated how much Emily has in comparison to the other two individuals. We divided their money using a division formula that yielded a decimal number. We then simplified that number by rounding it off to see that Emily has more in comparison to her other two peers.\n\n### Rationale: 1. To know the exact difference in numbers, we can use the PEMDAS rule. This involves carrying out the multiplication, addition, subtraction, division, and addition of other rules. However, for this case, we carry out only the rules of division and addition to get the exact answer.\n2. The question of how much Emily has is determined by the formula for division which is \"If we divide one number by another, we will get a decimal numeral called quotient.\" From this, we can say that Tom's money is divided by Emily's and it yields a decimal number.\n3", "answer": " 6"}

This will give us the number of dust particles before and after he swept, which we can then use to solve the question.\n\nRationales:1. We can start by determining the amount of dust particles before he swiped by subtracting 9/10 of the original total from it.\n2. Then we can calculate how many dust particles were left after he swiped by adding 223 to the pre-cleaned dust particles.\n3. With this data, we can answer the original question by dividing the number of dust particles left over by the number of dust particles remaining.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The answer to this question is A: 110.\n2. We know the original dust particles were 331, and the number of dust particles after he swept was 223.\n3. Based on the information provided, we can calculate that the number of dust particles Samuel swept were 9/10.\n4. Using this calculation, the amount of dust particles swept was 299, and after he finished sweeping, 32 dust particles remained.\n5.

{"text": "The cost of each large tub is $6, the cost of each small tub is $2 because each small tub represents two-sixths of the cost of each large tub. Therefore, the cost of each is $2.\n\n### Justify:Rationales: \n1. Alison bought some storage tub.\n2. She bought 3 in large and 6 small. They all cost $48.\n3. Large cost is $6. This is 6/6=1.\n4. Therefore small cost is 2/6=2. Thereby the cost of each small is $2.\n5. The rational part in this answer justifies the question by saying that 6/6 is 1. This means that 6/6 could represent a cost of $6. The rational part of the answer shows how 6/6 represents 1, which is the cost of a large tub. Therefore, 2/6 would mean 2/6 is 1/3 of the cost of a large, which is $2. Accordingly, the small tub will cost $2, as stated in the answer.\n\n### Output:\nIn this instruction we ask a question \"If there are 23 children in a kindergarten, how many times does 8 go into this number?\"\n\nIn this kindergarten, 8 goes into the number 23.\nHow many times?\nThe answer is:\n(6 x 8 = 48)\n\\-\n(23 = 48 \\/ 2)\n\n### Instructions: In this task we are going to be asking a question.\n\nInput: \n* 23 children are in a kindergarten\n\nWhat is the value 8 goes into this number?\n\nInput: 23 children are on a kindergarten.

{"text": "There are three potential solutions to the problem: (1) 14 boats fit along the river, (2) 8 of the 14 boats must have side-by-side boats, and (3) some boats must race in the middle of the river if the river is at least 62 feet in width.\n\n### Solution 1: (14 boats)\n\nIn option (1), the entire width of a river of 42 feet is used to accommodate boats. Additionally, each boat must have a minimum of 2 feet of clearance either side of the riverbank. Using addition counting principles, we know 14 x 2 = 28. Therefore, each boat has a total capacity of 28. This means that there are 28 boats in total that can fit in the river.\n\n### Proof:\n\nWe can calculate the width of each boat using the following equation:\n\n1. Width of each boat = (42 feet \u2013 2 feet required space)\n2. 40 feet \u2013 (2 feet) = 38 feet\n3. 38 feet \u00f7 3 feet = 12\n\n38 feet \u00f7 divided by\n3 feet = 13\n\nThe following shows 12 \u00f7 shows this is how many feet long a boat can be.\n\n3 feet each boat 38 feet long\n\nNext, we can find the number of boats needed to fit in a space using multiplication:\n\n1.

Since each boat needs to be 2 feet apart, the total number of boats needed in this scenario would be (42 - 2 feet) \u00f7 2 22. We can use the same principle, with", "answer": " 8"}

That, because there are 5 days in a week and 35 workdays in a month, which yields out to work 5.75 hrs a day for 35 days. Next, lets check the math of 9000. Since 35/5 = 7, we know Lance works 1 week. 1 week = 1 month. That, because 35 divided by 30 = 1.5 and Lance's weekly income is $187.5, we can tell he earns $187.

Choice \"A\" is incorrect because if Roger rode one mile both in morning and at evening, then he would've ridden three miles total.  Choice \"B\" is also incorrect because if I add up these choices he would not have ridden 10 miles.  This leaves choices \"C\", \"D\", and \"E\".  Now I have the number from \"one\" I'm looking at the problems to see if they could work together to result in one mile two times.  Which means I would have 2 miles, and then two more miles, and then three more miles which would leave 4 miles.  I can also add the numbers 3+3+ 5 which leaves 11.5 which is still not three miles.  My next guess is to go with 2 times to get 5 miles, and then 2 more times for a total of 9 miles.  This makes sense because I multiply two times two to get 4 miles, and then I add 5 miles, and 2 more times I'll get 9 miles.  If I put 4+3+2 it equals 9 miles.  My last option is to do 2 miles, then multiply by 3 to get to 6 miles, then 2 more for 8 miles, and double it.  So if I add these numbers I have 10, which makes sense if I have two and double it to get 4 then I would be at 10.

{"text": "Andy harvested 136 tomatoes from 129 plants. He then dried half of the tomatoes and turned a third of the remainder to marinara sauce. Andy is left with 124 tomatoes.\n\n### Reason:In the problem above, one may find themselves in a question to determine a number that can be expressed as the difference between a sum and a product. That is, they want to determine a number which is the difference between a sum (total number of tomatoes harvested) and a product (combination of dried and sauced tomatoes).\n\n### Rational for Response:In the problem above there are a total of 18 different plants. Andy harvests all 18 plants and finds a sum of a total of 136 tomato harvests. He then dries half of the tomato harvests which makes 68, and creates 47 marinara sauces. He is left with 136 - 68 + 47 = 124 tomato.\n\nThe response above contains a sentence that includes an instruction asking you to write a response, similar to an explanation or demonstration.\n\n### Rationale:In the context of the question below, \"Andy harvests a total of 129 tomatoes\" refers to the total number of tomatoes harvest, which doesn't include the tomatoes harvested from the 18 plants. \"He dries half the tomato harvesto which makes 68\", the sentence also indicates that he did not harvest any tomatoes from other plants, it refers to the one he harvested from the other plants.", "answer": " 42"}

It's between 2*20-40 and the difference is 20-20 = 0\n\nTracy drives 200 miles more than Kati and Kati (who we know is driving 100 miles = 40 miles each to her traveling partners).\n\nWe can therefore conclude that Michelle drives 400 miles total and it's equal to  2Tracy - 3Kati.\n\nWe know that 'Tracy' (2Tracy-3Kati) + 'Kati' = Total miles. Total miles is equal to 1000 and it's equal 3Tracy - 2Kati\n\n2Tracy -3Kati is equal to 400 miles.\n\nWe need to identify who drives more so we can determine how many miles each travel companion drives.\nMichelle drives 100 miles more than Tara, who drives 200 more than Kati (3*80) and so Michelle drives 380 miles more than Kaiti or 200 more Tara.\nThis is equal to 480-200 = 280 miles.\n\nSo, Michelle drives 4", "answer": " 294"}

Considering that Angelina is 4 years OLDER than Justin is now, we cannot expect Angelina to be 36 years old by that time.\n2. If she were 36 years old in 5 years, Angelain would have been 21 years old when Justin was born, which is not true.\n3. Therefore, the only possible choice that makes sense is F: A good Samaritan. A good Samaritan would not make bad luck happen, nor lightning strike, nor would they cause an accident.

{"text": "The correct answer is: 111kg.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question is asking how many kg of potatoes were sold in a day. \n\n1. According to the question, 29 bags (each weighing 7 kg) were sold in the morning.\n2. We know that a total of 17 bags (each wearing 7 kg) were also sold in the afternoon.\n3. The answer can be obtained by dividing the number of bags sold in the morning to the afternoon.\n4. In this case, we divide the 29 bags sold in the Moring to the 17 bags sold in the afternoon (29:17).\n5. After dividing these bags into the number of bags in the afternoon, we will obtain the value of the remainder (29:1).\n6. 29:1 = 29/1 = 29.\n7. It is a remainder, indicating that we have a remainder of 29. This indicates the total number of kilograms of potato.\n8. Let's solve 29:17 by dividing 29 to 17 (29:1) and (29*17)/17.\n9. 29: 17 = 29:1. This is the remainder we already have and dividing it again will yield the same value.\n10. 29*17 = 203. We multiply 29 to 203 and get 577. We don't need this value because it does not meet our target answer.\n11. 29/17 = 73. We can divide 29 to 73 and get 0.0.416 which is the calculated value of 7kg of potatoes for each bag sold.\n\n12. We can find the answer by performing the simple mathematics above: 29:1 is the remainder. The total 29 kg is divided into 17 kg which means there are 12 kilograms of potatos sold for each bag, since there are 29 bags.\n13. After performing these calculations, the answer is 111 kg of potatos sold.", "answer": " 322"}

{"text": "Input: How many more inches are there on the perimeter than on each side?\n\n### Answer: A: 5\n\n### Rationale: In the question, there are two given numbers: the width (4 in) and perimeter (30 in). We know that the width is four inches, and we want to determine the perimeter. We can divide forty by four to get ten perimeter units. If we apply a ratio of ten perimeter units divided by four, the area is sixteen square inches. The area of a rectangle is given by A = l*w = 4*10 = 40 square inches. Since there are ten perimeter units divided into four sides, there are five more inches on the perimeter than each side. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 40 square inches with a perimeter of 30 inches, which gives an area of 196 square inches.\n\n#### Input: 1.What type of food could you get by choosing a letter from the alphabets?

{"text": "Clover travels 1.5 miles in the morning and evening, totaling 30 days of 1.5-miles per day = 2 miles / day.\nAnswer: 2 miles\n\n### Input : What was the largest animal to ever exist?\n\n### Demonication:\n\nThe largest animal to ever lived and existed is the blue whale, as measured by average weight. As per the Guinness World Record, these majestic mammals can measure up to 100 ft in length and weigh up to 200 tons, more than 20 times heavier than even the most impressive elephant.\n\nTo put it into perspective, a typical blue whale would be almost the size of 2,000 giraffes and more than twice the size of the biggest dinosaur skeletons found to date.\n\nOn average, the blue whale is about 80 feet and 175 tons. The biggest specimen measured is about 27 tons more, or 200 tons and 116 feet. The largest whale ever recorded was also the biggest animal that ever existed measuring at 32 meters (105 ft) or more and weighed 394 tons more.\n\nWhile these giant marine mammals weigh far less than most elephants, which can grow at 20 tons.\n\nThe blue whale had a relatively big brain (about 750ml) and a heart muscle (750kg), a complex cardiovascular system. In the brain, they also have very complex and efficient senses that include hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell.\n\nScientists still lack information about the social life of whales. They are thought to live alone, however, there are some exceptions. For instance, groups of more than 1000 blue whales have been seen in certain parts of the world.\n\nThe blue mammals have only one calf, usually about 800kg or more than nine tons. Although the exact gestation period is not quite clear, scientists believe the gestation period for a blue whale is about a year.\n\nThe blue color of the whales is linked to the deepness of the sea.

This gives you the number of toothpick \"sticks\" each card uses (75/52), which can be seen as 1.4759 sticks per card.\n-For the remaining playing cards, Eugene used 200+16, or 216, which equates to over 3.862 sticks per card (216/52), which is greater than 1.47 so he must have used cards containing more than one stick per card.\n-Multiply 450 to get 216 sticks in a box of toothpick so he must have used 11 boxes in total, meaning it took 11*450, or 5000 toothpicks in total.\n### Rationale:To understand further, a toothpick is considered 1 sticks and it is a part of a deck of playing card used to create a house so 75 toothpick is equal to 75 sticks of toothpick and 52 cards are the deck of playing card where 75 tooth pick is used therefore if Eugene use all the card but not used 16 and if we divide 16 from 52 so we have 52-16=36 so divided one toothpick to 9 sticks and if we multiply 1 sticks as 450 so 5000 Toothpick is equal to using 11 deck of playing card but Eugene use all but 16.

Explain or demonstrate how you made these inferences.\n\n\nKylie made 43 beads to make necklaces on Monday. Since 43 is divisible by 2, then she made 21 beads for necklaces. 21 is half of 43 then means Kylie needed the other half for her bracelets and earrings. \nIn the same way, Kylie did 2nd day. Then on the 3rd day she needed 36 beads to make bracelets out of 48 beads. \nSo, the total number of beads the girl gets 92. \nI can see from above that she used 18 beads for one earring and this is why she used 92 beads in total making of the jewelry for each day.\nNow I understand why the total made 96.\n\nHow did your response show that you're able demonstrate the logical connections between and among math concepts?

{"text": "Rick has a total of 130 cards and he initially decided to only keep 35 cards for himself. From there, he has 95 cards left and so he divided them among Miguel, his 8 friends, and his 2 sisters, each of whom received 30, 24, and 21 cards, respectively.\nFrom there, you arrive at 35 + (95/3) + 30 = 126.5 cards Rick gave to Miguel, which rounds up to 127.\n\n### Features:\n* There were two steps to solving this question:\n1. To solve the question, you need to evaluate Rick's card distribution, and this can be done by following these steps:\n  1. 15 + (95x5) + 94 + (95x3)/101 = (94(95x3))/101\n  2. 15 + 5x95 = (5x95)x3\n  3. 15 +? = 175\n1.

{"text": "The correct answer is B: 14 pounds.\n\n### Rationale:The question asks how much a box of goodies weighs, so we must first figure out what a box of goodies consists of before being able to estimate its weight.\n\nUsing the information provided, it can be assumed that the box of goodies consists primarily of three items: jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms.\n\nFirst, let us calculate the weight of jelly beans contained in the original box.\n\nTo calculate the weight of an object, we can use the formula `Weight = (1 lb for 1 oz or 28.3495 grams)`\n\nSubstituting, we get\n\n`Weight = (1 lb) * (14 oz or 1 lb = 28.35 g)`\n\nFrom here, we subtract 8 oz from 14 oz to get 6 oz of jelly beans in the original box. Multiplying 6 oz by 1 lb, we get 6 lbs of jelly beans originally contained in the box.\n\nNext, let us calculate the weights of brownies contained in the box. Substituting, we arrive at\n\n`Weight = 5 lbs of brownies contained in a box\n\nSince we added the weight of 2 lbs of jellybeans to the box, then 2 * 6 = 12 oz of jellybeans have been added to the box. To remove the weights, we have to calculate 2 oz + 2 oz = 4 oz = 1/2 lb = 1/5 lb = 0.2 of a lb. Weight = 1.2 * 1 lb = 1.2 lbs of jellies added in the box\n\nThe number of 2 lbs brownies = 2*5 =10 lbs of brownies in total\n\nThe total weight of the box = 14 lbs\n\nAnswer: \n```\nCourtesy: https://quizizz.com/admin/quizzes/6137340/test-57-grade-8-english-language-arts-answer-key?\n```", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "The question poses a numerical math problem with words in bold that indicates an unknown value, 7/5 for example. After downloading 2100 files, I will explain how to determine the value of 70%.\n\nConsider the 800 files that first needed to be downloaded along with the subsequent process where 3/5 of those files were ultimately deleted.   Since 7/5 is smaller, subtracting the larger quantity from the smaller quantity leaves us with the difference 3/4 of 400. But wait, there was addition that occurred with downloading 400 files in the second round so the difference will now appear as follows:\n 800 - (3/5) 800 = 480 - (3/4)400 = 300 -150 = 150 (7/5)*150 = 3/5 of 150 = 70 % of 150.

{"text": "First and foremost, it is important to calculate the number of students who received a grade below B in Mr. Sanchez's class. To do this, we can use the percentage and the total number of students, where 40% of 60 students is equal to more than 24 students.\n\n### Next, we can use the relationship between multiplication and division to find the number of students who got a grade of B and above. We start by cross out B and above and find the total number of students who got grade B. This is 12 (60% of 20)\n\nLastly, to find the total number of Grade 5  who got a grade of more than B, we divide 12 by 2: the percentage of students in Grade 6 who received a grade B and the percentage of students who received a good grade in general.

Suppose this goldfish is below the surface, let me represent that as \u201cX1\u201d. So, after x counts, we get \u201cy + X1\u201d goldfish. The value of y is such that if we add \u201cX1\u201d to \u201cy\u201d, we get 15.

Thus, we get 25% above the surface + 50% below the surface = 75%. Accordingly, 75% of goldfish above or below the surface we cannot see.\n\nNext, how many goldfish are too deep to be seen by Toby?\nWe know this is equal to 25% of the total goldfish in the pond.

Therefore, the pile had a total of 441 marbles in addition to the 12 marble that were picked out.\n\n### Rationale The question describes randomly picking out 12 marbles from the pile that had 105 marble in it. From the question, you can deduce that the pile has a total of 113 marble after the 12 marbels were randomly picked out. Since the question asks you to count the pink marbles that are left in the pile, you need to deduct the 12 marber that were removed from the question. After deducting the 12 marbel, you can count the remaining pink marbles and the result will come to 42, which is an answer choice.\n\n\n### Demositration:How many marbles in a random pick pile does one have to pull out to obtain 394 when one is starting from a random pick pile that has 125?\n\n### Rationales From the question, it can be deduced that one is starting with 125 marbles and one has to pick them out in order to obtain 395. The question asks you to provide the least number of marbles that one should pull out of the pile in order to achieve the asked number. Since you are provided that the pile has 125 marble, the number of marble that you should pull out to obtain 125 is 230.", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "The answer to the question \"How many unused craytons did Madeline have?\" Is 5/8.\n\n### Explanation:\nMadeline's box had a total of 24 craytons, 8 of which were new and did not have any marks. 5/8(=11%) of the 24(=8) craytons were not used. The second box had a total of no used craytons, but 8 used craytons which means that 4/6 of the craytons(=66%) were used. Madeline then had a total of 11%-66%, which equals 55%.\nThat is 55% of the craytons used, which means that the number of marked/used craytons is 55% * 24. Since there is no more of the total craytons left, this is equivalent to 5/8 of 24 cays.\n\n### Input:\"How many 4-digit numbers are divisible by 3?\"\n\n### Rationales:\nAn answer can be found by looking at the choices available.\n\n  * If you chose the answer with the second answer in place of 29: Then the value of that answer is 9\n  * If you choose the third answer: Then the value of your answer is 9\n\n### Therefore, choose the 2nd answer:\n9\n\nInput:\"What is 112-6?\"\n\n### Response:\"56\"\n\n### Rationale: You just need to look at each choice (answer) to figure out what the response is!\n\nInput: What is 2/3 of 75?\n\n### Rationaels: 1.

The solution to these problems is writing tests using simple strategies like the bubble sort. \n\n### Writing Effective Test Cases\n\nIn this article I will introduce you how we can write test cases with bubble sort. One of the issues that we face when writing test cases is the amount of time that it takes to write each test. We can solve this problem with bubble sort. When deciding what order to use the bubble sort, I will focus on selecting test cases to run. I find selecting test cases to run based on a table very easy to understand and it reduces overall bubble sort time.\n\n**Test Cases for Writing Effective Test Codes**\n\nLet us first define what exactly a test case is.

{"text": "#### Explanation\n\nRationally, we can answer this question by:\n\n* Defining the question and laying out the information. Here, we would define the question, \"How much will be Robi's total savings after 136 weeks? (6 months)\" and lay out the information, \"He started to save $2 at the beginning of each of six months.\"\n\n* Establishing a pattern. Rather than making an assumption on the amount Robi saves for next six months, we can first establish a pattern.\n\nWe can do this by looking at:\n\n* The previous 6 monthly saving amount. We know that \"Each of six months\", he saves $2, $4, $8,..., 384. So, his cumulative saving amount for the first six months is 2 + 4 + 8 +... +384 = 720.\n* The relationship between months and the amount he saves. We can see that the amount he saves increases by 36 each time. If he saves $2 this month, he'll save $4 next time, and the same for the third, forth, fifth, and sixth. He always saves an additional 36 each time his month increases by one.\n\nWe can use this information to make a prediction, and so we have:\n\n\"Robi saves $36 more each time his month increases.\"\n\nSo, we can say that: If Robi saves a total of $i in the first 6 months, then he'll save $36i in the next 6 months. This is a 4th order recursive equation. \n\n#### Solution\n\nWe can solve for the next 6 monthly savings by substituting or plugging the 4th order recursive values into each other. For instance, if Robi's monthly total savings is $115 in the next 6th month, then we plug the $115 into the below equation to get a new monthly total savings of $151. \n\nNext $6 months($36 * $115) = $151.\n\nIf someone makes $151 in the next six months and their monthly total savings was $179 before, a recursive relationship would produce another $151 in", "answer": " 126"}

An argument might be resolved to the satisfaction of everyone involved.\n2. There are multiple aspects to consider when determining the time when an argument will be resolved to everyone'st satisfaction.\n3. The information provided in the question is that an argument is most likely to be resolved when the person making the argument isnow calm and relaxed, and also when the person listening to the argument is also calm and relaxed.\n4. Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that an argument is mostlikely to be resolved to everyone;s satisfaction when both the person making the argument andthe person listening to the argument are calm and relaxed. This is because both sidesofthe argument will feel more comfortable expressing their perspectives and opinions, and bothsides will be more likely to fully understand the points the other individual is making in orderto reach a mutually beneficial resolution.\n5. It is also reasonable to assume that the time at which an argument is most likelyto be resolved is when both parties are relaxed and calm because during these times, it is muchmore likely for people to be in a positive mindset and focused on finding a solutionrather than becoming emotionally charged and engaging in a hostile or negativedialogue.\n6. Ultimately, the answer is D: In a calm and relaxed state.\n7. The answer B: Later in the evening doesn't make logical sense because the time at whicharguments are resolved is a function of the state of mind of both parties.\n8. The argument cannot be resolved if the person making the argument iscalm and relaxed and the person listening to the dispute is not.\n9. Also, the argument cannot be resolved if both parties arenot calm and relaxed and have already made an effort to resolve it without success.\n10. It's also not relevant to say \"later in the evening\" because the time atwhich an argument is most likely resolved to everyone'ss satisfaction isn't determined bywhat time of day it is, but rather the state of mind of the", "answer": " 328"}

So, he was in school for 12 years before he finished his schooling.\n\n### Inputs: Find the average of 5 and 7.\n\n### Response\nThe average of 5 and seven is 6.  We can find the average in two ways.  In the first case, we can find the sum that all the numbers in the set represent.  In this case, the sum of all the numbers in the sets add to 12.  Thus, the average would be 12/5 which gives out the approximate answer of 2.4.  In another case, we can find out the mean.  To find the mean, we would square each number in the set, add up all the squared numbers, and then divide by the sum of the number of numbers.  Thus 2^2+2^2+1^2+1^3+3^2 = 9+9+4+9+12 = 38 + 9 = 47.  Finally, it would equal 47/5 which would be approximately equal to 9.4.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 9.4 because the average would be the same, but the difference in the two approaches would make the difference in answers.\n\n### Notes: The average of 5 and three is six.

Choices: \n\n## Response:The biggest number on any day can be found on a big number and a big day. \n\n## Explanation:\nIt is important to first ascertain the meaning of each word in the question in order to properly understand it. The word \u201cnumber\u201d can either refer to a single digit (such as \u201c5\u201d) or a multiple (such as \u201c50\u201d).\n\nThe phrase \u201con any given day\u201d, can mean two things: 1. the day on which you find the number, or 2. the exact number you find.\n\nTo break this question down further, the question can be re-phrased as: \u201cWhat is the biggest number I can find on any given day?\u201d\n\nThe next step is to identify and eliminate irrelevant choices.  \n\nChoice A: A large wall that could potentially house the number. However, since a large wall is simply an example of a type of construction, it does not satisfy the criteria for the answer. \n\nChoice B: A bank machine. Considering what is described in the question, this cannot be the answer since most bank machines do not show numbers on the screen. \n\nChoice C: A sports scoreboard. This does not answer the question as the largest number is not the scoreboard, but the number on the scoreboard. \n\nChoice D: A billboard. While it is true a billboard could have a large number, considering the context of the question, this does not answer it either.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer would be Choice E: A big number and a big screen.\n\nNow, it would be easy to answer the question without the need for math if the phrase \u201cOn any given day\u201d did not imply \u201cthe exact number\u201d. If the word \u201cnumber\u201d was replaced with \u201cdigit\u201d or \u201cnumeral\u201d in the question, then the correct answer would be A: A large wall.", "answer": " 22"}

If she trains at the boxing gymnasium for 4 times a week (Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Fridays) for 1.5 hrs per training session. So, in a week, she would train for 6 hrs. But then, there are also the strength training parts. If the strength training session lasts an hour, the total strength training hours would be 3 hrs. That means that Kat would spend 6+3=9 hrs at the gym. So, if we add the 9 hours to the 2 hours for strength training we would get 11 hrs of training in one week.\n4. We also have to add in the hours of training for one week. Let\u2019s look and break down the question:\n5. A: 3 times a week for one hour of strength training = 3 hrs\n6.

{"text": "If you are trying to avoid a serious accident, you should consider the 30% chance of skidding on the ice at 32 degrees to be your point of no return.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The percentage chance of skidding is 5%. For every 3 degrees, the percentage chance increases by 5%. At 32 degrees, we would get a 35% chance of skiddin.\n2. If the temperature is less then 32 degrees, the percentage chance of skiddin still equals 5%.\n3. This means that the chance of skiddin at every temperature below 32 degrees is also 5%.\n\n4. At 8 degrees the chance of skidding already is at 30%. This is because, for every time we go 3 degrees lower, the chances increase by 5%.\n\n5. The chance of skidding at every temperature lower then 8 degrees is still 30%.\n\n6. That's why we can say that the percentage chance of skidining at every temperature less then 32 equals 30%.\n7. This means that the percentage chance of being in a serious accident at every temperature lower then or equal too 8 degrees is also 30%.\n8. This means that the probability of being in a serious at at every temperature less then or equal too 11 degrees is also 3o%. This is our point of no return where Annie should not continue to drive the truck.\n\n9. This means that if she drove the truck at 30 degrees, the percentage of a serious accident would be 40%.

Now that we know the answer is not above zero, we can simplify things to get our final answer. \n\n12. The point of no return is when the percentage of a severe accident is equal or above 40%.

While this is possible, it is less likely and should be discarded.\n\\\nOption 2: Using the given scenario, this option may require as little as 630 pounds of pineapple to make 30 pizzas. This is more feasible as pizza makers would try to make do with what they have without wasting any fruit.\n\\\nOption (3): This is the only option in the list that would require a total of 1,6050 pounds of pineapples to make 301 pizzas. This makes the most sense based on the scenario and it is the most likely to be correct answer.\n\nFinal verdict: Answer = 1,6039292\n\n### Input Question:\nYour father decides to paint his", "answer": " 54"}

Consider Anthony:He has 12 cater and 2/3 of them are cats.\nHence we can assume that he has 4/3 catts in total, which translates to 12/3 cats or 4 cats.\n\nNext we would also have 6 dogs.\n\nTotal cats: 12/3 catts + 4 catts = 16/3 cats + 4 cats = 19244 cats\nTotal dogs: 6 + 6 = 666 dogs\nTherefore, 2/3(1923444 cats) is equal to 19234 cats.\nTherefore, we get 2 dogs in total.Hence, total of 4 cats + 6 dogs = 12+6 = 18 animals. \n\n##### Anthony and his friend Leonel decide to adopt pets to stop them being killed.

{"text": "The average number of leaves which fall per hour is 2.31.\n\n### Reasoning: The average number of minutes per hour (60/12 = 5 minutes) x 5 leaves in the first hour => 25 leaves in the first and hour => 25 / 5 = 5 leaves per minute. Now, assume 7 leaves fall in first hour (from the question) and the same number of leaves fall each hour for each remaining hour => 4*1 = 4 leaves, 4*2 = 8 leaves, 4*3 = 12 leaves, 4*4 = 16 leaves, 4*5 = 20 leaves, 4*6 = 24 leaves, and so on. Total number of leaves = 7 + 25 + 35 + 45 + 55 + 65 + 75 > 275. The average number of leaves is 275/8 = 34, then 34/5 = 6.8. Now, we have to round off the decimal and to do it we have to consider the remainder divided by 5. Rounding off numbers to the nearest 5, it works.

How fast did Harry ran?\n\n### Demostration\nHarry ran 10 meters / hour on monday.\n\nFrom tuesday to thusday, he ran 15 meters/hour every day.\n\nthen on friday he went faster than the day before, and that day he ran 18.5 meters/hour.\n\nHarry has a total of 5 runs on different days. The total for the runs = 10 m/h + 15m/h + 18.5 m/h = 43.5m/h\n\nThe total for one day = 5 runs x 43.5 m/h\n\nThe final day runs total per 1 day = 217.5 m/h  \nThe speed for that day(i guess) = 18.5x 2/ 6/15 m/h/day = 18.95x 1/15/5x2 = 18.82\n\n### Question: Harry ran from 30 meters to 50 meters. How long (in seconds) did it take him to complete this journey?\nHarry's total journey in a day = 5 runs = 10m /h + 15 m/h  + 18.8 m/h = 33.8 m/h if we total it up and divide it by 30 = 1 m/s if harry needs 30 seconds to complete it, it means he ran at 1 m/s but he did not do it from (30-1) m, so when we subtract the total speed he needed(30s) then with what he did he ran 50 meters which multiplied by 2 sec", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Tom can make approximately 80 large dough balls if he buys 50-poud bags of flour. These 50 dough balls will weigh around 500 lbs.\n\n### Rationale: Tom wants to make the worlds largest dough ball, so he will need to buy 500 lound s of flour.  Since he can buy a 50 lound bag of flour for $ 20 (50 lound $20) he will have to buy 26 bags of flour (500 pounds of 50 lound $ 20) since he wants to make the world size dough ball.\n\n### He also needs to buy 10 lound of salt which costs $0.20(10 lound $.20). Then, since Tom spent $1000 on promoting, you know that Tom wants to make a lot of money and sell a lot of tickets.  Finally  Tom knows that he will need 500 people to come to his event,and he will charge $20 for each ticket (500 tickets $ 20). Since Tom only wants to make 80 large dought ball, he wants to charge $20..01 for every inch of his dough balls, but he will charge 45$ for a regular sized dough ball ( 80 inch $20.01 for the regular dough ball ).\n\n###  Then, the total amount of money which will be needed to make the worlds lrage dough ball and ticket for 500 is $179.70(500 ticket $ 20 (each) $80 inch dough ball $20)(.01 for every 2 inch of the large dough ball is $169.70) +50.20 (10 pounds of salt $.20). The answer is 230.90.\n\n### Answer: The total amount of money that Tom needs to make one large dough ball and also sell enough tickets for 500, is $179,70, which is 230,90 with 1 decimal.\n\nInput: There seem to an awful lot", "answer": " 8798"}

{"text": "This is a good example of a data-driven question. We need to first calculate the number of people who did not do both the tubing and rafting events. Let's say there was a total of $40$ people. $ 40-10= 30 $ people did not do both the events. In other words, $10$ people did both. Since $10$ people participated in both tubing and raftings excursions, that means more people did tubing than were on the rafting excusion. Also, I think this question requires a bit more clarification since some options may not make any sense for all of the 40 kids. It may only apply to some of the kids or maybe some of the choices are redundant.\n\n### Rationale\nAs mentioned above, $10$ kids did both trips. Therefore, $10*(40%)= 4$ kids did tubing and rafted. (10 * $40\\%$) This means that 10 out of the $40$ kids did the tubing and also rafting events.\n\nAs a total of $10$ kidds rafted, we can infer that the rafting event was more popular than the tubing event. That is because $10$ people joined the rafting event, but only $4$ people joined the tubing event. Therefore, more people joined the raftings excusion than the tubing excusion.\n\nIf it is assumed that any of the 4 options are reasonable, then there will be a 4:3 ratio. That is because 40% of the rafting population and a total of 30% of the 40 children participated in the tubing excursions.\n\nAnswer: \n### Question\nHow many of the kids rafted were also on the tubers for both the tubeing and rafting \n### Answer\nSince we know that there are 40 kids total and 10 kids did both the tubing and the rafting event from the previous question, we know that there are a total of 40 people on the two tours. There are also 10 people who participated in both the tubeing tour and the rafting tour. That means that only", "answer": " 5"}

What are the dimensions of the top and the bases that the carpenter should use?\n\nResponse: A length of 1.9 centimeters for the base\nAn area of 1.2 centimeters for the top\n\nRationales:The dimensions of the top and base should be determined based on the area and perimeter constraints. The top area should be 4.93 centimeters and is required to be larger than the base area of 48.5 millimeters. Consequently, the top area should be 2.2 millimeters larger than the base area. The perimeter of each square should be 23 centimmeters and should be the same for each square. Consequently, the perimeter of each square is 4.6 centimeters. Based on this information, the dimensions of the top would be an area of 4.93 - 0.2 = 4.73 which is equal to 27.3 centimeters (46 cm perimeter for 5 boxes means 9.2 centimeters per box).

{"text": "The ratio of Bob's speed to Jim's speed is 1 to 1.

Let's call them \"faster\" and \"slower\". The question is asking how long it would take for the \"slower\" person to catch up with the \"faster\" person, meaning the faster person would have a 1 mile head start. The total time will only depend on the combined speed, therefore we don't need to think about the actual speeds (6 and 9 miles per hour). As a result, we can determine that the faster person's total miles covered equates to the total distance that would need to be traveled in order to reach him. Hence, we can subtract the head-start distance from the total distance, resulting in the amount of time it would take to travel that distance.

The answer to that would result at $6300 in total expenses for electricity in June.   Answer: 6300\n\n### Instructions:\nA sixty bulb-watt uses 60 Watts of power each hour. If Allyn has forty such bulbs in his residence, determine Allyn's entire month-to-month expenses on electricity if he pays 20 cents every watt made use of.\n\n### Proceed:\nFix:\n\nLet a be every bulb Allyn has in his home.\n\nEnsure that Allyn has forty bulbs.\n\nA = 60 watt = 60 x 0.020 = $1.2 \n\nMultiply $1.2 x 40 bulbs = $48.00 \n\nFix: \n\nLet X= # of bulbs Allyn has in his house.\n\nFind X = 60 (watt-bulbs)\n\nTo obtain Y.\n\nWe should multiply 60 x.20\n\nSo, we obtain: \n\nY. \n\n$12.\n\nNow, we are going to find the value of Z\n\nZ= 4 X Y \n\nZ= 24.\n\nNow, the value of total expenses \n\nT=$12.00 + $24.= $36.00\n\nT= # bulbs Allyn would have. \n\nThe total month-to-month electricity costs are $36.0\n\n### Response Explanation:\n\nThe problem asks to give the total monthly expenses of Allyn on", "answer": " 14400"}

{"text": "$560 \n\n### Rationales for solution:  A blanket has several different measurements. A blanket can be measured from the top of mattress to the bottom of the quilt.  Or a blanket is measured from the side to the side of the length of the blanket, not the top to the bottom.  The quilt is 7 feet by 8 feet, and 8 feet by 8 feet is the same as 8 feet by 7 feet.  Then, you multiply 40 by 7 and 40 by 8 to get the total cost.  To add up the cost, you add 40 by 5 and 40 by one, instead of 40 by 6 and 40. 5 + 40 + 40 +40 = 130 which rounds up to 131. Therefore the answer will be 131 because the 8 foot by 8 foot quilt costs $480 but you must add 40 times the 5 foot by 8 feet + 40 times the one foot by 8 feet which equals 51. 51 plus 130 equal 181 and then add 40 to that = 221. $480 x 221 = 109,680.\n\n### Input 1: If you subtract two days when you add a day.

{"text": "The total number of people at Ashley's birthday party is 258, including Ashley.\n\n### Rationales: \n1.  From the question, we understand that the total number of guests would be 51, which is half the number (20) of guests invited by Ashley.\n2.  Considering each guest to invite only one (1) more person, we now need to think about how many guests each guest will invite. \n3. Since half the total number (51) of guests is 25, it is reasonable to assume that each guest will invite 25 people; in other words, multiply 51 by 2.5.\n4.  After multiplying 51 by 3.5, the total number of people attending Ashley's party would be 176.5.\n5. But since we need the total number of people including Ashley, we need to add 176.25 + 1 = 177.25.\n6.  Hence, the final answer is 177.\n7.  The reason why the total number could have 258 people in it is because Ashley, being the owner of the party, could have invited twice (25).5 guests, not just once.\n8. Thus, in total, the number of people at the birthday party could be 177. \nAshley, being the birthday girl could have invited 1 guest and her other 19 guests could have invited each guest with 2 guests, which will result in 19 + 177 people in total (19 guests x 2 guests each).\n\n### Response\n![Solution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14952500/157642359-f67ed7cb-c4fa-4562-8b6d-cf8d580b4512.JPG)", "answer": " 31"}

If John misses 2 free throws each time he fouled, the probability of him making 70% of the free throws is 70/100 = 79. A game has 5 fouls. Therefore, the calculation is 5 * (100% - (1/2*(79))) = 78.75%, and he gets 79% of the total free throws available, or 19.75% of 78.7. Therefore, he will get 19.7 divided by 100, or 197/ 100 free throws. So, He will get 197 - 78.7 = 118.3. The number of free toss chances is 118. So he will get 28.

She was charged for the electric meter plus an additional amount for the telephone bills including an amount of $45 which she thinks is to cover the electricity consumption. How much was Mary charged for the electric meter?\n\n### Rationales for the first question\n- $55 covers for the electric meter\n- $95 covers for the electricity consumption\n- $45 is for the phone\n- Total cost is $145.\n- The question states Mary received $95 and was charged $45 for the phone\n- $95=145-45\n- Therefore, she needs another $50\n- Constructed response: Mary was charged $45 to cover phone costs so the total of $95 includes phone cost.

As a boat can take 12 seats per trip and a trip occurs 4 times in a day, there are 12 seats for each day and 48 seats in two days; so 48 seats for a trips.\n\n### Response\n### Expansion:\nEach 4 trips can take upto 4 seats and 5 trips can take 7 + 4 seats = 11 seats and 6 trips can take 10 seats.

Randy's friend's rule says that Randy needs to practice for 10,025 hours between his 12th birthday and his 20th birthday. \n\n### Solution\nRandy has 8 years between now and then with 52 weeks in each year. We will work with each year individually rather than adding together all the weeks.\n\n### Hours of practice\n\nHours = 10,030 * 1 = 10,108 (There is 18 extra hours in Randy's practice time versus the friend's rule) - Randy needs to practice every day\n\n### Days of the week\n\nDays = 52 * 7 = 364 (Randy will practice for 7 days per week during the school year)\n\n### Weeks left in the Year\n\nYears = 8 (Randy is 12 years old, which leaves him 8 years until adulthood or graduation)\n\n### Year 1\nRandy works his first year with 364, 1 of the remaining 8, days. He will also take 2 weeks off that year for vacation.\n \n### Year 2\nRandy practices 10,180*1*2 = 20,360 hours in year 2.

He will also work on vacation days.\n\n### Year n\n \n### Vacation Days\n\nAfter adding up and subtracting each year and totaling hours worked, Randy will work with 9,285 remaining hours. He'll have time left to practice for 325 more days, which will be enough to complete the 10,191 hours. If Randy practices 15 hours per day starting with his 12th year to 8th month, he will be finished with the 10", "answer": " 5"}

B: The man was an engineer. C: The man was blind. D: The man was color-blind. E: The man was deaf.\n\nOutput: A: The archaeologists is female.\n\nInput: A woman took a glass with her favorite flower in. When she got home, there was no flower in it.

{"text": "Brian can hold his breath underwater at the end of the week for 50% of the time he could at the start of the week (50/100 =.50).\n\n### Rationale:Let's start by identifying what we're actually measuring: the amount of seconds Brian can hold his breath under water.\n\n### Explanation:We can think of 'holding his breath' as a variable, denoted by 'X'. This can be thought of as representing any continuous variable, such as time or length.\n\n### In this scenario, we want to know how much this variable has changed over time. However, the units of this variable are already given, so it doesn't change 'underwater'. Therefore, we can write the equation like this:\nX = how much time can Brian hold his breath\nt = time (1 week = 1 week, 2 weeks = 2 weeks, etc)\n\n### We can see how the variable X changes overtime.\n\n### How did the variable change from the start to the end?\nFrom the beginning we can think the variable (X) is the unit'seconds'.\n\n### The variable has increased by a factor of 2 after the first week\n\n### Therefore, we can conclude that the variable X has increased by 2 after 1 week\n\n### This variable X has increased another factor of 2 in the second week\n\n### The first week, X is 50.\n\n### The second week, it is 50 + 10 = 60\n\n### The third week, it is 60 + 100 = 160\n\n## Question:Based on a scenario, create new, valid rules/formulas\nInput: If you're out shopping in the morning, how far will you be from home when the sun has hit its highest point?

What is the missing value?\n\n### Demostration:\nIn the task, we are asked to compute 744 students by following the given procedure. However, the question does not specify what the missing value is. To resolve this, we must first identify the values that can be used in the computation and determine what is missing. For example, assume that 7 is not the last value, we can calculate by substituting this value to understand the computation. If 7 were the last value, 144 is the missing value. In the question, we were given a total number of students, 786, with 6 being subtracted.  Then, since the computation involves division (instead of subtraction) by the square root of a value (128), it's reasonable to assume that the value could be a multiple of 128. Finally, we can determine that the resulting amount (744) is 489 multiples of the square root of 744. This indicates that the missing value is 489, as 744 can be divided by the square root of this amount.\n\n### Output:\nThe answer is 489.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe only missing value that we were given is 7; however, this value has been indicated that it should not be the last value and is actually a multiple. Furthermore, we can note that the missing value is an integer and is a multiple of 10 in line 5 of the output. This further indicates that the missing value has to be a multiple of 5 rather than 10. Therefore, the missing value is 25, but the question has been written with 489 and this cannot be corrected.", "answer": " 42"}

And after 2 years, Patrick\u2019s age will be two years more than Robert\u2019s age.\n\n### Input A person is 40% efficient. When a task takes them 8 hours to complete, how many hours would 2 people take to complete the same task?\n### Response:2 person\u2019s efficiency rate is 1/5 that of a single person\u2019s. This means 2 people will complete the task in 4 hours (33% of a single person\u2019 time).\n\n### Input B: You sell a lot of goods at your store. How long time could you keep the lights on without charging a battery?\n### Rationale a: The ratio of the amount of goods you sell to the number of hours you could leave the lights on is 0.1/1 hrs. If we multiply this by 24 we get the number of hours the lights can be left on: 2.4 hrs.\n### Rationale b: The ratio is 0.1 which means if you have 24 lights, you can use the lights for 24 hours straight\n### Input C: How long could you drive your car if the fuel container had an 8% chance of losing the water and the diesel?\n### Rationales a: The car will not be able to drive without water, so all of the fuel must be replaced with drinkable water. The number of times it would take to run out of fuel without water in the tank is 0.9.\n### Rational b: The car only will run out of fuel with the percentage of not having the diesel water.\n### Input D: How many times is it less than the percentage of the number of people that will vote?\n### Analysis: We know the number of people is less by 2 times the percentage of the votes since this is the same as 100x2.", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "The shoes cost $80 ($70 plus $10).\n\n### Justification:\nFirst, we note that Joey will need to earn at least $80 to buy the shoes, as the question states that if Joey earns just that amount, the shoes will be paid for.\n\nNext, we consider the question's scenario and determine the earnings of Joey's lawn mowing, collectible figure sales, and after school job.\n- Lawn mowing: Joey could mow 3 neighbours' lawns for $ 8 per lawn. According to the scenario's information, this would take 10 hours total (3 neighbours times 3 lawns each). Subtract 10 from the original question's 10-hour requirement and we will have the remaining hours needed.\n- Collectible figure sales: Joey could sell 2 collectible figure to his friends for 9 per figure. This results in giving him 18 as the total amount earned if there are two friends that are doing the purchasing.\n- After school job: Joey will be working an after school job for 10-hour per day. This results in an income of 70.\nWe're good to go, so let's add the sums up!\n\n80 = x + 70 + 18\n\nSolving the equation for x, we get: x = +80 - 70 - 18 = 80 - 87 = -7 \nAnswer: -57 \n\n### Input (2):\n\n### Input\nThe first number, 170, is 33 percent more than 130.\n### Demonstattion: If 170 is to 130 as 2 is to, then A: 2 B: 80 C: 20 D: 3 C: 130 D: 450\n\n### Rationale:\n\nTo determine the percent more, multiply the second number ($130$) by 2 and then subtract the product from the first number ($170$) and divide by the second number 1 time 3.\n\n\n### Input(3)\"I was wondering who had the most number of", "answer": " 92"}

It asks us to identify which of the choices we would choose if we had to choose between going for lunch right now or to exercise.\n\n1. As the question doesn't specify whether lunch will be provided in a location where we can exercise or if it's just an ordinary lunch, we can eliminate options A and B.\n2. Choice C, exercise every day, isn't relevant as we aren't being given a choice between exercising and lunch, but an option between exercise or lunch.\n3. Choices D and E are not relevant because they offer specific alternatives rather than a choice between the two.\n4. Therefore option F is chosen as it is more generally applicable because, even if we would like to do something other than exercise, we still have the choice of eating when we exercise.\n\nAnswer: Choice F, eat every day\n\n### Input:\"Awash is the capital of which country?\"\n\n### Demontation\nAwash: a city in Ethiopia.\nCapital: The seat of power in a government.

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. The question asks how much more money she still needs to buy everything she wants, and the shop owner gives her a discount of -15%.\n2. Since she still needs 2/5 more money than she has, we can use the -15% to calculate the amount of money she needs.\n3. In the denominator, we want to find out how much more money she needs. Let's plug in (-15) in the denominator, and then divide the numerator, which is $500\n4. If we do this, the next step is to add the two fractions to get the final answer.\n5. We need two-fifth of $500, which means that our numerator becomes $500+ (2/5)*500.\n6. After calculating the numerator and the denominator, it can be seen that Mrs. Smith needs 10.67 of her $500.\n7.

He spent twice as much time taking on doing homework in biology than in history. We can state that he spent an amount of time equal to three times the time he spent doing biology homework on doing geography homewrok. The time he took for doing biology was 20% of total homework time of all subjects. So, he must have spent 60% of 20 minutes. It will be 60 minutes for doing biology homework. We can state that the biology homework took 1/3 of the total homework time. So, he must be spent 2/3 of total homework time on doing geography, history and biology homework. The time he took to do history was 40% of total homeowrk time. So, he had taken twice the time 20% of history homework that he spent on biology homework. It will be twice 12 minutes. So, the biology homework must be 18 minutes of total homework time. The time he spent to do geography was three times that of history. So, the geography homework took three times the amount of time that was taken for history. It will be 24 minutes for doing geography. Therefore, Max have spent an amount 82 minutes on doing biology homework equal to 20% of his total homework time. He have spent an amount equal to 28% of total homework on doing geogaphy homework.

How many bricks of exact measurement does Libby have available to build the arch?\n\n### Rationales: The question asks for a numerical answer to be supplied, so we must determine the number of bricks of snow by calculating 9 bricks of exact measurement. \n9 bricks of exact measure amount to just over 24 bricks due to the fraction length of the bricks.\n9 is divisible by 5, so we must divide 9 by 5 in order to arrive at 1.8. \nThe result, 1.8, is roughly 1 3/2, which tells us that Libby has roughly two whole bricks and 1.8 full bricks of exact measure. \nWe can round this up to a total of 3 bricks with only a few extra bricks. \nThus, the total number of exact measurement snow bricks is 3.\n\nInput: What's the most likely place to find a person's cell phone?

{"text": "Let's go through  the problem logic-\n1. The question states that John worked 8 hours a  day every day from the  3rd to the \n8th, including the  3rd   and not including the  8th. So, he has worked eight days from the  3rd  to  8th(inclusive and exclusive).\n2. The question asked how many hours he worked. Let's solve this using a formula-\n3. Let x be the total number of hours. We can write the formula for this problem as x=n\\*24, where n=total number of hours. In this case, n=16.\n4. We are given that x is a function of n. In this case, x depends on n because John worked 8 hours every day. So, we can use the product rule in the equation.\n5. The product rule of differentiation is the basic method of deriving the derivatives of the product of two functions.\n6. The formula states that dy\\*dx=f\\*df/dx\\*dx.\n7. We will substitute the values of n, x and the function, f.\n8. We will differentiate the equation with respect to x.\n9. Thus, y=8(16)\\*24.

Choices: 1: singing 2: landing 3: eating 4: taking flight 5: searching for food\nRationales: * The question is asking us what isn\u2019t happening when a bird isn\u2019t flying. * We can cross out 1: singing, because it isn\u2019t necessarily what\u2019s happening every time the bird isn\u2019t flying (birds sing when they feel like it, or when they\u2019re looking for a female). * We can also cross out 3: eating because eating happens to every bird everywhere if there is food around when the bird is in flying distance. The bird will eventually get hungry because of its flight and the body energy it uses when flying. * Choice 4: taking flight. This happens the majority of the time. Birds do take to the sky in order to fly and eat other animals or food. It doesn't happen every second, minute of the day, therefore we can cross this option off. We can cross out choice 5: searching for flight as well, as this is a constant process of bird life.

How much would it cost for 10 cups of the black beans? Choices: A) 30 cents per cup; B) 25 cents per cup; C) 50 cents per cup D) $10\nRationales: To solve the problem, we must find the cost of 10 cups and then divide it by the amount of cups we want, giving us the cost per cup.\nWe can start by comparing the prices of the black beans and the green peas. Because the green peas are cheaper per ounce, we know the black beans are cheaper per cup.\nTherefore, we can immediately eliminate option A, which states that the cost per cup is 30 cents.\n\nNext, we can examine options B and C, which state the cost per cup is either 25 cents or 50 cents respectively.\n\nConsidering that these options state the cost per cup, we know our beans must be 10 cups at this price ($2 or $10).\n\nBut, if we multiply 10 by 25, it's $250. This is more than the $100 for option D.", "answer": " 25"}

By subtracting Tabitha's candy from Julie's candy, we know that Julie caught 12 less pieces. \nStep-5:  Since Carlos caught 14 pieces and Stan only 13, it's evident that Tabitha caught 7 more and therefore 22 + 17 + 7 = 92. \nAnswer: 92", "answer": " 72"}

After the fifth hour, the population will total 1,600 ants because of a previous double.\n\n### Justification 1:The ants' number\nThe ants\u2019 number is 50 ants.\nThis is obvious since according to the question it takes 5 minutes by each time the ants increase double of the previous time it has taken 5 minutes. If the number that was counted was more than 50, it would not make any sense which contradicts our assumption. It would also take less than 5 minutes in the initial number of ants and would not count after each time it took 5 minutes.\n\n### Subtract the final answer from the initial answer (1200-50=1150) to find the number of ants after 5 hours.\nAccording to the calculations made above, it takes 5 minutes with every ant doubling its population, which means 5 minutes = double of 5 minutes. If we add another 5 minutes which is the next unit of 1200, it would give us 1+5=600, then, it would take 5 minutes to get 1200 which gives us 2400.

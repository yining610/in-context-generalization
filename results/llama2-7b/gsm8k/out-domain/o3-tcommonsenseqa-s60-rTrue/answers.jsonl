{"text": "In how many different ways can we count the number of pieces?  Since both the large and small pizza has the same number of slices, we can group them together and the number of slices we have in total is 24. What we can do is write the different ways we can get 24.  In the first row, we see we have 3, then 3 + 1 = 4, and so on. At the end, we have 24 ways of eating out of 1 large and 2 small pizza. So, the answer to how many he can eat is 9.  Step 1: Start by setting up an equation describing how much he can eat. The following two equations are correct: 2L + 2S = 9 (2 Large + 2 Small = 9) 2L + L+2S = 9\n\nStep 2: Use logical reasoning to determine more possible options:  At first, Albert can have 9 slices on the first day. We will call it pizza A. Then he can have 9 (2L+L+2S) remaining slices on the second day. We will call this pizza B.  In the third day, the remaining slices can be pizza C.  In the fourth day, there can be only pizza C and D, the remaining pizza of 9 (2L + S). Each day, each pizza will have a little less of its remaining slices.  Here we see that there are 5 possible pizza for the remaining four days, one day for each pizza. A, B, C, D and E.  (Note: The pizzas do not need to be of the same size. It could be that on the third day there are 5 large pizzas and on the fourth day 4 big pizzas and 1 small pizza.)\n\nStep 3: Write the various combinations:  Given that A = 9, B = 9 (2L), C = 9 (2 S), D = 9C, and E = 9 (2 L + S)  We have that these 5 possible pizzas will be a permutation of the possibilities. E (the day which has 2 large pizza) can have only C or D (2 large and 1 small pizzas)", "answer": " 48"}

He would most likely only do this with the assistance of a weight machine. \n\nSo he is not moving, but only performing resistance training.\n\nNow, we know that the machine, to make his workout more strenuous, makes the weights 20 percent heaver when lowering.\n\nWe don't need to know exactly how this machine works. We only need to know that this machine can add a 20 percent \"feel\" to his training weight. So the 10 sets of 30 pound plates in each direction will equal 20% more weight. \n\nAs Tom would be doing the same thing over and over, we can simplify this down to 2 extra pounds on each rep.\n\nLet's use an example for Tom who has a weight lifting machine that adds 20% to each rep.\n\nHe used to lift 1 set of 5 plates that weighed 150 pounds.\n\nUsing Tom's machine, the weight is now raised 20% or 30 pounds more for each rep.\n\nIn 1st rep Tom would lift 1 (150-20=130) pounds.\n\nIn the 2nd rep Tom would lift 2 (130+20=150);\nIn the 3rd rep Tom would lift 3 (130+60=200);\nAnd in 4th rep Tom would lift 4 (130 +90 =220);\nAnd on the 5th rep he would lift 5 (130 +120 =250).\n\nSo in 4 reps he lifted 4 sets instead of his usual 5. This shows us that a weight machine that adds 2X in the lowering half of each lift, doubles the 1st 2 sets.\n\nThen the 3rd set gets doubled. And then the 4th and 5th sets each are doubled.\n\nThis makes his full set weigh 10 pounds more each set. Which is 20 pounds for each rep. His total weight lifting would be 100 pounds more for half of his set. Tom's full set of 10 plates was now equal to his", "answer": " 360"}
{"text": "Step 1: Identify the key information about the situation and the numbers given. Nate is searching for his car in a parking lot at an airport. The key numbers to solve this question are: 1. The length of a row in Section G (10 cars), 2. The total number of sections (2), 3. The pace Nate can walk through a row (11 cars per minute), and 4. The time it takes for Nate to search one row (1 minute).\nStep 2: Use the information given to set up the problem. We can use the problem to determine the total number of sections in each section (15 + 20 = 35 sections), and we can also use the information about Nate's pace to determine the total time it would take for him to search for his car. The information given shows that there are 15 rows in each section and 11 cars per row, so we can use this to derive the number of cars in the whole parking lot, which is 920 cars.\nStep 3: Find the answer based on the information. With this information, we can set up the equation: N = 920 * 1 / (11 * 60). By simplifying this equation, we find that Nate took, at most, one hour and fifteen seconds to find his car, given that he spent 15 minutes searching one section.\nStep 4) Analyze your response. Nate walked past a total of 15 cars per row (15 * 60 = 900 cars), and he walked through the 35 sections in the airport parker lot. Therefore, it would take him 35 X 15 minutes to search for his car, since each time he passes fifteen cars, the time takes one minute. In this situation, the option that most closely describes what you did to solve this problem is A: Find the total amount of seconds it would take according to the information given, and apply a simple formula to that information. So the answer is A: Find the full amount of seconds it would and apply a simple formula\nSo the final answer. 0.4175", "answer": " 30"}

However, he has not done well at this during the weekend and needs to make up the difference in reading on Saturday. He has surpassed his Friday goal on Thursday and is only two pages from meeting his goal for the week as of Thursday.\nThe best way to solve this is to determine how many pages he needs to read on Saturday in order to meet his goal. To do this, we must use the information available and make an educated guess by applying logic to the situation. \nFirst, we know he read 43 on Sunday, 66 on Monday, and 0 on Tuesday. These facts can be used to calculate the average number of pages he read in that time period. From Sunday to Monday, Berry's average was approximately 22 pages. \nNext, we know he read a total of 229 on Wednesday, and 226 on Thursday. This information can be used to calculate his average number of pages he reads in one day. From Wednesday to Thursday, Berry's consistent average was approximately 21 pages. \nNow that we know the average pages he reads each day and the total pages he has read up to Thursday, we can calculate the difference in pages he will need to read on Saturday to meet his goal. When we subtract the average from total, the difference is -1.26 pages. We will need to read 1.26 pages more on Saturday than we read on average. \nNow that this has been calculated, we can determine our answer.

{"text": "Step 2: First consider 236 dollars. You can spend $1 per 1 dollar, 2 per 2 dollars, 3 per 3 dollars, and so on. \nStep 2: Next, consider 14 dollars. You can spend 1 per 1 dollars, so 14 / 1 = 14. If each book cost $14, we would have spent all our money ($14 per each book).\nTherefore, it can be said that each book cost $11.25. So the answer is E: 11.25 per book.\n\nTo calculate the average, you can do this: the total = $236; the value of each book = $11.20.\nThe average is calculated by dividing the total value of the books by the number of books. In this case, $236 divided by $6 = 40. The average is calculated to be $40. So $11-$40 = -30 cents per book. So, the answer would be E: 1125$ per book.\n\n\nInput: Is a penguin a bird?

The question asks how long it takes for her to serve all of her patients. \n\nStep 1: To determine the time needed to serve all of her patient. The first step is to determine the number of minutes it takes to serve each patient.\n\nStep 1a: To determine the number of minutes needed to serve a patient with standard care we have 12 patients requiring standard meals. So we multiply 12 with 5. \n\nStep One: This means it takes 12 minutes for Missy to serve a patient with just standard care. So we have this information in mind.\n\nStep 2:  We can use this information to determine the additional time necessary to serve the patients with a special diet. \n\nStep2: These special diet patient need an additional 20% that is extra time because of their need for special diet care. So the extra time they will need is 20% of 12 minutes or 2.4 minutes. So the additional time is 2.4 mins.\n\nStep 3: We can add these two times together: 12+2.4= 14.4.\nTherefore, it takes 14.4 minutes to serve patients with an additional 20%.\n\nStep 4: The nurse wants to give all of her patients dinner.

For instance, let the original price of the shoes at Apple store be $50. \n\nStep2: Decide how much money the customer should save. So, in store 1, the price of two pairs of shoes becomes ($50*1/4) - ($50*1) = $10 - $50 = $40. In a similar way, the customer will now save another $20 (45% of $40) in the pears store and $20 (20% of $40 + $35) in the Mimosa store, respectively.\nStep 3: Calculate the money you will save with a sale. Let us consider the dress. Since this store has a sale of 20%, the original price is ($100*1/4), and you\u2019ll save $20. \nNow, you can calculate the total saved money by making the list. For instance, the shoes in Apple store will cost you $40. Similarly, in pear store, two shoes cost you $40 and in Mimosa, two shoes cost $80.

An option to meet the passing grade is selecting 90% as the answer for the question.\nA: 100% \u2013 There\u2019s no way a cowboy would get 100% on an exam as the grade can\u2019t be higher than 100%.\nB: 20% \u2013 If the grade 78% is meant for cowboy only, any other result with the percentage will not satisfy the passing grade 78% but only with 100%. \nC: 0% \u2013 A cowboy cannot fail to achieve a required passing grade 78%. The grade is definitely below the passing grade requirements and is unlikely 0% (fail). The passing grade 78 is not even an option to select the passing grade while choosing D: 78% as the passing grade, as D is the correct option, and thus the answer is D: 78%.\nSo the final Answer  is D: 7 8%", "answer": " 5"}

Note that this may not be true if you\u2019re in another country:\n\n1) The first option of 120 million is the total gross for an opening weekend, not the net profit.\n\n2) The second option of 100 is the total gross, not the profit.\n\n3) In the following calculations, the movie cost would be subtracted before any profit shares are applied.\n\nFirst, calculate the total gross of the movie. If we just assume it\u2019s 120 million since it had a 3.5x the opening weekend gross, then it makes (120 million \u00d7 3.5)/100 = 450 million in total gross.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the profit. We know the profit is 60% of the gross. 450 million multiplied by.60 would be 270 million total profit.\n\nFinally, subtract the production cost of 60 million, leaving us with 240 million in profit.\n\nSo the answer is 240 million.\n\nSo the final answer 240 million\n\nInput: A new book is released with a cover price of $20.

{"text": "In order to fully understand this problem, it is necessary to recognize that a serving of an energy drink is measured in ounces rather than grams of caffeinated material which is the more common unit of measurement. \nIn addition, it is also important to know that the serving size of an energy drink and the serving size of the caffeine pill are in different units. \n\nHence, step one is to convert the serving size of the energy drink in ounces, which are the most common units in such scenarios. \n\nThe second step is to convert the serving sizes of drink and caffeine pill to the same unit. The amount of caffeine in an energy drink is the amount of caffeined that is required to produce the observed effect. \n\nSince the units are different, multiply 192 by 95.1 to get the caffeine content in grams. \n\nThere are 30 servings of 12-ounce energy drink. \n\nTo determine the number of servings in a 2-ounce energy drink, multiply the volume of the 2-ounce drink by the serving size of 12-ounces. The 2-ounce drink has four servings. \n\nSince each serving of this 2-ounce drink contains only 250 mg of caffeine compared to the first energy drink with 275 mg, the caffeine consumed is 960 + 114/6.\n\nTherefore the answer is 1,054 mg.\n\nSo the final answer for how much caffeine does John consume is 1,036.\n\nInput: Why doesn't a teacher always correct all errors on his or her students' handouts?

The question then asks how many plums she bought.\nStep 2-3: Look for the number of plums she bought by elimination.  A plum is not often referenced as'small basket of plums' in a supermarket setting, so this isn't the relevant choice. Nor is a basket, implying a collection, one large basket, which is reasonable. Thus, A basket of plums and A small basket of plums can be ruled out.\nStep 4-5: Consider only the choices that are likely. To rule out the unrealistic choices, the plum quantities in the choices are checked in the question. It is stated there was 19 pieces of plum fruit in total, including half that fell out on the way home. So, 14 pieces are still left in their bag, but the other half fell out. This implies that a plum is equal to or less than ten in the choices. So choices A, B, and C can be eliminated.\nStep 6-7: Find the answer by elimination: Thus, the answer becomes choice D. It states that she bought one small basket of plums. D remains as the likely choice even if they are no longer considered a basket, but plums would be less likely than pears or pineapples as the amount they buy would make the bag's hole visible.  The plum would also be more likely to have been crushed because it is softer, leaving the pear and apple crisper. So, it is unlikely to have the same volume.  This eliminates choices B, C, D, and E.  The question concludes and asks about plums, but with the answer choice of one.\nStep 8: Analyze if the answer is true or not. Since the answer is 1, that means that she bought only a small basket of plum s, and therefore, there are 19 pieces of fruit in total including half that fell out.  This answer is true, and the answer is A: One small basket of plums\n\nSo the final answer\n\nis A: One small basket", "answer": " 6"}

Choices:  a) many more paper clips  b) many more stamps - c) many more books  d) many more shoes\nOutput: This is a logic reasoning type of question where you have to think logically to determine the correct option.\n\nStamp collector = stamp collecting and coin collector = coin collecting\n\nOption A: Many more paper clips: This does not make sense as collecting coins is unrelated to collecting paper clips.\n\nOption B Many more stamps: The answer cannot be A or B. Stamp collecting requires a great deal of organization and classification of the stamps. Stamps are usually put in an album to keep them organized and easy to identify. These characteristics are opposed to the ones that characterize coin collecting. Coin collection does not require this level of organization because it doesn't require the individual to determine the rarity of their stamps, unlike stamp collections.\n\nOption C Many more books: This answer is unlikely because collecting stamps and collecting books have opposite characteristics. Stamp collecting typically involves organizing stamps to identify the rarity of each stamp and to identify each mint (place each stamp comes from). Therefore, the answer cannot be C. \n\nOption D Many more shoes: This answer is unlikely to as collecting shoes does not require organization or classification as a stamp collection does for a stamp collector. In fact, collecting shoes may involve collecting sneakers and shoes of different cultures, which does not seem to be associated with a stamp collection at all.\nTherefore, the correct option would be D: coin collector. This is the only option that makes sense as the coin collector would likely collect coins as well as coins from different countries and periods such as ancient coins or collect coins from a particular mint.\nThus, the correct answer would be D: Coin collector.\n\nAnswer: D: Coin collecting\n\nInput & Output:\nQuestion:\nIt has rained nearly every day this week.

So, we can say that we have one orange and we eat for 3 bites as well. Now that we know that we eat 3 bites for our one orange, we now know that it takes us 3 bites to eat one orange. The same holds true for the brother, we can say that it takes the brother 3 bites to satisfy his need for the orange. Therefore, we can say that the brother's needed bites for them to eat their 2 oranges are 6 bites for him.

{"text": "Step 0: Since the question is about how many inches tall is GRCIE in this sentence, GRCie=GRCINE\nStep 1: Find the values. Substitute them to the mathematical equation to find out the answer. We will solve the equation. To solve this equation, use the Distributive Property to move the 2 over. 7 =x Substitute 2 for 2x. 2 + 7 = x Substitute -2 for 27 Divide by 2. 2 = x /2\nIn a fraction, in the numerator, the 7 would be on the outside. That numerator is still 7 and becomes 7/2. 7/2 = X/4\nThe last step will be to convert it into a whole number. 7/4 = X/2\nTo check, we need to subtract 2. 7-2 = X/2 - 2 = X-2. This is 7/2-2 = X-2/2. If we subtract X from 2 and divide by 2 it's 0-2/2. This is a negative number. If X is a positive number (since it's whole numbers) it needs to have a + or - in front of it so when we divide this by 2 we will get 0/ 2 = 0. We got 0 X 0 = 0.

Let n be the number of CDs he gave to his friend. Let x be the number of CDS he bought from the music store. \nWe can state the initial condition that he has 21 CDS by using P=21. Then we can start our equation for the number of CDS after Tyler buys 8 brand-new CDS from the music store. CDS x=8. \nNow the new equation becomes; P + n - x= 21. By multiplying both sides of the equation by the minus (-) symbol and adding the two sides, the new equation looks like this; -P -n+ x+21= -P -n -8. To solve for P, we must first subtract the left side of the equation from both sides. \nAfter rearranging, the new equation looks to be: -P = 9. To solve for P or the number of CDs, we can subtract 9 from both sides of the equation. Then -x is equal to P (number of CDS). The new equation has the final result; -x=9 so x=9. From there, we can plug the value of x=9 into the original equation, and the final value is P=12. So the number of CDs that Tyler have will be 12. \nSo the final answer 12", "answer": " 22"}

The answer may be obvious, but our approach is to determine the time as stated in the question. To begin, we should note the time from home to the gym. The answer should therefore be, 12:20, 1:10, 2:50, 3.40, or 4:30 at the latest. Now we move on to the last option. It reads, \"Tuesday, 5:10\" So, in this scenario, we should multiply the 5:10 by six, which gives us 30. Now we divide 30 by six, this will give us 5, which could equate to \"5-minute intervals\". So, in this case, it'll be Tuesday 5th at 10 to 5 that the gym will close. We can say this was the time the gym would close on Tuesday. Now, a person should note the time they reach the gym not when the gym closes. This statement is true in this situation since no one would be at the gym at the time their timings expired. It would be unreasonable to expect someone to show up at the gym at 12:23 when their timings ended at 5:10. The above option is the only correct answer, and the time at which Ben may have arrived at the gym was at 1:10. So the final answer is D.\nSo the final option will be D.\n\nInput: If the next-door neighbors are", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "The first thing to understand in this problem is that it implies that the total number of animals on the boat is 47 (20 sheep and 14 dogs).\nStep 2: Then, we are looking for the total number of animals surviving the boat. If we want to get a total number of surviving animals, we first need to know how many animals from each group went down with the boat. We can then subtract these amounts from the given total number of animals in each group, to find the overall survival number. \nStep 1: First, find how many animals died from each group. Since the boat capsized, the total sheep died = 20 sheep + (3/2[ten cows])\nStep 2: From 3 sheep drowned, subtract from the given total number in this group 20 sheep.\nStep 3: So from 3 sheep drown, the total number of sheep survived is 17 (20 - 3).\nStep 4: Since the cow group survived with 8 more number than sheep, we can deduce that the total number of cows survived is not 17. Let us take it as 6.\nStep 5 & 6: Similar to the sheep, lets subtract the known total number in this group (10) and find out the number of cows drowned from the known number (6). Hence the total number of cats that survived or came to shore is 14.\nHence the total number of animals that came to shore or survived is 14 + 6 = 20\nSo the final answer to this problem is 20, there were 20 animals that survived that catastrophe.", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "The following analysis method can be used, given the problem statement.\nStep 1: The first question is which rope has the longest length. By comparing the length of each rope in the collection, we can see that the 20-foot and 8-foot ropes are the longest two available ropes. The 20-foot rod is longer than the 8-foot rod, so the 20- foot rope will be chosen as the base from which we shall start.\nStep 2. Determine how many knots the 20-foor rope will have after the addition of the other ropes. In this step, we assume that each knot will diminish a total of 1.2 feet from the overall length of each rope. Given the total length of the 20-feet rod, which is 20x1.2 = 24 feet, which means that each knot is 24 feet/20 = 1.2 feet. So the number of knots on 20-feets rope is 24/1.2 = 19.2 knots. \nStep 2a. Given that there will be 19.2 rope knots, we move onto the next rope, and then calculate the knots for each rope and continue for all five ropes, and their addition to the 20- feet is also part of the calculation for the total length.\nStep 3.

In this case, the most notable restriction would be when considering the number of years in a calendar year. \n\nIf we look at a calendar for this specific year, we can see that the year 1920 consists of 12 months, and there are 365 days per year. \n\nSo considering, 1910 would not fit into 12 months and has 365 days; this number would require a 37th day to become valid (with 365*13 becoming 438), and thus, the number 1910 cannot be considered a valid year. \n\nEasier to answer is A \n\nInput:A new house was built on the lot.

You should list the three types of tasks in a column format to see how much each task generated in a month.\nStep 3: Determine the value of the total gross income from the completed task in a month.\n1. Task $x: Task $x: Grace mowed lawns x63, pulled weeds x9 and put down mulch x10 in a month. Multiply these total hours worked for each of the tasks by the per-hour cost rate. This would be $6 x 63 hours, $11 x 9 hours and $9 x10 hours.\n2. Task $y: Task $y: Multiply the final gross income by the total number of hours to come up with the total gross income for the month. This would be $441 x 152 hours.\n\n\nStep4: Since we know that Grace started her own landscapers business, we can conclude that no one else worked for Grace in September. Also, total gross income must be used here and not gross income per hour.\nSo the final total amount of money Grace earned during the month of September would be $44,100. \n\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question above.\n\nInput: What 2 numbers, added together, would produce the number 5628?

{"text": "Lydia has a fixed quantity of water and a constantly decreasing amount of time available to refill her pool. \n\nTo fill the pool with the maximum water, Lydia has to fill her pool before the pool completely drains.  This is represented by a situation where the pool is initially empty.  As she fills the pool, the amount of water in it increases but at the same time the amount of time available to do so decreases.  Therefore, the time needed to fill the pool is finite: it ends when she stops filling if the pool stays at least partly full.\n\nGiven the problem description, it is known that Lydia has 60 gallons to put in, that she can put in 1.6 gallon/minute, and that she has some time to put the water in.  The first step is to find out how long it would take to fill the pool to capacity with 0.5 remaining capacity - that is, until the pool holds 61 gallons.  We know that 60/1.6 = 37.5, so since she has 60 gallon and 1.6 gall/minute coming in, it would take 37.5 min for her to fill the 60 gallons completely.  She would have 0.5 gallons left over of what time is left.\n\nWe don't need the extra information about the leak to find the total number of minutes required to fill the pool completely.  If she can replace 60 gallons in 37.5 minutes, that means she can replace 0.5 gallon in... 1/134 of the time she had left initially, or 2.5/3*that time.  Therefore, because she can replace all the water in the pool in 37.1% or 1/3 of the time, she will have 29.375 minutes remaining when she has fully replaced her 60 gallons. \n\nThe remaining 29.3875 minutes are not enough to replace 60 gallon/1.6 gallon per minute minus 0.1 gallon per minute.  Since the pool loses 1 gallon a minute while the hose only put in 1.5 gallons a minute, this is not feasible.  Therefore, the leak", "answer": " 40"}

The next value that follows the sequence 1,2,3,4,5 is 6.  - Starts with the value 1: This is just asking for the first element of the sequence. We can use the head function in Python to access the first element in a sequence as follows: head(sequence). - The only element that ends with 5: This can be easily computed by subtracting the the value 1 from the value of \u2018Element\u2019 in the sequence. Therefore, the complete element is Element - 1 = Element - 4. Once we compute the elements that fall between 1 to 4, the equation reduces to Element - 1 = 5. For example: if our sequence contains the values 2,3,4 and 5, the element will be Element - 1 = (2 - 1), which will be 1, meaning the fifth element is 5.

{"text": "The question asks, how many points did James beat an old record by who is considered to have scored 300 points. \n\nGuidelines in solving this math problem: \n\nLet us say the old record was 3 points per game and we want to determine the new record using the same variables (4 touchdowns per 15 games) and (10 conversions). \n\nSo the new record should be (2 touchdowns + 2 points conversions) x 15 = 60 points per game. \n\nTherefore, 60 points per 15 games is 4 points per game more than the old record.  This indicates that John scored 10 points more than the old record, for a total of 40 points.\n\nSo the answer is 40 points. \nSo the final answer  is D: 40 points\n\nInput: A group of musicians playing a song during an orchestra practice decided to increase the speed of the song.  How much time would it take to double the speed of the song?\nOutput: The given information is that a musical group is playing a song at a certain pace and decides to increase that speed by double the time. \nTo double the speed, it takes two times to make one.  This means, that for it to take 2 times to do something, the task must take one time to do it. Therefore, it is assumed that it took one hour for the musical group to complete their song at the original speed and now wishes to double the speed. \n\nIt is evident that one hour is the time it took the musical group to reach the original song at a slow pace. However, to double the speed, it was 2 hours in total since doubling time results in two times the original time. \n\nConsequently, doubling the speed resulted in a one-time increase and it took two hours to complete the song.  Since there is already an hour and half spent towards doubling the speed, that leaves us with half an hour. \n\nHence, it took 30 minutes to increase the speed by double the time in comparison to the original time.  So, the correct response is: 30 minutes is the approximate time needed to double the speed of song.\nSo I think the final answer is D.  1 hour + 30 minutes = approx", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "So, the answer is D: There are three trees. \n\nYou are going to break down the problem and solve it one element at a time. James has 2 trees. These trees have 20 plants. The first part of it, it's not clear whether he plants them himself or if he hires someone. However, James collects all the fruits from their two trees which only leaves the option that he collects them himself. After this, we can start counting the fruits from each plant. \n\nOption A: There are 92 seeds on each plant. Option D: There are 90 seeds on each plant, we can count out that there are 100 seeds. Since James plants 90 percent of what he collects in total there is 54 seeds on each tree. \n\nOption B: There are 30 seeds on each tree there are 60 of those. 60% of 30 is 18 so each tree has 18 seeds that would not be enough to fill two trees. \n\nOption C: There are 60 seeds on each plants there are 20 trees. 20 trees does not have an answer, meaning that 20 plants are not equal to 20 trees. However, since the option refers to trees and he has 20 plants there are not 20 trees. There will be more than 20 plants to count.  \n\nOption E: There is only 10 seeds on each of these plants. That would not be enough for either one. With that option 10 seeds is not an option in this question.\n\nSo now we're going to count the fruits on each tree. There are 60% of the plant seeds planted and he only plants 90% of them. So James had 48 seeds that he planted.  If we divide 92 by 30 we get 3. So 48 divided by three is 16. There are 16 trees.   \n\nNow, since there are one flower on each of those seeds. That means that there are a total of 51 flowers on all 16 trees. So there are flowers on 16 different trees. \n\nNow we are going to double check our results", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "Step 1: Break down the question into pieces to understand what the question is asking. The important question here is \u201chow much more is Gary spelling per month?\u201d\nStep 2: Calculate this amount. For a fixed loan (in this case $6,00) with a fixed interest rate of 7% applied, the formula used to calculate the amount to pay every month is APR = ((1 + r ) ^ n) / ((1 + r) ^ (n-1)))*(1- (1 / (1+r)^n)), where r= rate, n= number of times a rate is applied in a year, and APR= annual payment rate. In this case we don\u2019t know the rate and the number of times it is applied in a year.

In this task, there is remaining time and it's equal to 75-20=55 seconds. So the task is still ongoing, and the completion time is not yet known.\nStep 2. Calculate the required hot dogs per minute. This can be computed as the completion time divided by the time remaining which is 4.175/55 s/min= 75-25.79= 39.75. So, Lisa will need to eat 39.74 hot dogs per minute.\nStep 3: Solve the remaining time using our initial equation. Since the completion time and the time Lisa needs to eat hot dogs is equal, the total time remains at 75 seconds. So, there is a shortfall of 24.79 seconds.\nStep 4. Subtract the remaining time from the target completion time. So, the actual completion time is 25.79 seconds. This tells us how many hot dogs Lisa will need to finish the task.

{"text": "So the question is asking how many beakers do not contain copper ions if the number 45 was used in testing before the true result was found in all 8 of the beaker with copper ions.\nStep 1: First, make a list of the beakers that are supposedly tested. This gives us an idea of the total number of beakers that are at play in the experiment.\nStep 2, list the number of beakers that contain copper ions. According to the question, there are only 8 which means 8 beakers contain copper ions each.\nStep 3: Use the information from the above two steps to create the following equation. No. of beakers with copperions = No. of beakers without copperions + 8\nStep 4: Solve the equation in step 3 to find the No. of beakers that do not contain copperions = No of beakers - 8 (This can be worked out using algebra if needed.)\nStep 5: Calculate the answer to the question. The number of beakers that do contain copper ions was also found to be 8 and thus, no. of beakers that contain no copper ions is 14.\nSo the final answe is No. of beakers free of copper ions =14.\nSo, the correct answer is no. of beakers free free of copper isons=14.\n\nInput:A man can do a piece of work in 6 days working 8 hours a day.

{"text": "Step 0: We will solve this by finding the amount of money that Nadia used to buy flowers, but we should first decide what to call the unknown number. One way of doing this is to think about a situation where there is only one type of flower and then decide what to call the number. For example, \"Amy spent $64.25 purchasing roses, which are double the price of daisies.\" \"I just bought $25.63 worth of daisies. Unfortunately, they are $8 cheaper than roses.\"\nStep 1: Nadia bought 20 roses for $100.00 and 3/4 the number of lilies. What does 3/4 the amount of something mean? We know that it is three for every four, so 3/4 is equivalent to 3/(4 * 4). We know that 3 /(4 * 4) is equal to 3 * (1/4) * 4 = 3 * 0.25 = 0.75. This makes it 0.75 times as much. If we represent the number of roses by 20R, the number of lillies that she bought can be represented by 20L * 0.75 because that is the number of lililies that she bought.\nStep 2 : The equation can be written as 0.75 * (20R + 20L *0.75). Thus, the answer is equal to 18.75R + 9L, which is 187.5R + 37.5L. 0.75 is the amount that she purchased lilies three times, which is three times 4 or 12. Thus, the required total from step. 1 is 18.734R + 54.75L. You can use your calculator to evaluate this and get your answer. If you prefer, you can use a pencil and paper and simply add these integers together to get 73.\n\nStep 3: If you would like to check your answer to confirm your work, plugging in your values of 20 Roses (R) and 37.5 Lilies (L) gives you 702.50D.", "answer": " 250"}

Since 13lb bag has an added up cost if he buys them, he will select a cheaper one. \n\nStep2:\n\nTo decide which is the cheapest he can afford to buy, determine how many 10lb bags he can afford based on $ 10\n\n$10 \u2013 4 X $10 = $0. This means he is left with $0 left to use to buy 10lb of bags. Since he wants to buy the most amount of fluf, it will make sense for him to get additional 10lb of flour, therefore, he would be able to afford to get 11lb of 10lb bag of flour for $10.\n\nStep 3: Conclude that the optimal solution is to buy the 11lb 10lb bag to save the most amount of money. The cost of it will be $ 10 + (11lb / 12lb * 2). So, the cost will be $11.56. \n\nSo the final answer should", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "First, break down the wording into understandable parts. The store owner calculates the retail price based on the wholesale price plus a percentage. \n\nIn the given scenario, the seller buys a pair of pants for $36 and the retail price is $36 ($36 is the cost to the customer).\nHowever, the seller does not sell the items at the same price. Since $36 is the seller\u2019s cost, he sells it for $64 which is the total of the wholesale price and the additional markup. This gives a net gain of $72 - $36 = $36.\nThe net gain of $36 is equivalent to the additional markup which was 80% of the original wholesale price (64 / 80 = 120/80 \u00d7 36 = $32) and adding it to the original wholesale cost.\n\nFinally, the retail price is 64 - 80% \u00d7 $64 = 64 \u2013 32 = $32.\nTherefore, the wholesale price is $32.\nSo the final wholesale price is 32", "answer": " 20"}

Eustace is twice as long-lived as Milford.\n\nSo, Eustace is 2 time more long lasting and Milford is half as old as Eustace.\n\nStep 2: Solve for Milford's age. Based on above information Milford is half of Eustace's age, we can solve that Milford is 39/2 times of Eustace' s age. So Milford will be a few times less in age than Eustace.\nAnswers: Milford is less than twice as long-living as Eustace. That way Eustace is 4x the age of Milford but Milford will be at 2x the age of Eustace in 3 years from now.

The monthly food budget is therefore equal to 60%.\nTo calculate the phone bill budget, subtract 1440 from 240: 240 \u2013 1440 = -1060. Then, divide -1060 by 240: -1060/240. The -1060 represents the phone bill and the 240 represents the food budget. This number is equal 0.043125, which is Luna's phone budget in decimal format.\nThe following formula is used to calculate the total budget in a situation like this one: ((monthly budget)/(house rental/food budget)). This formula means that the total monthly budget is equal to 0.0466667/(6/60) = 6/600 or 6% of the total budget.\n\n1. House Rental Budget\nHouse Rental Budget = 240\n\n2.

This can be done by estimating the average capacity of each car by subtracting the seating capacity (2) from the total line's size (84), which leaves a number of 82.\nStep 2. Calculate the total number of trips (the times) that the ride operator will have to take by simply multiple the roller's car's capacity (2) with our derived number from the first step. The formula is: 2*82, which gives us: 164.\nStep 3: We can also use a more accurate estimation from the first step which is: 168. If you subtract 3 from 168, you get 165. Now divide the number of possible trips by this number (165).\n164 (first option) divided  by 165 (second option)\n\nWe can also simplify, by subtracting the numbers' difference (4/164+165-4)\n\nNow, we can determine how accurate the first or the second answer is: 164 (first number)/ 165 (2nd number) = 98.8%.

Therefore, you would need to divide the amount of water (in ounces) that the garage hole leaks over a 2- hour time period by the amount of time (in minutes) that it rains. Multiplying 990 by 30, which is the amount of minutes in 2 hours since 66*2 = 132 oz then finally multiplying it by 5. This is because 30*5 gives us the equivalent in how many ounces of water that is equal to the rate that 1 medium-size hole leaks at 18 ounz every hour and 10 ounz every 1 hour since 5*5 is equal to 5, and 5 is how many minutes every 1 hour.

{"text": "Sandy bought 1 million Safer Moon tokens, and she wants to split these tokens 50/50 with each of her siblings. \n\nGiving the information that Sandy has 4 siblings makes it clear that she has 4 siblings, so 1 million SafeMoon tokens will be divided into 4 pieces per sibling. This means that each sibling will receive an equal portion of the token's value.\nIn the question, it is also mentioned that each sibling will have half of the tokens, which means that Sandy will have the remaining half. This means that she will have 4 times as many tokens as each of her siblings, so how many tokens she will have is four times as many tokens as her siblings.\n\nThe question also mentions that Sandy bought 1000 more Safe Moon tokens than the two least tokens, which indicates that the number of tokens in each piece is not divisible by 5. This tells us that the number of tokens Sandy will have after splitting is not divisible by her number of siblings which indicates that she will have a remainder token. \n\nGive that Sandy and two of her siblings each have 8 tokens, the question asks how many more tokens she will have than any of her 3 remaining siblings. However, since Sandy and two of the siblings each have 50/57 tokens, the question requires us to express how many more tokens she has than any of her other siblings. Considering the rest of the statement, it is safe to assume that her other siblings do not have any SafeMoon tokens.\nSo, to calculate the number of tokens Sandi will have:\nRemembering that Sandi has 4 siblings means that each sibling has two pieces for a total of 8 pieces, the original question asks how many more SafeMoons Sandi will have than any of the two remaining siblings, who each have 8 tokens. \n\nIf we calculate the difference in tokens Sandi will have remaining after the exchange, it is half of each sibling and 50 tokens - 8 tokens, or 42, tokens, which is equal to 4 times 11, her number of tokens, which is equivalent to 44. Therefore, the answer is: 44 tokens.\nSo the final Answer is B: 44", "answer": " 375000"}

In the equation it asks how many cups of this drink in 18 total cup in the pitcher. The unknown in this equation is how many cups of the lemonade in the 18 cups in the pitcher. \n\nStep 3: Estimate the unknown variable by using the information given. The first thing to know in any equation is to know how much total each ingredient is. \nHere, 1/4 of cup means four fourths of the total cup. We have a lemonade cup that is 1/4 of the total cup.\nAnother cups in the ingredients is 1/3 which is 1 and 3 / 4ths.

This would be equal to length of the flowerbed, plus the width of the fenced flowerbed, plus an additional 1 meter to account for the width of the fencing. \n\nStep5: Determine the length of the fencing. The length multiplied by the width, or the multiplier, equals the total length. This is simply the addition of the length, width, and 1 meter. \n\nFor the calculation:\n\n4 = Length of Flowebed\n1 = (2) = Width of Flowebed\n5 = Length + Width = Total length of fencing\n4 + 1 = Width of fencing\n\nTherefore, our final answer is C: 4 meters, because the government would need to fence off the flowerbed to create a rectangular flower bed that is 4 meters wide and length of 1 meter shy. \nSo the final answer will be C: 4 meters\n\ninput:The government offers the citizens a discount. This is a benefit (10%) worth 5 cents per liter of gasoline.

{"text": "Step 0: Gather information from the question and organize it for easy understanding. The question is asking us to determine the number of ripe fruits remaining if Lindsay only ate 60% of all ripe mangoes. This means that, given the amount of ripe mango available initially, we need to find the percentage of remaining mangoes consumed by Lindsay. We can do this by subtracting the percentage of ripe mango eaten, and multiplying the result by the total number of mangoes.\nStep 1: Identify and understand what's needed to solve the problem. The number of remaining ripe mango left will equal the number of mangoes Lindsay ate - the part she ate multiplied by 6.\nStep 2 : Make mental calculations. In 3/5 of remaining mangoes, we are substracting 6-25% of remaining mangoes(which is the total amount of mangoes eaten by Lindsay) and we now multiply the answer by the total number of fruits remaining, 350.\n\nStep 3: Solve the initial problem. We will now subtract 6-0.3 and mulitply the answer by the total to get the number of ripe mangos Lindsay will enjoy.\nStep 4 :Checkwork.

If there were 40 total kids, and 1/4 of them went tubing, 66.67% of the rafting excussion went tubing. That percentage is equal to 1/8, or 12.5%, meaning that 1/8 of the rafting kids went tubing.

However, for the question, only the kids who were on the kiddos who were exclusively on rafting are of interest. In order to find the number of kids who went on the Rafting excertion, subtract 15 from 40, and we have 25. 25 minus 15 is equal to 10 kids on the Rafting and tubing excursion, meaning that 10/25, or 40% of the rafters, were also on the tubers. \nThus, there were 9 kiddos who exclusively joined the tubers who also joined the rafters.

In this case, there are 20 total rows, so each row has 10 seats.\n\nNext, multiply the number of seats in each row by the number of rows in the church to determine the total number of seats available. This is the number of seats that can be filled by people attending the church. In this case, the total number of seats is 200, as there are 20 x 10 seats. \n\nNow, to determine the number of people that have to sit in the available seats for the church to be filled, subtract the number of seats available from the number of people who attend the church. In other words, divide the total number of attendees by the number of seats available. In our case, the total number is 240, so the number of people that would need to sit in the available chairs is 40% of 240 or 100.\n\nTherefore the answer is A.

Therefore, 100 is the total number of cars that could be parked in the front parking of the theater.\nStep 3 : Calculate the number of extra cars parked at the front: There is one play and there are 2 seats in each room (the total capacity of the theater). We know that 100 cars parked on the first level, so we can calculate the total capacity of 2 seats per room by 2 \u00d7 100 = 200, which is the total capacity of the the second level of the parking lot or the capacity of 100 additional cars for parking.\nStep 5 : Multiply the number of extra parking spaces to get the number of extra cars: The answer would be 200 (2nd level capacity) times the 700 answer in the question. The final answer that is the number of extra cars at the parking lot during a play would be 140.000.\nFinal answer : 140000\n\nInput: A school conducted a survey and found that 4 students out of 5 preferred their 7am class and 3 out of 4 preferred 8am.

{"text": "The question asks how much should a farmer sell each bag if the farmer wants to make a profit when selling their surplus. \nInput: In order to calculate the percentage increase, it is necessary to calculate the current and original values, in this case, the percentage increase should be calculated as: Current value / Original value = x * 100 \nTherefore, the formula for the percentage increase is as follows: Current value \u2013 Original value = X where X is the percentage increase. \nIn this question, the initial value is $50, the initial expenses are $84.50, the amount of corn is 10 bags, so the percentage increase is calculated as: $0.96 = 10*0.96=$10.04 or 0.96%.\nThus, in order to make a profit of $9.52 (10% of $95.20), you should sell each bag for $10.50 ($10 + $0.50 is an approximate price for one bag but since the original value was $50, $10.5 $ is a rough estimate of the new price, which is equal to 10.5/$50=21%.\nIf you sold each bag for $12.50, the profit would be $9.52, which is the profit expected for each bag. Based on this, it is not necessary to add an additional $5.50 per bag, which is the total original value ($50+$35+$15) minus the initial value ($50).\nSo the final answer for how much should the farmer sell each bag, if the farmer wants a profit of 15% is $9.52.\nSo the final price should be $10.5.

So we can set the chart:\nStep 2: Next, to start, let consider inviting another guest to attend, let's suppose that a person invite another person, what are the chances that the next one invited will invite another person? 2 /2 = 1 The probability that another person will invite another person is 1. So we can draw another chart:\nStep 3: So we can see the probability is 1.

This can be calculated using 16 + 25 = 41. \n\nSince 16 is used in the problem as a benchmark, this means that Parker threw the ball for a distance of 16 yards.\n\nBy calculating the total distance that Grant threw, we can determine that he threw the ball 100% farther than Parker.  This can be calculated using: (25/24) (100/100) = 25/24 = 1.08 (approximate)\n\nHence, to compare Kyle's distance from Parker's, we need to use Kyle's distance (120) from Grant's (100) to find the value of what? Choices:  1.08 (approx) 120 - 100 = 20  (approx 1.08)2 16 + (1.08)^2 = approx 44  Kyle threw it approximately 44 yards farther than Parker.  Thus, Kyle threw it approximately [20 * 1.08] - 20 = 19 yards farther than Parker.\n\nFor an easier answer, as the questions is asking to compare Kyle against Parker and Parker to Grant, we assume they are all starting the same at 0 so 19 yards is how far Kyle threw the ball since Parker threw the ball 0 yards and Grant threw the ball 15 yards. Therefore, Kyle threw the ball an extra 19 yards on top of that so the answer is B: 19 extra yards.\n\nSo the final answer 19 extra yards \n\nInput:If a store clerk wanted to add 53% to $77.50, what would be the answer?

We should plug in the value of the sum of the purple flowers to obtain sum(G,Y+P). So, the values of G are G = S/T = X and Y + P = T \u2013 G, and purple flowers = 90% X = 0.9*X\nStep 5. Computing the sum of all the three colors of flowers.

After 2/5 or 100 tennis balls, I manage to hit 2/3 or 75 of the remaining 15 tennis balls. How many did I hit?\"\n\nFirst, assume these numbers are correct. Then, to know how many of the 175 tennis didn't Ralph hit, you need to know how many he did hit. Then, you just subtract the ones he did hit from the number of balls he loaded.

She now takes home $3,600 after the income increase, and the rent percentage has dropped to 25% ($850).\nStep 1: Break down the problem into its constituent parts. Mrs. Snyder used 40% of this income on rent and utilies, and the rest would go untouched. Now that she has an income increase of $600, rent takes up 25% and the rest goes toward her other expenses. \nStep 2: Substitute the facts in the problem into the formula. 40% of $3000 is equal to $1200, which is the old rent and utilities. Similarly, 25% of $3600 is the new rent and utilities which come to $900. \nStep 4: Write the formula for the given problem. 1200 = 0.40(3000) and, 900 = 0125(3600). Solving the equation, we get 3000 = 6750 and 3600 = 4500.

{"text": "The given information provides the number of skips completed by each person in 4 rounds. We need to calculate the number of times Jeff finished the competition, as well as the average number of skipping rounds completed by him in total.\n\nStep 1: Recall the information given. In all, there are 4 rounds of skipping competition.\nStep 2. Eliminate the choices that cannot be calculated. Any of the options that require extra information such as the number of skipping rounnds each person completed individually cannot be calculated. This includes A: No information given because the choices offered do not mention the total number of rounds completed by each person in the competition. B: Jeff skipped 16 less than Sam because they don't mention the number of rounds completed separately.\nStep 3: Choose the best answer. The correct answer choice is E: Jeff finished 7 rounds because he only finished 7 rounds out of the 12 rounds that Sam completed. This is true for all 4 rounds in the given options. Since Jeff did only complete 7 rounds, Jeff's average skipping count in each round would be 3.5 or 7/2.\nStep 4. Calculate the answer The number of skipping roudns is the sum of the skipping rounds completed. Therefore, we know that the total number of rounrs completed by both Sam and Jeff is 28. And Jeff's average skiing numbers in the 4 rounds is 3.5. Therefore, the number of skipping numbers to be completed is 7 which is the number of rounds Sam completes each round. \nSo the final answer of choices D is 7, Sam completes 16 more than Jeff. This is because Jeff finished 7 rounrs while Sam finished 28 rounds (Jeff's skipping count in each of the 4 rounds would be 3.6/7.5 so that each round is about the same number of rounds completed, thus, averaging 3.5 rounds). \nSo the final overall answer is 7, Sam Completes 16 rounds. \n\nInput: You arrive in a city with the most people who speak 4 languages, 1 million; people who speak 3 languages, 800 000; and", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "The problem states that the young girl poured 23 blue bead and 16 yellow ceads into a bowl. Then she divided the total into 3 parts and removed beads from each part to have 6 bead in each part.\nThe step of removing beads from each part is the major step that determines the right solution for this mathematical problem. It would make sense that she may remove 3 beads from each part of the bowl.\nIf we assume that the total number of beads poured into the bowl is 40 beads. Then, it would make more sense if she has 14 blue beads and 26 yellow beads left.\nAlso, if it is a 40-beaded bowl, you have 3 parts, with 6 beads in the 3rd part, then your result should be equal to what you've started with 40-3 = 37 beads left that can be divided to 6 beads in one part = 6x37/3 = 22 beads in 2 parts.\nTherefore, she had 40-3=37+22=59 beads.\nNote: The question does not mention that this is the case after she removed some beads from each of the three parts. \n\nInput: What is the temperature at - 33 \u00b0F?

The route has 2 different ways, a way of 105 miles and a way of 115 miles. \nStep 4: The trip started from point A to B (which is 55 miles), then drive back to point A (which is 10 miles further or 65 miles). \nStep D: The first question we have to solve is what time it took to drive from point A to B. Here, we can answer this question by using our understanding of work and efficiency.\nThe driver drove 55 miles which is 1 mile for 55 minutes. We can also represent it in the form of ratio i.e., (55 miles)/(1 mph. for a minute). As we have to find out the time involved in driving the first 55 miles, we will be using the denominator i.e., 1 mile for a minute instead of the numerator i.e., the total distance covered which is also 55 miles. \nFor 56 miles, it took 45 minutes which means the driver could have spent 1 hour on the way. \nSo it took 56 minutes instead of one hour, then the second question: To go back to where he started from, it took 19 minutes.\nStep E: For the second question, what time it took for the driver to go back to point A, which is 10 miles different from his starting point.\nStep 6: To the destination\nStep G: We can determine the duration of the whole journey or the tour with the second part of the question which asks for the answer in hours.

Second, 90 kilogram of grapes must be used in 6 months because we know that 20% of what's 90kg is 18kg and to get to this number, you need 62 days since 90 kilogrand is equal to 20% of 450 days.\nSince you increase your production by 20%, we assume that Borris decides to buy 1kg more of grapes.\nThird, we get that 9kg should be bought every 6 months instead of 90.\n\n4. Since Borris needs more grapes in a year, he also needs to buy some more grapes every six months to meet his production.\n5. After doing all the calculations above, we are left with figuring out how much grapes were produced in a year.\nWe need to multiply 9 kg with how many months were passed and then divide this number by 1000, since 1 kg equals 1000.

In other words, the car was bought back for more than the 80% value it was sold for previously.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the value of the car sold first.  It was sold for 8,000 bucks less than its actual value which equates to 80% of the car\u2019s value: 10,000 - 8,00 = 2,000 (80%).\nStep 2: Calculate the value acquired after purchase.

This means the cost could not be divided by 2 which is ruled out as an option. \n\nStep 03: Calculate the cost per group member with each share is now $5 more and the total of all groups' contribution is $350 dollars. The contribution of each group is $350 divided by the number of members in each group. For the original group of ten members, each group member contribution was $35 divided evenly by 10 making each group member's share was $3.5 dollars; similarly, for the group of 6 the total contribution of $580 divided by the number 6, so making the contribution of $90, while dividing by the number of original group members 10, each groups member contribute $9. That means the total contribution of the remaining 6 group members is $54. The amount each group member had to pay had increased by $8, so it became $5 and that's how the problem will be set up.\n\nStep 3: Analyse the information for each scenario. If splitting the gift equally, each group member paid $3(5). If one group member contributed $28 more, then each group member made had to pay $27 more and if two group members contributed the same $14 more, each group member had to contribute another $7 making their contribution $8 for each group member.\n\nStep 4: Evaluate whether it is possible or not. It can be seen in the 10 group scenario that the remaining 4 paid the same $3(5)$ as they did in the earlier group size. Now even if all six members of group contribute, there will still be $8 in addition to original cost, so there is no decrease in cost for the remaining group which the only option.\nStep 5. Solve to arrive on an answer. Now that the answer has been found, and using the given information, work backwards to set up the original problem. The remaining group now has an extra amount of $8.

Given information is Kimberley, Ela, & Houston collected firewood with Kimberly, Houston, and Ela collecting 10, 12, and 23 pounds of firewood respectively.\nStep 2A: To solve for Ela we will need to do the mathematical operations A = (T - S)/(A + B). In this case, to calculate Ela, we will take 10-12/35, to get an answer of Ela's pounds collected of firewood equal to 3/5 of 10 - 12/35 or 2/5 of 12/3. This simplifies to 2/15 pounds. We can express this as 2/15 = 0.1333 or the answer simply, is 0.13 pounds.\nSteps 2B: To verify the solution, subtract 2/15 from 35 and we get the remainder as 32, verify the remaining 32/32 = 1.

Therefore, we need to determine the number of boats that can race on one foot of the river. Step 2: Remember one foot divided by 3 is about 0.3 feet, meaning there are approximately 0.3 feet of room between adjacent boats if they are both 3 feet wide. Step 3: Eliminating the less likely options. It is highly unlikely there is a large boat that is 2 feet wide, so the answer would most likely be a factor of 0.3. Step 4: Consider two other factors. The first factor is that the boat must have 2 feet between it and the river bank. We need to calculate the number of feet that each boat occupies and the difference between the river bank and the river bottom in one of the boats. The second factor is that boats must be at least 2 feet apart so we can estimate how many boats are required to be present in the river based on this condition. \n\nStep 0: Consider the size of the river - the question specifically states the river is 42 feet wide Step 1: Identify the number of boats each boat is 3' wide and you want 2' of space between them - this results in 3 boats being 4' wide Step 2: Calculate the number of feet that is needed by each boat and the difference between the bottom of the river to the river bank. Example - The bottom of the river is 4' deep and the river bank is 6' high. The difference between the river base to the river bank is 10' with each boat needing 4' Step 3: Elimitating the less likely options - you can't have a boat on the river bank directly next to another boat which is 2' wide - it would need to be at least 4' from the river bank to the river bottom which would not fit in the river with 4 other boats Step 4: Consider the factor of how many boats are required and the factor of the two feet of separation between the boats - if you can squeeze 3 boats across a river which is 42' wide and 3' deep that is 26' wide, then 8 boats could fit in this situation based on our factor of 2 feet between", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "When we know the total amount of money owned by James is $40 above the total amount of money Ali owns, we can calculate James' amount of money using the equation (James' amount + 40) x (James % Ali) = Ali.\n\nStep 1: Determine the variables. In this case, we know that James owns more money than Ali, and we need to calculate how much more James owns than Ali.\n\nStep2: Find the missing information. In this case, the answer is the amount of money in James' possession.\n\nStep 3: Create an equation. To do this, we use the information provided in the question and form the equation (James' $ + 40) (James $ / Ali's $) = Ali. \n\nStep4: Solve for James' value. Once we have our equation, we can substitute values into the equation. In this case, James owns more than Ali, so we know that Ali must be smaller than James if James owns more than Li. By using algebra, the $ value is equal to (James) x 85/180, so the answer is in the range of $131 - $165. \n\nStep 5: Verify your answer. To verify your answer, you can check that the range is a real number, and the answer is a multiple of two, as the equation is multiplied by 2/3 to check the answer (or divided by 0.5 to check the answer).

{"text": "The key to solving this problem is to determine how much snow fell on each day and use this information to calculate the depth of the drift on the first day. To do this, we can first write down the equation for the depth of the drifting on the first day in an algebraic form:\n$d_1 = a_1(\\frac{1}{2}a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4)$, where $a_1$, $a_2$, $a_3$, and $a_4$ are the amount of snow that fell on each day and $d_1$ is the depth of the drifft at the end of the fist day.\nWe have the following values which can be substituted into the above equation to calculate the depth of drift on the first days:\nThe snowfall on the first day was 10 inches, which can be represented as $a_1$. The second day snowfall was 8 inches, which can be denoted as $a_2$. The third day snowfall was 12 inches, which can be expressed as $a_3$. The fourth day snowfall was 20 inches, which can  be characterized as $a_4$.\nSo, in the equation: $d_1 = a_{1}(\\frac{1}{2}(10 + 8 + 12 + 20) +\\frac{5}{2}(10) = 16(\\frac{3}{2}(7 + 4) +\\frac{1}{2}) = 9(\\frac{11}{2} +\\frac{2}{2}) = 2^{\\frac{11}{4}}$ = 30.83\n\n\nIn conclusion, 20 inches of additional snowfall and a half of the previous snowfall melted on the second day and another 6 inches fell on the third day of the storm.

This can be determined by considering the following\nStep 1: It is given that gazelle starts the race at a speed of 40 mph (g), and the cheetah wants to catch up with it. For him to catch up, he needs to run at a speed of c, which means he can't be running slower than the speed of the gazelle.\nStep 2.

The gazelle is 210 ft and the cheetah is still running at a speed of 50 ft, this means that it will take 13 seconds for the cheetah to cover the first 212 feet and then he will have to run at a speed faster than the gazelle to reach the gazelle, we will call this speed that of gm+.\nStep 2.2. Since the cheetah is running at speeds of gm +, and gazelle is running at g, to start the race at gm +.

Choices:  ZYx  AZN  ABK  TUV  QWO\nOutput: Since the whole alphabet is considered, it's safe to assume the odd one out does not exist in any language. In particular, the odd one out should not exist in an English alphabet. \n\nIn the English alphabetic order of words, letters that sound the same or are pronounced the same are considered to be the same letters. For example, \u201cc\u201d, \u201ck\u201d, and \u201cgh\u201d are considered the same, yet they are treated as three different letters. Therefore, the odd one out, if any, need not follow the English alphabetical order.\n\nStep 1: First, exclude the letter \u2018O\u2019 as it is not considered \u2018A\u2019, \u2018Z\u2019 or \u2018X\u2019. \n\nStep 2: Now, exclude the pair \u2018Q\u2019 and \u2018W\u2019 as these letters are commonly accepted as pronounced the same or sounding the same, even though they are technically different letters. Thus, a letter pair does not qualify as the odd one out.\n\nStep 3: Now, only two letters are left standing, since all the other options have been confirmed.\n\nTherefore it can be concluded that the odd one out in the English alphabet is TUV. It is not part of the \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019, \u2018D\u2019, \u2018E\u2019, \u2026 \u2018Z\u2019 sequence, nor is it a combination of two letters which sounds the same or is pronounced the same in English.\n\nSo the final answer from the list is TUV: is odd one out\n\nInput:The boss called a meeting of just one hour's duration.

What if there's a yellow traffic light immediately in front? Choices: \nOutput: Given that the speed of the car is 20m/sec, and light is taken as 3*10^8 m/sec. A 0-yellow light would take the car, from 0 to 3*10^-2 seconds because a car from a red light can see the green light, but has to brake. But a 0-yellow light, for the car to stop has less time. A 0-green light will take the car to 0-3 seconds. So the car must have 18 seconds. So the correct answer is C: 18", "answer": " 39"}
{"text": "Let's start by calculating the perimeter. P = 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 inches So now we need to figure out the area. To find the area, multiply the perimeter by itself. In the formula A = P^2 Now, we can solve for P^2 by subtracting P from both sides. This gives us P^2 = 12^2 = 144 Now take the square root of both sides. Root = sqrt(144) =12 = 12 inches^2.\nSo the area of the rectangle would be (5 inches^2) Which is what was given earlier in the question.\nSo the finals answer is A: 5 inches^2.\n\nInput: If you divide 725 into an arbitrary number a, then the quotient ( a 725 ) is even, find a.\nOutput: Solution: 725 goes into 1, 3, 5, 7, 13, 21, 29, 35.... 725 goes exactly 7 times! Therefore a(725)=70.  100 100 150 200 225 250 etc. can't be 70 but can be all divisible numbers up to 999. \nSince a can only be an increasing number, in order to get 70 you would start at 100 and keep dividing 7 times. In total the value would have to be 70 so the final answer would be 100. \nSo the answer is 100.", "answer": " 44"}

So this means x square is either 250 or equal to 75 an hour for times 8 (eight) is either 625 or 200. So, we just have to do an elimination here and we see that x is equal to 28. Now, in order to write the pair of shoes, we have 75 an hour times 8 (eights). So we have an output of 600. And then, of course, we have to do a second elimination to get x again, which we now know as 28. 28 + x times 200 is 540.

Yola's weight, 220 lb. -(18 lb - 8 lb = 9 lb)\n\nThis means Yola weighs (9lbs x 80 = 720lbs) lb more than 18 lb = 738 lb\n\nThus, Yola weighs 0 lb x (738/720) = 0.99 x lb + 720 lb = 2 lb\n\nStep 3: Solve for Wanda's weight:\nSince Wanda weighs -12 - (yola) + (220 - yola),\n\n1 lb = 144 x 18 + (220-18) = 1424 lb - 2 lb,\n\nWanda's weight 1 lb = 136 x 18 + 2 lb = 220\n\nTherefore, we can deduce that Wanda's weight is 220 lb, and Yola weighs  0 lb.\n\nStep 4: Check your answer:\n\n12-12 = 0 lb\n\nWanda'sw eeight is 220 and therefore\n\nWanda'squ + yola=' qu = +240 and\n\nWanda'ss w= x + y = 320\n\nSo, Yola's weight is 0 lb\n\nThus the answer is that Wanda weighs\n\nAs such, the correct answer is (C) Wanda weighs is 220 lbs.\nSo the final  answer is C: W", "answer": " 170"}
{"text": "Step 0: Define variables. We assume that the variable representing chickens is C. We also know that the number of chickers must always equal C. Step 1: Solve the equation with one variable. Set C = 4. Four equals the initial number, i.e. no change in the initial number of chickens.\nStep 2. Solve the equation with multiple variables. The equation will be (C - 1) = 4 + C. We can factor it, setting C - 1 = (2 + 4) for the first term, and C as the second term.\nStep 3: Solve the equation as 2. Now let's solve the equation for C2. We substitute 2 for C in the terms, setting (C2 - 1) = (2 + 2), then solving 21 = 4, which equals 4. Therefore, C2 = 4, the only number that can be equal to 4 when C is equal to 2.\nStep 4. Solve the equation as a fraction. We multiply both sides by 2, thus, (C2 - 2 = 4. We know C2 = 4 must equal 4. Thus, subtracting 2 from C2 = 2. We multiply both sides of the equation by 2. Now subtracting 2 from the left side gets us 2. Next, we multiply both sides of the original equation by 2. The equation now reads (4 - 2) = 4.\nStep 5. Use commutative algebra to solve the equation. The equation reads 2 = 4 - 2. We can swap two terms, giving 2 - (2 - 2) = -2. We then solve the fraction (-2/2) = -1. Solving for fractional results means that (-2/2) converts into -1.\nStep 6. Solve the equation without substitution. Multiply both sides of the equation to get (C2/2) = 1. We know C2 and C2 = 4. Substituting the numerator of 4 into 4/2 results in 4 = 4 so that C2 = 4 makes no sense. Substituting C2 = 4 into C2/2 gives us 4/2 = 1, converting it to", "answer": " 13"}

However, there is a discount coupon that can be redeemed for an instant discount or a cash reimbursement of $4 per person towards the bill. \n\nThis provides the necessary information to calculate how much each person will need to contribute to the meal. Here, we can apply the following formula to solve the problem: A = B - D, where A is the share a person contributes towards the meal bill, B is the total cost of the meal without taking into account the coupon, and D is the total discount that each person gets through the coupon. \n\nIn the given situation, the total cost of the dining bill without the discount (B) comes to $67. As each person gets a $4 discount, the total discounts that the three people get comes to $12, which means the total bill without the discount is $67-$12 = $55.

We know that there are 10 boxes left and Arnel shares the remaining pencils of each box evenly among 5 friends.\nStep 2 : So, each of his friends gets 8/10(boxes left).\nStep 3: Arnel is left 3 pencils because he kept 10 pencil, and there are 10 pencili\nStep 4: The number of pencils remaining in each box is 9/10 times number of boxes left.\nSo, let me write 4.5 as 4.5 pencil remains. So pencils remaining in 1st box = 4.5, pencils remaining in second box = 4.4, third box = 4.3 and fourth box = 4.2\nStep 5: Arnel is left five pencils, so the total number of pencils present in 10 boxes = 20 + 10*9/10.

Jennifer purchases an extra 6 cans for every 4 cans that Mark brought home from the store. \n\nIn this scenario, there are 4 main steps to answer this question:\nStep 1: Calculate the difference in number of cans purchased by Mark and Jennifer, which is 6 because for every 4 can purchases by Mark, Jennifer buys an extra 2 cans of milk, while for every 5 can purchases by Mark Jennifer buys an additional 6 cans of milk. In total, Jennifer ends up buying an additional 6 can of milk for every 5 can mark has purchased. \n\n\nStep 2: Use the information calculated in step 1 to calculate the number of cans bought by Mark i.e. the number of cans of milk brought home by Mark. If Mark bought 50 cans of milk, that would mean that the extra 6 cans of each 5 cans that Jennifer brought home from the store would be an additional 30 cans. So if Mark brought home 50 cans it means Jennifer brought home at least 30 additional cans. This can be concluded by the fact that Jennifer brought home an extra 6 can of milk, for every 4 can mark brought home = 15 can of milk = 30 can of milk.\nSo Mark brought home at least 15 cans of milk additional to the number bought by Jennifer. \n\nStep 3: Use the information calculated previously to further calculate the number of can of milk brought home by both Mark and Jennifer. We first multiply by 6, meaning that 6 extra cans of milk are purchased by Mark each 5 cans. This implies buying an extra 3 cans per can. If Mark bought 4 cans of milk then Jennifer bought 6 extra cans. If Mark bought 3 cans and Jennifer bought 6 cans, then Mark bought 1 can and Jennifer bought 3 cans.

{"text": "This question is asking how much money James would make from selling all of the water he collects during two days of rain if he sells it at a rate of $1.2 per gallery and each inch of rain is equivalent to 15 gallons of water.\n\nHere is how to solve the problem:\nStep 1: Identify the key information in the question. This includes James' rain barrel, the amount of rain, and the amount of money he can make by selling the rain water. \nStep 2: Solve the problem. First determine how many gallons of water James would get from both days of rain. The answer would be 84 gallons (15 x 4 + 15x3). Then convert the question into a money problem by determining how much each gallon would cost and how many gallons could be sold before they would all be sold. Each gallon of water costs 1.2 dollars so 84 gallons of water cost 102.40 (84 x 1.2).  Then the question asks how much money is made from selling all the rainwater so we need to determine how much the money made would be.  We need to convert gallons to dollars here as each dollar is equivalent to 0.083 gallons. Then we need to find the total amount of dollars James received by finding the product of the number of gallons sold and the price per gallon. This would be 84 x 0.08 = 6.72 dollars. Thus, James makes a profit of 6.72 ($6.72). This is the answer.\nSo the final solution is: James collects a rainwater barrel (84 gallons) on Monday and Tuesday and makes a profit of $6.72. \n\nInput: The pizza is made.

{"text": "To calculate the total number of photo in the family gallery, we can look at the pattern of the photos taken. We know that Lilah's family took half as few photos on the first day than they have in their whole gallery. So, we can think of this as 0.5 as a multiplier for their gallery. Similarly, we know that they took 120 more on the second day. This means we can think of taking this as 1.2 as a multiplier for the gallery. \n\nFrom there, we can multiply 0.5 x the number of photos they took on the first few to determine the number of photos that should be in the gallery. We can also multiply 1.2 to determine the number of additional photos they will take on the second day. After that, the number of photos that each day should have is multiplied by the sum of both multipliers. The answer will be (0.5 x 400) + 120 = 240. \n\nTherefore, we can conclude that the total number of photos the family's gallery will have after their trip is 240.

There are three types of pitching machines, which are: 1. Flight pitcher 2. Pitching mat 3.

The owner of the restaurant ordered all the meat in four pound packages and there are three butcher. Two options and solutions will be given along with steps taken.\nStep 1: Determine the number of packages delivered by each butcher. By dividing the total weight by the weight of a single package, we can determine the number of packages delivered. The total weight of the three butchers of ground beef is 100 pounds and the weight of the package of ground beef 10 pounds. Thus, we have divided 100 by 10 and found that each butcher delivered 11 packages. Therefore, each butcher delivered 40 packages of 10 pounds (11*40).\nStep 3: Identify the remaining quantity of ground beef from the third butcher. To determine how many packages the third butcher delivered, subtract the total weight of the second butcher from the total weight of all three butchers. In this case, since the second butcher delivered 14 packages, the third butcher had to deliver at least the remaining packages (21-14) to reach the total weight of all the packages. In the question, 14 packages were already accounted for, so the final package would have been 6 units.\nStep 5 (the most important thing): This is the trickier part, given that at this point your answer of 6 packages is not enough to make sense given the information provided.

What we have here are 3 different bouquets of carnelion flowers, each of which has various quantities of flowers. \n\nThere are several ways to approach this question, but a sensible approach is to: \n\n1) Start by finding a common denominator. The word \u201cbunch\u201d is used to describe a specific number. As a result, if you want to find the quantity of flowers in any particular bunch of carnelions, you must know how many you have, not as a quantity of carnelion flower, but as a quantity of one unit of measure. \n\n2) So next, find the common denominator. In the first bunch of carnelion flowers there are 9 carnations. That is equivalent to the carnation. \n\n3) Next, we find the denominator and numerator of each of the bunches of carnations and we find the average. In the second, there are 14 carnelion flowers, while there are 13 in the third. \n\nIf the common denominator is 1, the average is 8.5.\n\n4) So 8.5 is the average carnelion bunch contained in these bouquets.\nSo the final average is 8. \n\nAnswer: What is the average number in the carnelion bunches?

The first is that the elevator takes one minute to ride up, and one minute to ride down. Another important detail is that there is a maximum of 10 people that can ride the elevator at one time. \n\nStep: Using these details, the only way the ten people can be on the elevator in an hour is if they take turns riding up and down. \n\nStep2 When taking turns riding up and then down, 10 people could ride up and 10 people could come down. In one hour, there would be a total of 40 opportunities to take the elevator. \n\nStep3 Eliminate each possibility. 15 isn't divisible by 4, so we can cross it off as an option. \n\nStep4 Consider the remaining options. 23 is the closest we can get because we have the minimum number of possibilities and the maximum number of possibilities.

Next, Punger wants to protect the cards in special pages, so he needs at least 10 pages to put all cards in the pages as baseball pages are able to hold 10 cards each. Therefore, he needs 6 packs in each page, and he needs at least 7 pages for 7 cards in each page.\nSo we can assume that each page contains at least 7 cards. We cannot determine the exact number as the data is not explicit about the number of pages needed. As 10 pages can hold 7 cards each, he will need 70 additional pages for 70 additional cards.

The key equations to write down are: F: Two ounces of oil F: Eight ounces of peans N: Eight ounse of peans V: Weight of the peanut butter\nStep 2: Eliminate the equations you would not use. The following step is to check which of the equations will not be applicable and remove them. (There\u2019s not much room for error here since the number of steps is limited and the given information is fairly specific.) The only applicable equation that remains is V: Weight of peanut buter.\nStep 3: Simplify the equation. There tends to be some trial and error in this step. In this scenario, the weight of the peanut-butter being 20 ouns is the only part of the equation that should be altered. Based on this, one can derive that F: 6 ounces of oil is needed to achieve the ratio of F: two ounces of ounse of oil\nStep 4: Substitute and simplify. Now, two ouns of oil is an easy measurement to substitute, as it is a specific amount measured in ounces. To add on, eight ounces of pepans is an easy measurement to substiutie using the same method. So, the equation is V: F-E. Once the equation has been simplified, the remaining step is to plug and chug. It helps to keep a record of all the measurements in real life and use the same units for a consistent approach. After all the calculations, it\u2019ll be helpful to write down the resulting equation and solve for the number of ounces of oil. In this scenario, it would be helpful to use the method of eliminating fractions. The resulting equation should be 20 V: 6 ounse. To solve, an exponent is used to move the decimal. Substituting and simplifying the equation, one can conclude that 20 ounse of oil was used.\nSo the final Answer is E: Eight ounes", "answer": " 4"}

There are nine people total, of which eight are children (average weight = 60 pounds each) plus one adult (average = 120 pounds). In addition, three adults each weigh 120 pounds and two children each weigh 60 pounds, which adds a combined weight of 240 pounds. \nSo the load capacity is 600 + 240 = 840 pounds.\nStep3: Eliminate less likely answers. Adding a passenger will not surpass the load capacity if the total weight of the passengers is less than 840 pounds, so A: 2 adults and 3 children and B: 4 children and 5 adults can be eliminated because these are the only passengers that would add a total weight less than 844 pounds.\nStep 4 and 5: To find the possible weight of the next passenger, 840 pounds will have to be divided be 85 or less passengers, where 85 is the maximum possible passengers. 840 / 85 = 0.9739089, so the maximum weight of the load capacity is 973.9 pounds.\nSo the final and final answer is C:974 lbs.\nSo the final step is C: 974 lbs\n\nInput: How many different 5 digit numbers are there?\nA: 10(5!)\nB: 5!(5!)\nC: 4!(9!)\nD: 3!\nOutput: The question requires calculating the different 5-digit numbers that can be formed given that the digits 0 - 9 can be chosen. \nStep 1: Identify that there are five different options of numbers to choose from for the number of combinations.\nStep 2 to Step 4: Determ", "answer": " 52"}

But a jacket is made up of other items like sleeves, pockets and buttons. So how much does the entire jacket cost? By dividing the given price by the cost of each of the jacket\u2019s parts we can find the value of that part of the jacket. Jacket cost = $80 \u00f7 3 = $26.67. The price of a jacket then, is $26.66+ the cost of each of its parts. So, a jacket is sold for $113.33.\nSince Kevin wants to buy some items on sale, the price of the jackets needs to be deducted and that leads to a discount deduction. The discount is equal to the percent of the new price minus 1, so the discount is equal to 90% - 1 or 9%. 10% disc out of 80$ means 8$ discount on every jacket. \nThe price of a jacket on sale is then 113.34- 8=$105.34. The additional 5$ is tax.\nKevin has bought 6x T-shirts which means each shirt is selling at 8$ each.

However, considering the amount of the student's earnings, it doesn't add up. Therefore, Option C can be ruled out. \n\nOption D: The shoes cost at least $527. It's possible, but this price range is too wide, and a specific answer is required. In addition, this option implies that the student has the required amount of money for the shoes. However, the problem does not specify that. \n\nOption G: The shoes cost least $681.75. Like Option D, the price is too high and the required amount of money is too less. Therefore, Option D can be eliminated. \n\nUsing the remaining options to determine the price, $533.25 appears to be the most plausible choice. \n\nThis is because it is close to the price $527.00 mentioned in Option C and is also within the bounds of $528.00 - $530.00, which are the minimum and maximum limits given in the question. \n\nThe option of $533.75 and $530.25 is also reasonable since they are close to $533.00 but still within the given range.\n\nTherefore the least price possible for the shoe is $533.

{"text": "This question requires calculations with multiplication and division involving fractions and whole numbers. \n\nOne common strategy is to convert the fraction number into a decimal form. For example, to convert 24/48 to a decimal, divide the numerator by the denominator to get 0.5.\nThe total number of erasers after conversion to fraction form is 480.\n\nMultiply the amount raised by the total number of eraser to calculate the revenue. \n\nStep 1: The student council sells scents erasers in the mornings before school, so to convert this into a math problem.\nStep 2. This involves the knowledge of erasers and a rough estimate of a student body which implies 400 is a good number to base the answer on. \nStep 2. After finding the number of students in the student body we multiply it by $0.75(the sale price) giving us 2.25.\nStep 3. This question is asking us how much money will be made if the students sell $0.75 erasers in total. There would be 300 erasers sold based on the student body size of 400.\nStep 4. To proceed to the step of multiplying revenue by the number of erasers. \nStep 4. The number of erasers is 400 which is one digit past four or an exponent is used when multiplying 400 by 300.\nStep5: In order to solve this question you divide $0.75 by the 300 eraser.\nStep 5. Dividing 0.75 by 300 gives us a fraction 0.025 which as you multiply by $0.7 we get a total of $0.189625.

So, in this problem, the answer is a: eat up. \n\nThe problem is asking to compare the types of ice cream. There are only two options for what happens when we want to eat up ice cream types. Eating up an ice cream and say is very weird and no one does that to eat the ice cream or even the say with ice cream is not a good way to consume the food. So, the second option in the choices is a: eat up is the one which is accepted by all. \nNow, to continue the pattern for what happens to the ice cream types, if one say like chocolate ice cream, then how many ice cream types are remaining? There are only three options for what is left after eating up any ice cream type which are black, blue, purple. Among them, only blue is different from the previous ones. Therefore, in the next ice cream type, there will only be one type of remaining ice cream type and in the third type of remaining ice creams, there will be none left.

There are no bricks of snow used on the outside.\nStep 4 Consider the remaining options. Total possible options for the count of bricks used is 12 through 14 = 16. The answer is most-likely to be 12 bricks. Considering the number of rows of brick snow used the bottom of the igloo and the top of the igloo, the total number of bricks of snow used is 216. There are a total of 16 bricks used in the bottom half of the iclome with 96 bricks used in then top half of the igroi.

This is calculated as follows: 1 carrot * 365 days = 5.5 carrots\n\nStep 2: Solve for the quantity of carrots fed in the year which represents the quantity of carroten eating by Harris each day.\n\nThe number carroten eaten by Harris\u2019 dog in a single day is derived by dividing 1 pound of carroten by the number of days in a month.   This is calculated as:5.5 carroten / 365 = 0.01538 carrots\n\nWe can verify our results by dividing the total number of carrots consumed each year by Harris by the number of carroterns per bag to derive the cost.   The equation to calculate it is:       $2 x number of carroten in a year / number of carroten per bag = 2 * 0.0104 x $2 or   $2 x 0.0115 / $2   = $0.023\n\nApplying the appropriate calculations, we can conclude that Harris will spend or spend a total of $2.04 in carrots each year. \nSo the final answer here is $2.04\n\nInput: Why didn't the monkey get to see his best friend?

As such, this means using one of two methods: (i) Adding beans to the jar to make the overall total a number \"larger than six beans\"; or (ii) Subtracting the total number of beanz from a larger number of beans. (i) To ADD to the jar: 1. Consider the number of beans currently contained in the jar. 2. If the current number of beans is \"below\" 6, one can simply ADD as many beans to the total as necessary to reach 6.  However, if 6 beans are already contained in the jar, it becomes \"more difficult\" to ACTUALLY \"add\" to the jar. One cannot merely ADD anymore beans, since this would only make it \"more\" than 6, but nowhere close to 7.

{"text": "For this question, there are various steps we need to follow for arriving at a solution. The question presents various components of a transaction in which we need to find how much money each member of the dining team is paying for two different meals. Let's understand the steps in detail.\nStep 1 - We need to find what each person is paying for the two different meals.\nStep 2 \u2013 The next step is to break down the total expense into individual parts. In this example, total bill is $32 and tip is 0.20x(till 3 d.p) = 0.80x.\nStep 3 - This step is to determine how many people are sharing the costs. In this case, both the men are sharing the costs in which we have 2 meals and 2 people.\nStep 4 - Add the expense and total expense (i.e. $37).\nStep 5 - Now, this step is to calculate the share of each person on the expense they are paying to the restaurant. In this example, James's contribution to the bill is $4.95 and his friend's is $37.05. This means James is paying for $4.95 while his friend is paying for $37.04.\nStep 6 - The final part is calculating the total amount for each person. In this case, the total bill and tip is $37 and James is paying $4.95 which means $4.95 + $37 = $41.95. For his friend, the total bill and 20% tip ($4.90) is $41.90.\nStep 7 - The final step is to subtract total expense from total bill and then add the tip. In this case, $16+$14+$20=36-$37=$-1. \nSo James is paying $-$1. \nSo, the answer is A:-1\n\nInput: If a tree falls in the forest, does it make a sound if no one is around?

{"text": "Step 1: Identify the characteristics of the problem statement. The problem statement refers to the number of students that this school can accommodate where everyone has their own desks. We can see that there are two options presented\u2014to have 30 or 25 desks per classroom. Therefore, every student must get his or her own desk. We are also informed that 1/3 of the classrooms have 3 desks per classroom whereas the rest have 2 desks per classroom.\nStep 2: Decompose the problem statement. It may help to first write the information in a logical order. The statement may be decomposed as such: a school has 15 different classrooms. One-Third of these classrooms have a certain number of desks and the rest have a different number of desks. 1/3 of these desks have 3 desks and the rest of the desks have 2 desks each. Therefore, we know that everyone gets their own desks, and we can identify the total possible seats available in all the classrooms.\nStep 3: Solve the problem. Identify the criteria. The information above will help us identify the criteria that help solve the problem. To put it simply, the only criterion in the problem is that everyone gets their own seat. To solve the problem, we use the information and rules to figure out how many seats can be accommodated for one student at a time. Step 4: Identify all the possible seats. For each classroom that has 3 desks, we can accommodate 3 students. The rest of the classrooms can accommodate 2 students each. \nStep 5: Identify the total number of seats available to accommodate students. Thus, from the above data, we can conclude that a school can accommodate a total of 45 students given that everyone gets their own seats.\nTherefore, the answer is 45 students.

{"text": "The math problem requires some thinking to solve.\nTo start, assume a part cost $10, and the discount is 10%, so the actual price would be $90. \nTo solve, it is necessary to set up an equation with the known values. The discount can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100 to convert to %. Since we do not have this value but need to know it to solve for it, we will put it into our equation as x. \nOur equation will then be: Clark multiplied by the discount x and gets 35. Then Clark divided that by 7 and gets 5. However, from the above equations, we can now calculate the discount to be: $439 - 0.1 = $0.439. Therefore, our final equation would be: Clark multiplied the discount times x, gave it back to us seven times which would be 5, and then subtracted an extra $0.436. Therefore the value that would make the above equation true is a discount of $0.44. \nSo the final answer: The discount can be calculated to be $0.44\n\nInput: A cowboy drives 15 miles into a town.

{"text": "The question asks how many more wings must be eaten per minute to beat Kevin\u2019s record? \n\nStep1: Consider the context of the question. Kevin has been able to eat 64 hot wings in 8 mins which means he ate approximately 2 hot wings a minute. If Alan, a boy who aims to beat Kevin\u2019s previous record, wants to maintain the same record, he must consume 5 hot wings in 1 minute. That means, if Alan increases his hot wings consumption by 3, thus 3 hot wings per minute, it would result in him being able to beat Kevin\u2019s world record. \n\nStep 2: It is also important to note that the number of hot wings Kevin ate in each minute was not specified, but rather they are assumed to be approximately 2. \n\nStep3: Thus, we can conclude that Alan must eat 3 more hot wings per minute to beat Kevin, thus making his total consumption to be 8 hot wings in 1 min. That makes the solution C. \n\nSo the final answer to this question is C: 8\n\nInput: If you are cooking hamburgers on a grill, do you leave the lid open to allow the grease to drain into the fire?

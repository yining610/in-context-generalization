Option A is not the correct answer because an easier lift would be one with less weight lifted or one with less overall effort.\n2. Option B is not the correct answer either because the total weight lifted (20 pounds) may be less than the total weight lifted (100 pounds), but greater force is required to lift 100 pounds and therefore, it is more difficult.\n3. Option C is not the correct answer since weight lifting is less difficult in the later rounds of the competition if 100 pounds is harder than 50 pounds.\n4. The answer is Option D. The heavier the weight, the more difficult it is to pick up, regardless of how much one is able to pick it up; therefore, it is \"easier\" to pick up a 20-pound weight since greater force is not required from one's muscles.\nSo the final choice is D.

{"text": "The question asks for total weight in pounds.  The box started at a weight of zero and went up from there, so there is no reason to start counting from another value (like half).\n1. Using the method listed above, the first step is to find out how much food is in the box (6 pounds).\n2. We cannot just use weight in pounds because there are many things that change the weight, so we can use net weight in pounds.\n3. Then, divide the total number of jelly beans (60) by 6.4 and multiply it by 2 for each jelly beans, and do so for each brownies.\n4.

How many seconds does it take for the car to slow down and reach 60 mi/hr from 80 mi/hr.\nOutput: 1, As can be seen in the graph, the maximum speed of the car is 80 mi/hour.\n2. The car's acceleration (or deceleration) is also evident from the graph: it slows down to 60 mi/hour in t seconds (t < 0 or t > 5).\n3. Then, since for any change in t to a negative value, the situation is represented by subtracting the values (or the opposite action), 60 \u2212 t = \u2212t.\n4. This is represented by the x and y axis; x is the change in direction, while y is the speed.\n5. Therefore, x \u2212 60 = \u2212t which can be represented with the expression 70 \u2212 t.\n6. Therefore it takes exactly 70 seconds from being at 80 mi/second to reach 60 mi.\n7. Finally, from 80 mi \u00d7 70 seconds = 5600 mi or 3000 mi/s, the minimum speed at", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "1.) This is a very straight forward problem to solve.\n2.) Our first solution is to look at the profit. $2000 is what he made to make the movie and each DVD costs $6 to make. So our cost to make each DVD is $6. We already said he sells it for twice the cost to make it so our revenue is $12. We also know he sold 500 of them so we multiply that time the revenue to get our profits or sales from the movies. So 500 x $12 = $6000 - $3000 = $3000 profit.\n3.) The next thing to find out is how much he sold in 20 weeks. So 50 x 4 = 200 and we multiply that answer by our profit from the first problem ($3000) which is $600,000.\n4.)

{"text": "1) Let us think back to how bonus decisions are approached in reality.  Someone might have the option to earn more money or work more hours.  Many people choose to work more hours.  Why is that?  In many circumstances, it is not because they simply prefer to work (many would rather take a day off at the beach); it is because a choice to work more hours comes with a side benefit.  It is the side benefit that compels the choice to work an hour more - a better hourly wage is a common side benefit.  The question above asks you to find the new hourly wage for John if he decides to work an extra hour to get the performance bonus.\n2) John makes $80 a total of four hours every day, not over eight (we need to add the two hours back at the end to his total).\n3) Let's write the expression of how much John makes each day: $80 / 4 = $20 per four hours.\n4) He can earn $20 for his performance bonus if he agrees to work 8 hours a day.\n5) John would then be earning $20 per 8 hours ($80 over 4 hours), which works out to be $125 per day.\n6) This is a different way of rearranging the math, but to find out how much John makes per hour, divide 125 by 8.\n7) The result is $15 per hour.\nSo the final\n\nInput: We used to read more newspapers, now we watch more television.

The museum and zoo both cost $10 to enter.  In addition, they both cost $.50 to park at, and there is a $50 flat rate for each activity.  The museum has lots of things to see for free. It contains five free halls.  The zoo has two free halls.  One of these halls requires an entrance pass to get in.

They agree that $100 will be enough for them to spend if they visit either one of the institutions.  If they decide to go to the museum, they will be able to fit everything they want to see in the day, but it will be expensive to park at.

{"text": "1) The first part of the question asks John to buy a piano.  Since he buys it and we know its price (500), we can't say the price is what he spent on it.  Instead, it should be the total cost which would be what he spent to buy the piano.  \n2) The second part of the question states that he hires a teacher.  In this case, we can assume that John has to pay for the teacher as he is getting paid.  Therefore, we should subtract $200 or 20% (since he gets a 20% discount for 20 lesson) from the first part (i.e. 500).  This gives us the cost he spends on the 1st 10 lessons in this part.  We assume he gives it to the teacher and doesn't keep $100 ($500 - $400) to himself.  The other option would be to subtract $25 ($40 - $35), giving him total cost of $100+$100+$25=$225. So we are left with choosing which answer is correct.\n3) The last part shows the sum of total cost of piano and the cost he spends in hiring a teacher. He spent $300 total for the piano and 20 lessons.  \nHence, total cost = piano cost+ (hiring cost-$200) = 500+$200-$200 = $300 +$200=$500. Since, we know that he got a 25% (i.e. $200) discount on hiring a teacher, he ended up paying $300+$40+$10=$450 in total. So if you subtract 300 from the last part, you get $150, which is wrong. So the correct answer should be $500.\nSo the final cost of everything is $500 since it includes total price of piano and the cost of hiring a teacher\n\nInput: Which is larger, $30 per week, or $100 for the year?\nOutput: $100\nSo the larger one is $100\n\nInput: 3 times as", "answer": " 1100"}

{"text": "1. The question asks for the number of days it will take one single amoeba to go through its own lifecycle and divide into 16 distinct amoebas. Based on the clues, it is possible to work out a pattern to relate the lifespan of the amoeba and the number of division cycles.\n2. An amoebae reproduces by fission every two days. This means that the amoeba divides into two separate amoobea each time its lifespan is completed.\n3. We can therefore calculate the number of days it would take one amoebae to fission into 16 amobea as follows:\n4. If one amoebae reproduced by fission on days 1, 3, 5,... until day 15, then by day 16, the amoeba would have gone through 16 cycles of fission, with each cycle taking one day.\n5. As each cycle of fission occurs every two days, by day 16 there are 8 cycles. So there is one amoeba reproducing every 17.5 days, which is every 3.625 days for 16 cycles, which is every 130.8125 days (i.e. 2^6), i.e. 160 days. \nSo the final answer the number of days is 160", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "1. This question requires more than a simple linear relationship, because the rate of leaf falling is not consistently constant. A linear relationship assumes that the rate of change is constant; if we assume a linear relationship with this question, the rate of change would be 4+7 at the beginning but change to just 4 at the end.\n2. Instead, I recommend using the rule of 72, which states that the ratio to 72 is a reasonable prediction of how many years it will take something to double.\n3. By considering the initial rate (4) and a prediction of the average rate over 3 hours based on the rule of 71 (4*71/3), we can see that the average rate is approximately 1 per hour. This allows us to interpret the data and calculate the average rate of leaf falling.\n4. Because the question is about the average number of leaves falling per hour, we don't care about whether the number of leaves falling in each hour is large. Therefore, we can ignore the initial rate and only focus on the average rate of leaf fall. \n5. So the final answer is 1.05. \n\nInput:It is known that every positive integer greater than one is a factor of some integer less than itself.  Is it true that every positive integer greater or equal to two is a factor of either itself or one? Choices: A: no B: yes C: yes\nOutput:1. Because this number does not depend on whether we look at all negative or all positive integers. One can assume all negative integers have a factor that is not one, because otherwise we cannot divide these numbers by themselves. Similarly, one can assume all positive integers have a factor that isn't themselves, because we cannot divide these numbers to one.\n2. For all given integers, we cannot just conclude that they are factors of one. That logic does not follow from the original statement, because you cannot assume some properties based on what you are trying to determine.\n3. What is true is that every positive integer greater and equal to two is a multiple of neither one nor itself.\n4. If we look at a different question involving integers that do not include the factor one, then we would not be able to conclude that every positive integer greater, but not equal to two is a prime factor.\n\nInput:Ren, Sora, and Drew are in the same class at their college.", "answer": " 5"}

Thus, each flash light is viewed from a 1000ft distance.\n3) We now know the distance between the two flash lights. We then notice that Veronica's light is seen in a distance 1/3 the distance away from Freddie's light than the distance from Freddie's to Velma's. This is because the difference between the distances of the two flash lights should be less than that of all the flash lights (distance between Veronica's and Freddie's and distance between Freddie's and Velma): 1/3 < (x - y) < 2/3\n4) If Velma's flash light is 5 times farther away than Veronica's light, Velma's distance should be the distance between Veronica's to Freddie's and the distance between Freddie'd to Velma. We know that Velma's distance must be positive and less than 2000.\nBecause: 1. ( 2000 + 3000)/2000 = 3/2 < 2.25 < 5/2\nThus, the distance of Velma's light should be around 3,200 + 2,150 feet.\n5) From this we can see that Velma's light is 3,204ft farther away from the light turned on by Veronica.\n6) So 3,208 ft < 3040 ft + 3204 ft.\nThus, Velma's light can be seen from 1000 ft away from where Veronica's light can be viewed: 3204 > 3000.\nTherefore, Veronica's flash lights can be seen at night from 1004 ft away.\nSo the final anwer is 1004\n\nInput: The difference between \"The Dress\" and \"Catan's Cube\" for the top three most popular TikTok", "answer": " 12,000"}

We can assume that the question means that Josh will use the ribbon equally as we are told that each gift will use 1/6th of the ribbon.\nThis means that he will use up 2/6ths or a total of 33/6ths or 5 1/6ths of the ribbon. \n2.) The question then asks how many 1/6th's of the ribbon will be left.\nTo calculate this, we need to take the number of 1/6th (or 5 of the 18 yards) and divide it by 5. This gives us 2/6th\n3.) Then, we need to get 2/6th of the remaining. We know that we will have 5 1/5ths of the ribbons and each ribbon was 1/6th. \n4.) So then we can calculate the 1/3rd from 5\n5.)

That would be quite a pile of dimes.\nOutput: The question hints at the idea that flat world theory involves a pile of money. As such, the answer to choosing which alternative is false must be A, since 1. A flat world would not be worth any money in the first place if it does not exist, and 2. If a flat world does exist, then this statement does not make sense. In context A, it is a statement regarding a flat world not having any value rather than a statement regarding a flat-earth actually existing.\nB. This alternative suggests a correlation between a flat earth and a certain person's wealth. As such, the flat earth cannot be assumed to be false. This would not be the case if it weren't for the statement about the pile of money. \nC. This alternative implies that a person who says they would have a pile of dime can make the flat world belief. As such, it cannot be assumed to be true. \nD. The statement \"that would be quite a piles of dimes\" contains a mistake in the use of \"piles\" and \"quite.\" \"Piles\" is not normally used to describe the amount of something, it is usually used when used as a verb to describe the act of accumulating something into heaps.

Which options best reflect the answer order? Choices: 1) A: 9 + 8 = 17 B: 8 + 17 = 25 C: 9 + 25 = 34 D: 8 + 34 = 42 E: 9 + 42 = 51\nOutput: 1-9) The first five options all involve solving mathematical equations involving numbers that are already given in the problem. This is not the intended outcome of the question.\n10-12) Solving this question involves a simple process of addition followed by subtraction. The man started with 19 apples, gave 8 to his mother, and then ended up having 11 apples left. The options are then all just simple multiplication problems, such as the 8 B: 8 + (11-8) = 25. E: the end result of 9 multiplied by 42 is 396, which when rounded comes out as 400\nSo the final answer:\n   (1)A: 9 apples + 8 apples = 17", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "1) The amount of time it takes to fill 24 gummy bear packets with the factory's 300 gummi bears is 240/300, which equals 2/3 of an hour or 40 minutes.\n2) The number of packets of gummi bears that the factory can fill at a time is 180 (240/150 == 16/5, which rounds to 18).\n3) The formula for the number of minutes it takes to fill the 240th packet at this rate is the number given, 240, divided by the number of packets it takes to fill one minute, 180. Doing so, you will notice that you get 1.333333, which will be rounded to 1.3 (3 and 6 decimal places past the given problem). This multiplied by 60 (minutes in an hour) and 40 (the time it took to fill 24 packets at the given rate, also calculated earlier in the process) equals 2,299.6\n4) To round this value to the nearest tenth, the fourth and fifth decimal place are discarded. Thus, the total time to fill 244 gummi bear packets equals 2,230 minutes or 37.5 hours.\nSo the final value is 37.5\n\nInput:What is 1/2 of 3/5?

{"text": "1. The first thing to notice is that the answer is going to be in minutes. The question doesn't ask for 6 minutes or 15 minutes, so these are not valid answers.\n2. It is assumed that the total distance they are covered is 6 miles so even after 1 hour, they will be at the same distance.\n3. They will each run at the same rate, since both of them started at the same spot. If it is the case that one run faster than the other, the answer changes.\n4. Bob can cover a total of 6 miles in 6 hours since that is the maximum distance he can travel. So, a 1 hour head start is actually 5 hours of extra running for him.\n5. As a result, 1 hour is equivalent to 5 miles (6 hours (6 miles/1 hour)) in math terms.\n6. So instead of 5miles he has to travel an extra 5/3 miles for him to be able to gain the extra 1 mile headstart, leading to 15 minutes.\n7.

This sentence implies that this builder lacks purpose or has no direction.  This can neither refer to his character nor his motivation, because he didn't see any \"reason to make the effort to... build such a structure\", which isn't necessarily \"lazy\".\n2.) Based on the above knowledge, we need to understand that \"pointless\" and \"lacking purpose\" are used here as synonyms.  This sentence can't imply that making an effort to build is laziness since it has to make a difference between \"building effortlessly, pointlessly\" (laziness) and \"building effortlessly, purposefully\" (excellence).\n3.) Therefore the conclusion is that \"d) useless\" refers to the builder's actions, and \"lacking purpose/purposeless refers to the result of his actions, and thus he lacks direction.\n4.) Therefore, the sentence means that he \"lacks purpose\" in his actions.  Since the builder does not see any reason to try to build...\" pointless\".\nSo the final is he lacked direction\n\nInput: Everyone has a natural birth rank which changes over time.

Thus it can be inferred that the time unit considered in the question, as Johnny's practice time has not been stated, is a day. \n3. Johnny had half as much practice 20 days ago.  So if the time scale is a day and it hasn't been half as long as Johnny has had practice until now, it follows that Johnny has 1/3 more practice now than he did when the time scale was still only half as long.\n4.

This is not the best answer because for this value to be true, we must have n = 4 choose 3 == 1 and j must be a real number.\n3) The next option, B: 2 choose n = 1 choose n - 1:  1 choose n - 2 = 1 < n - 1 >= n and n - 1 choose 1 = 2 because n >= 2.

{"text": "1, Annabelle's choice of words suggests that her actions indicate she has a sense of right and wrong. She collects $30 a week but spends a third of it on nonessential items, in spite of being somewhat conflicted. This would suggest she has a high level of self-consciousness. \n2. From this we can conclude that Annabelle does not have the complete picture of what she spends her money on.\n3. Annabelle's guilt would therefore lead her to save the rest of the money. \n4. We can't conclude this without considering everything she buys. If she spent $21 on sweets, $2 on chips and $6 on chocolate bars, then we can't tell the difference between $8 and $8 - $2 - $6. This is where we apply mathematical logic.\n5. When $8 + $6 > 30, we know that $8 can't be saved, but $8 - $2 can be saved.\n6. The most intuitive answer would be that  $5.00 or $1.67 is saved. This is because  $1.67 can actually be saved - you don't need to keep $2 to do this. But $5.00 indicates that it's unlikely to have been spent all on nonessential items.\n7.

Since Parker threw the ball for 16 yards and Kyle threw the  ball 2 times farther that Grant, we can make some subtractions here: (25% - 16) = 9(distance Parker throws-distance Grant throws)\n3. Now for the next part of the question: If Parker out-performed Grant, Grant threw 25% farther that Parker: (25%-16) = (16-25%).\n4.

This implies that the initial number of pink hardhats in the truck was double the initial number of green hard hats. \n5.) Thus, in the truck there were initially 54 green hard hats.\n6.) From this, 15 green hats minus 4 pink hats = 17 green hats remained and 2 times 17 green h = 34 hard hats\n7.) In addition, after the action, there were a total of 59 hardhats. Therefore, the formula: (59 - 4) + (17 - 4) = 34.\nSo the final answe is 45\n\nInput:A plane flies overhead towards the northwest, then at the end of the night, turns around in the sky towards the southeast at a speed of 123mi/hr.  A car drives westward at 80mi/hr into the night.  If the train is headed in the northerly direction as well, how long after the plane will the train pass the car?\nOutput: 1) The question is asking how long after the plane passes over the car the train will pass over the car.\n2) The train does not have to be headed in the norhterly direction.  It only needs to be moving away from the plane that is headed in that direction.\n3) We are not given the train's speed nor its direction.  Therefore, all possible values for its speed and directions should be considered.\n4) Because the speed of the train and the plane are relative to the car, the time the plane passes over the  car must be expressed in the time the car takes to travel one mile.\n5) The time can be calculated using the following formula:\nT = Distance / Speed\n6)", "answer": " 43"}

{"text": "1. This questions is saying Kendall and Keely ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa and that Alyssa each ate some number of nuggets less than the total amount of 100.\n2. The simplest way to solve this problem is to get the three numbers and multiply them by their sum.\n3. Since each girl ate the same amount of chicken nuggets, 40, you multiply that by 3.\n4. Therefore, Alyssa ate 40.\n5. As with a single term multiplication problem, if you multiply two numbers together 2 times, the answer will be twice as large.\n\nInput: 1.  The question is trying to get a value for the variable x with the initial condition x(-1) = x(0) = x(2) = 0.\n2.  In order to apply the given conditions we can use the sum rule of a polynomial with the property if a polynomial is a sum of two polynomials, then the sum of their roots is a root of the polynomial and the product of their roots is also a root.\n3.  Using the sum rule, we can use the value x(-1) which is equal to x(n) on all terms and solve for x.\n4.  Since x(n) = 0, x = x,x(-1) = 0, this means x = 0 or -1.\n5.  With the initial condition and the sum rule, we know that x = 0 because x(-1) = 1 and x = 0 and so from this information we can draw a conclusion that the x will be changing at a constant rate over the first interval.\n6.  The problem was made much simpler to solve by making use of the sum rule.\nInput: The most profitable use for bacteria is to make what?

{"text": "1. This particular question could be solved using the standard approach of multiplying total number of identical items (i.e. oranges and boxes) multiplied together. However, there is a different approach.\n2. One approach to solving this particular problem could be to use substitution.\n3. Each box holds 30 nectatines. Because 30 is divisble by 150, we know that each box \"contains\" 5 oranges.\n4. Since each crate holds 150 oranages, if a crate holds 16 boxes, then the number of boxes each crate holds is equivalent to 150/16 or 9; each box holds 1/2 crate of oranges.\n5. The total number of oranges in crates is 5 crates * 9 boxes/crate, or 45 boxes. The same principle also applies to apples, since it's not specified that each box holds apples or oranges.\n6. Once we know the oranges, using multipication, we know that each crate contains 5 boxes, totaling 45 boxes.\n7. We can use this information to deduce how nectarines are allotted.\n8. Each box holds 5/30 apples or 2 boxes of apples. The same principal can be followed by substituting it with nectarine: 2 boxes = 6 nectarines; each box holds 3 nectarines.\n9. There are 5 boxes in the crates, totaling 10 boxes of nectarines. Total number of fruit is 45 crates of oranges + 6 boxes of oranges = 51 boxes of oranges  + 10 boxes of apples or nectarines = 61 boxes total.\n10. Since we know that each empty box holds one orange, we can use this information to compute the empty boxes. \nThere are 61 boxes of fruit; however, since there are 16 boxes without fruit, we can conclude that each crate of 16 has 1/4 oranges and 1/4 boxes without fruit.\nThat is equal to 3/4. \n11.

In other words, we cannot directly use this information to determine d, the distance traveled.\n3) (b) Step [b] tells us that the skipper traveled for 20 hours to halfway to the destination. \n4) (c) Step [c] tells us that the storm blew the Skipper's boat backward.  We know from Steps [a] and [b] that the Skipper travelled for 20 hour at the speed of 30 KM/ hour, implying that he is traveling 600 KM in the direction of (east x north). \n5) Applying the Law of Conservation of Energy to this problem, we know the Skipper must be 20 hours = 300 KM back from his destination. \n6) The 20 hours of travel in the direction of northeast, and the new direction of the wind, which is a west blowing wind, has carried the boat back 200 KM (north x east) according to the Law of Conservation and our assumption that this is one-way trip. \n7) Therefore, the Skipper's distance traveled is 600 K + 200 K = 800 KM.\n8) Since the Skipper's speed was 30 KM per hour, his speed is 600 / 30 = 20 hours, which implies he is now traveling 800 / 20 = 40 hours = 200 K or 200 miles at the speed of 20 miles per hour.\n9) Thus, the skipper's speed is 20 miles per hours, which is approximately 30 Km per hours, making his speed for the original trip the same as his speed for the trip he now finds himself", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "1The question is asking about the price of the small tubs in terms of how much the big tubs cost.\n2. First, observe that the question does not explicitly state the cost of the large tubs, which makes deductive and inductive reasoning unfeasible.\n3. Since all the answer options are in terms of $48 (the total cost of all the tubs) and all the options are fractions, we rule out D: $4 and F: $3.20 as they do not follow this pattern. \n4. Now let's look at the options that are numbers: A, B, and E\n5. Option A 91/12 = 7 1/2, so $7 1/2\n6. Option B 3224/72 =  4 21/24, or $4 2/3\n7. Option E 35/66 = 0 7/13, or $0 7/14\n8.

Looking at the options that are not in numerals, one notices that they all have the same format of having a fraction that is greater than or equal to the question stem: A: >6 = 7 1//2, B: >= 6 = 4 2/3, C: >7 = 7 7/14, D: >=6 = 4, or E: >=7 = 0 7\n10. The options with format A: >6 =...., B: >=6 =...., and C: >7 =.... are obviously incorrect, since they are only multiplications of the number $6, so they are immediately discounted.\n11. The options with format D: >=6 =.... (or B: >=6 =...) are also discounted since they are the same amount to the nearest decimal place\n12.

This implies that Ela collects the same amount of firewood as Kimberley and Houston.\n\n3. From this, we can deduce that Ela collects 10 pounds of firewood, same as that collected by Kimberley. This also means that Houston collects 13 pounds of firewood, one more than Kimberley due to the difference in the amount she collected.\n\n4. Taking this information, we can finally solve the question. We know that Ela collects 3 less pounds of firewood than Kimberley, and Houston collects the rest, 5 more pounds.

{"text": "1.) We are looking for the number of total trash cans in the town, so we're looking for Option A: 28 trash cans.\n2.) For this question, we are using the \"halfway\" rule to determine how many trash cans are in the front of stores. This rule states that if the trash can's position is the middle of the road that runs behind the stores, then the trash can would be 150m from the sidewalk.\n3.) The town has 4 street lamp posts as well, which are evenly spaced apart.\n4.) If the trash can is located halfway between 3 lampposts, it is 150m away from a lamppost (based on the Halfway rule mentioned above). \n5.) With 4 lampposts available, that means each lamppost is only 150m apart (because there are 4 streets/lampposts).\n6.) There are 7 stores (including the one on the corner), and we want to place a trash can within 150m of each store.\n7.) The stores are all located evenly on a street with a 150m distance between every lamppost; therefore, the total number of lampposts between stores is 150/7. \n8.) This means that the total distance between lampposts (and thus, stores) is 21.429m on average.\n9.) We don't want all 28 cans to be equally-spaced; we want some more litter cans on one side of the street than the other. \n10.) So we count how many times the number of trash cans is evenly-distributed (i.e., 32 or 52 or 72, etc.).\n11.) If we do not count the evenly-distributed cans, we are still paying 4*7 or 28 extra cans that we just threw away!\n12.)

{"text": "The question states \"if\", implying that the conditions under which the given information is true should be established independently of the formula.\n1.

The area of a rectangle is represented by the formula \"base \u00d7 height\", where height and width are both variables (the length and width), respectively. \n2. The given information says that the width of the rectangle is four inches, meaning width1 = 4.\n3. We can eliminate Option A, where base \u00d7 height = 30. This option implies that the unit of the formula applied is an area. \n4. By substituting the width of the rectangle (4) for base 1, we get 4 \u00d7 height = 3. Hence, height = 3/1 = 3, as suggested in Option C (3 \u00d7 width1 = 12 = 15), Option B (2 \u00d7 height = 6), and Option E (4 \u00d7 height).\n5. We now know that one of the four variables is \"height\", and that the base of the first option is \"30\". However, we can't really apply the formula because \"height\" isn't a unit, and therefore the equation is meaningless.\n6. After rereading the question, we can conclude that perimeter is 36 inches (side 1 \u00d7 side 2) and the height is 2 inches, and that it is a rectangle of area 70 square inches (2 \u00d7 35 = 70), hence Option D is the answer.\nSo the final answers is D: 70\n\nInput:A circle has a circumference measure 312.5 inches.

Choices: A: close B: inside C: clean D: close clean\nOutput: 1 The ring is a circular area in which the fight takes place. \n2. Since the ring (a given term) is circular, all circular-shaped fights are inside fights.  As such, the question is asking for the answer choice that correctly defines \"inside fights\" using the word \"fight\".  \n3. A fight inside the ring is a circular fight.\n4. The answer choice B: \"inside\" is better than A & C because inside fights are circular fights.\n5. The answer choice D: \"close clean\" could be read to have the connotation of two people doing physical attacks on each other near the ring or a small area that resembles a ring, but that area isn't part of a ring as a whole (it is neither circular or located inside the ring).\nSo the final answer given is B: Inside\n\nInput:How many days have you had math in total, including middle school?\nOutput: 3.

To accommodate the diners, the diner has five different servers. For half of the tables, there is a 20% chance that the server assigned to that table is on the phone and, therefore, incapable of quickly getting orders. If each server serves 1/3 of the diners, with the exception of the server on the phone, which tables will be assigned to the other servers?\nOutput: \n1. If there are 15 tables, each table has a 1/15 probability of being assigned to a particular server. In other words, 1/15 is the probability of being assigned to each server.\n2. However, if the server is busy with another task, 1/3 of these 15 tables have a 20% probability of being assigned to the next server, meaning 3/15 are assigned to every other server apart from the server on the phone.\n3. The three servers serve a total of 15/3 tables.\n4. The total number of tables served by all three of the servers is 15/3 + (15 * (2/3)) = 15/3 * (8/3) = 67/9 tables.\n5. The probability of a table being served by all three servers is 67/9 and 5/9 for any given table.\n6. If a table is assigned to all three servers, then each one of them has a 5/9 chance of receiving the order, which adds up to 15/9 in total.

Since we are told that Nadia walked as far twice as how far that Hannah walked, the first clause tells us that the distance Nadia walked should be equal to two x 18 km = 36 km.\n7. When we already know that Nadia walked 1 8 km, if it was 18 2 kilometres as well, the distance she walked would add up to 36 km.

Since it would be silly to buy a phone to then sell it and buy another, Carrie will also likely want to keep the Galaxy that she just spent $240 on.\n7) $80 + $240 = $320 left over in total to buy the phone, which means that $320 / $480 =.66 (about 66% of the proceeds) and so she has 66 weeks to work before she can take the $240 off her earnings if she wishes.\n8) Given the options below, the best one is the one that provides the lowest number.

Given that each climber is traveling at a different speed, 6 feet/min for Matt and 12 feet/min for Jason, their starting heights (in feet) are 60 for Matt and 160 for Jason.\n3. We should find the time at which they are at the same height.\n4. Since they start at different heights, they will reach the top at different times.\n5. We must make sure that they climb for a number of minutes as shown above until they reach the starting height.\n6. From there, continue to climb at their rate of 40 feet per minute until Jason is 80 feet higher than Matt.\n7. We can now write the equation for height of Jason: h_j=160+40(i)  where i is the number of minutes Jason climbs.\n8. Since Matt is already 60 feet high after 7 minutes, the height of Jason is given by: h_j=80-60=20.\n9.

In other words, salt water is denser than pure water.\n4) Since the density of salt water (which includes the density of all impurities) is greater than pure water, the salt water will evaporate faster than pure water.\n5) Jack now has 2 liters of water, and when 2 liters of 20% salt water evaporate and reach its maximum density of 11.2, it will lose 2.2 grams of salt, because that is the density loss needed to convert 2 liters of salt water at 20% concentration to 2 liters of pure water at 11.2% concentration.\n6) This makes 2.2 grants of salt out of 2 liters of liquid.

How will you divide up the apples so that nobody gets left out?\nOutput: \n1. You need to understand the requirements for this question. The first thing that you should do is number the people from 1 to 5, starting with your neighbor. This is because the problem instructs us to give apples to the people by number, which we are solving according to this order.\n2. Now, starting with your neighbor and continuing on according to order, you need to figure out who does not get an apple. This means that no matter who you pick, two of those people will not get an apple. These two people will be either the teacher or the random person.\n3. The next thing you want to do is figure out how many will each person get. Remember you have a total of four apples to go around to those five people. This means that each person would get and apple, but you already gave the neighbor one, so each person would be left with 3 apples. For example, if you gave an apple to your teacher and random person, you would only have 3 apples to give to your roommate, sibling and your neighbor again. To determine who is left out of the equation, you need to figure what combination of these seven people will result in two of the nine people", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "We are looking for how many pounds the weights felt like they weighed when being lowered. \n1. The question says Tom used 10 weights, each weighing 20% more than the one above it. \n2. If each weight weighs 30 pounds, then the weights weigh more than 30 pounds together, correct?\n3. If the weights felt like they were 20% heaveder, then what does that mean? \n4. It means that whatever the combined weight of the 10 weights were, the \nmachines would make them 20% heavy again. \n5. For example, if 10 weights each weigh 360 pounds, the weights would feel like they weighed 420 pounds together. \n6. In this example, because Tom's weights each weigh 20% more (by 3 pounds) than the weights above them, the \"lowerings,\" Tom is actually lifting 420 pounds.\n7. Let's calculate the pounds in another way: 360(10^1/2)/(50) + 30 = 420\n8. Since each weight in Tom's exercise machine weighs 10% more than the weight above it, 50 is 20% more of 25 (so each weight feels like it weighs 12.5% more than the weight 25 pounds above it; but for the sake of simplicity, let's calculate each weight to be 20% heavder than the weight above it).\n9. So, in this example, the machines make each of our 10 weights feel like they weigh 20 pounds more, which is the equivalent of 12.5 pounds in weight. \n10. Therefore, the weights felt like they each weighed 42 pounds (420/10), meaning that Tom lifted 420 pounds on a 30-pound lift. \nSo the final answer should be 420 pounds\n\nInput: How many numbers are greater than 14 but less than 145?\nOutput: The question asks for the number of integers between 14 and 145 that are > 14 and< 145\n1.", "answer": " 360"}

If the difference between their heights is 34m, what is the height of the smaller building?\nOutput:  The statement's precondition, the height of the smaller of the two buildings must be 65m (70m-34m).\n1. This is a basic problem that involves the application of arithmetic in measuring the height difference between the two buildings.\n2. The result of simple subtraction would be 34m and it is possible to deduce the height of the building from this value.\n3. To determine the specific answer to the question, it is not necessary to perform all calculations.\n4.

The sleeves and crackers are relevant units of measurement so we should use them to answer the question, not the nights.\n2. There have to be 5 crackers per box to make up for the 5 boxes of crack Chad eats, so we know there are 25 crackers in each box.\n3. Whenever you know the measurements of the units in a problem, just find the total by multiplying and adding. For example, a box of crackers is 4 * 25 = 100 crackers.\n4. So now we can find out how many crackers Chad eats in one night by dividing 100 by 5. This gives us 20 crackers.\n5. Now that we know the amount Chad eats in a night, we can use some simple division to determine how many days he will run out of crackers.\n6. For example, with what we know about our problem, we know that 20 crackers would take up 5 boxes of crack crackers.\n7. This means that from night 1 to night 5 that he will only have 20 crackers left.\n8. After night 5, he will have 0 crackers left.

Therefore, to meet the jumps-per-second requirement, Mark needs at least 3 skips per 15.962 seconds.\n3. Alternatively, if Mark had a skip every 16 seconds, then every minute would skip at least 9.48 skips. \n4.  Since there are 60 seconds in each minute, this means for Mark to break the record, he would need to skip at least 583.2 skips per minute, or 64,604 skips per hour. \n5. Thus, Mark needs approximately 25,232 jumps per hour to break the record. \n6.

{"text": "1. The question contains 2 parts: what is the size of the smaller house before expansion, and how much is the smaller one being expanded?\n  2. After adding the smaller and larger spaces, the combined houses' size is still 16,012 squared feet, as shown in the diagram.\n  3. From this we can deduce that no matter how much is added the smaller house should not grow to 16,024 squared feet or more as the total size of the combined spaces should be 16,032 squared feet (16,028 + 14 from expansion of the smaller house).\n  4. Since 16,040-16,018 = 22, the difference between the total area before and after expansion is 22 square feet.\n  5. Therefore, the smaller house is being expanded 22 square feet to reach the total of 16,0m2\nSo the final answer after expansion is 2.\n\nInput:If 10 = y, 20=z, and 50 = a, what number equals 350?\nOutput: The key to solve this puzzle is to keep track of which variable you are using in each of the statements.

But if all these stacks had average values as stated above, the total value of all stacks was still around $120 which is still lower than $121. Hence, this is also not true.\n4. The answer finally is statement #3 which says \"The average values of the different packs are different\". \n\nInput: There are exactly five chairs in the five-person committee. A.

{"text": "1. At first glance, it could appear that this question pertains to solving for specific values of x and y where x > y > 0.  However, a closer look reveals that x > 0, y > 0, y < x (which is untrue in the actual case). On top of that, even if values for x > 0 and y > 0 would be true, the question still does not pertain to them.\n2. More importantly, the given numbers are not integers and therefore do not follow an arithmetic sequence; in other words, the amount of yellow and red candies are not fixed constants.\n3. Given such conditions, a more appropriate way to approach the problem would be to first express the given data as fractions and then determine the number of candies that Carlos ate (ie, x \u00f7 (1 \u00f7 3 x + (1 \u00f7 2  x  + y) )).\n4. Since it is not stated how Carlos ate his candies (ie, at one time or one-by-one) and x represents the original number of red candies while y represents the number of yellow candies he consumed, he can theoretically eat red candies at twice the rate he eats yellow candies.  Therefore, x \u00f7 (y \u00f7 2) is the number of candies he eats as there are twice as many red candies he can eat in comparison with the number of yellow canddies.\n5. On the other hand, if x \u00f7 (y div 2) is greater than 0, the number of yellow candys Carlos eats is given by (x \u00f7 (y div2 ) ) \u00f7 2.  In either case, however, a final answer can be found by simply dividing (x \u00f7 (2 y \u00f7 2 ) - 0) by (-1 x y /2), yielding the answer 21 candies.\nSo the final solution is 21 red candies minus green candies in the end \n\nInput: At the moment, she felt no desire to go there.

{"text": "1,  The question asks for the answer in dollars, not in hours. Thus, the correct answer is $232.50.\n2. To answer this question, you need to first find out the total value of the goods or services provided, in this case, lawn mowing, weed pulling and mulching ($63, $11, $9, respectively), then multiply the number of hours worked by the cost per hour ($44, $59, and $44, respectively) to find the total amount of money earned, which is $1668. Then, all you need to do is subtract the non-revenue-generating actions from the total amount of money, and your final answer is $233.50. \n3. This can be interpreted as a question on the concept of marginal cost, which is defined as the difference in total cost between two units of output. In our case, the question refers to hours of work, not units of lawn mowing or mulching. \n4. Given that, you could apply this concept by calculating the cost of an additional hour of work. \n5. For example, if Grace works another hour on each task, her earnings increases by $11+ $6+ $9 = $26. If she works three more hours on each task, her income increases by $11 x 3= $33. \n6. By continuing this calculation, we can conclude that her earnings increase by $9 x 3= $27 for each extra hour she puts in. \n7. In this case, her hours of work are 63 + 9 + 10 = 82, so her marginal cost would be $27 x 82 = $232. In total, her gross income is $1667.50 minus $232.00, which is $1435.50.", "answer": " 567"}

If three of the remaining teachers attended state university and one attended a state college that is on the other side of the country from the others, how many teachers attended state college?\n     1.\n1. The first sentence tells us that if 6 became teachers, then there would have been at least 11 teachers in the study.\n2. Since there were only 10 college-bound students, this means 3+ became teachers and the other 7 remained in the study.\n3. The second sentence tells us that at least two of the seven students who remained were state college students.\n4. The only way for the second sentence to be true means that\n\n            3 * 4 > 0\n       or 3 < 0\n\n       or 3 = 0\n\n5.

{"text": "1) 1) This can happen because when the person is solving the question, there are two assumptions about the time. We know the first part was done in 25 minutes, then we estimate how many minutes the second part will take to finish it. We get an equality and solve for the variable.\n\n2) At this point, we make the two assumptions again. We assume the person knows how many minutes the second and third parts each take. Then we compare the person's total time (2 hours) and the elapsed time (the answer in the question) and find an equality that can be simplified (3 times the second part and twice the third will equal 2). The person takes the same amount of time to do each part; the second part takes 4 times the the third part because it took twice as much time to complete.\n\n3) This can happen because the question implies that the person knows how much time went into each part. We can find how long it took in the third part by taking 24 and subtracting the time the first part took. Once we subtract 17 from 4, we have a time difference of 45 minutes, as the question asked.\n\nSo the final answer for number of minutes Leo finished the third part of the assignement is 45 minutes\n\nInput: Which of the following is the most likely consequence of global climate change?

Thus, the number of photos in the family photography gallery is:\n\n\\$ 400\\:-\\frac{200}{2}=200\\:+\\:\\frac{6(200)}{2}=540\\: \\times\\: \\frac{2}{3}\\% = 228\\:+\\:\\frac{\\:96}{6} = 324\\:+\\:\\frac32 \\times \\frac 14 = 296.8\\$\n3. Next we use the statement \"she added 120 more [photos] than she took on the first day\" as an expression to state the number of photos in a photography gallery. This could be expressed as (296.8-\\frac{296.8}{120})\n4. Afterward we add the result for the equation to the already calculated result, then we multiply the final expression by \\$\\frac 32\\$to get a final result of:\n\n\\$324.\\:\\frac 32 = 296.\\:\\frac 34 \\approx 300\\:+\\: \\frac 12 \\approx 301.\\$\n5. Adding 120 to the total number of photos gives us the final answer of 421.\nSo the final question is C:421\n\nInput: The average monthly cost to feed a Labrador is about \\$40.

Alice drove on alternate days. If John did twice as many miles as Alice, how far did John travel each day?\nOutput:- In a pair situation when a person travels with another, the total distance travelled between the 2 travellers combined makes up the total distance. For example:- In this example, Alice travelled 1/12 x 1200 or 100 miles per day. John travelled 2/12 x 600 or 120 miles per day. It seems that Alice has travelled far less when compared to John but actually John had travelled more miles. The formula below can be used if the person driving one car gets back the driving distance and the other person travels on foot, for example.

Also, even if it did, it was stated that the books were stacked, a variable that was not covered in the options.\n3) With this in mind and assuming that the books were all exactly the same thickness, the height of the stack of 12 inches would be equal to the height of 10 books, since each book has a height of 1 inch and there are 10 books in the entire stack. This means that the height of the top most book in the stack is 12 inches.\n4) Therefore, each book would have at most its own height to add to a total height of 12 inches. As a result, the number of pages per book would never be more than 10.

He decided to create a game using his favorite number-five, and this is how the game was played.   In the first round, the player took a five-ball and threw all five balls at the basket.  If the player didn't make all five shots and if they missed some of the five shots, then they were out.   The player that won the game was the first to make all five shots in the five-ball game of basketball.  One round did NOT equal a basket so a \"five-ball\" round was one shot at the basket.  What is the probability of a player making at least one basket in a five-ball game?\nOutput:We know that in any round, there are five balls needed to be threw at the basket.  It's not 1 round and 1 basket is considered to be an entire game.  In the game, there are 5 rounds and 1.5 shots per round.  The game would end after 5 ball gets threw in one round.  If a player did not make 1.5 shouts in the initial round, the player will be out.  This means that the chance of the first round player making 1.5 shit is 2/5.  This player would not be able to play again for the next round.  The chances of the second round player making 1 shot is already divided by 4 instead of 5 because there are less than 5 balls to throw before the game is completed.

As we know that distance between towns is given in inches and the distance between towns on the map is given in inches, the distance between towns on a 1:4 scale map is also given in inches.\n4. So, the distance between the towns on a map 1:4 is 12 3/28ths inches.\n5. To find the actual distance between the towns, we need to convert the inches into miles.\n6.

{"text": "1) Let's assume the amount of sugar Chelsea put in the four bags were A, B, C, and D. The half of the sugar (equal to half of 4A), A's share, got stolen. This means that the amount of sugar that were divided into the four bags were actually A,B, C, and the theft (half of 4A), D.\n\n2) Now, we get to calculate B,C, and D. You already know A's value (A - half of A). So, you know that B=6A; C=3B;D=C+half of C. So, D = 3B - half of B - half of C =11B/2-10B/2 =7B/2 and B = A - half of A - 7B/2.\n\n3) Now if you plug in the values you've got from the steps above into the statement: \"Chelsea has 4 bags and the total amount of sugar are: 4A, 6A, 3B, 7B/2\", the result you will get is: 4A+(3B - 7B/4) = 9B/2, so B=9 which means D = 27B/2. So half of 3B/2 =13B/2\n\n\n4) To get to the answer, multiply D * 13 and you will find A,C, and E which have the following values A=27, C=34, and E=31, thus, B=6*27 = 162, which is the answer.\n\nSo the final answer of question is D x 13 which is 27 x 13 = 351\n\nInput: You are climbing a hill.

How can Farmer Brown account for 60 heads and 60 legs among his emu birds? The sum of those two numbers would have to be >60, in order for Farmer Brown to have enough emus.\n2. One possible solution: Farmer Brown has 30 emus with 2 heads and 1 leg each. The remaining emus that round out to make 60 all have 1 head and 2 legs each.\nFarmer Brown has exactly 30 emus that are either 2-headed or 2-legged. Of the remaining emus, 20 have 1 head and an additional 1 leg (for a total of 2 legs + the one given) and the remaining 10 are 1-headed and 2-legged (for a total of the 2 given legs).\nThese emus all make a total of 10 heads and 10 legs, which make up the remaining 10 emus. Adding the 30 two-headed ones and 10 two-legged ones, there are a total of 40 emus in the flock!\nSince the total of the legs and heads has to equal the total of the emus, and since the sum of the emus and the total of the heads and legs is exactly equal to 60, the only way this could occur is if we have 30 emus in this flock with exactly two heads (and therefore exactly two legs), and the remaining 30 emus are either all two-headed or all two-legged. Since our total for 30 is 40, that means that every other emu also has either two heads or two legs (since 40-30 = 10, which is how many emus would have to be left with one head and two legs, two of which is the same as two heads). There are two ways to be certain that the flock has 30 2-headed and 30 2 legged emu birds, and thus 60 heads and a total of 62 legs, making the total 61:\n30 - One-Headed, Two", "answer": " 20"}

However instead of doing that, we will start by looking for an equation that can make $252:\n\t- Adding 15% to last year's price makes $252.\n\t- Adding 2% to last year' price makes $254.\n\t- Subtracting 15% from last year's price is -$35.835.\n\t- Substituting last year's price -2% in the final answer is $255.93, which is close to the correct answer: $252\n4.

Therefore, the true number of books will fall between 25 and 12 books, and the answer is either A or C.\n5. After determining that our first few answers are not the final answer, we must determine which answer is the most accurate and most comprehensible to the question.\n6. After reading these answers, it's logical to reason that if Stu has 9 books than 25 would be an overstatement for the number of books Stirling owns.\n7. Therefore, A: 9 looks like the most appropriate answer.\nSo the final correct answer is A: 9\n\nInput: The 1995 edition of the Guinness Book of World Records listed an Australian as the shortest human in existence.

The question suggests the need to include an initial digit followed by a unit of measure, and all answers satisfy this criterion.\n2. \"Half\" could be interpreted to also be inclusive of \"half\".\n3. The final digit could also be expressed either using units of measure or simply as a digit.\n4. The statement says that \"A woman's shoe sizes\" is composed of numbers that \"plus\" together are the same as a number that has been \"divided\" by three (of something).\n5. A woman's shirt size is the product of adding the two units of measure with a number representing a size, and dividing the result by three.\n6. Thus, the correct interpretation and answer choice are \"plus\" and \"divide\" with option D.\n\nInput: If the length of a 7-digit number is doubled, what happens to its 2 last digits?

In the example, the cost of the children's items is found by calculating and summing the individual costs according to the type of item. The shopping center's price $8, $18, and $80 is then subtracted from the total costs to arrive at the total cost of the items. Sales tax is then applied, with $0.40 added for each T-shirt, $0.40 for each sweater, and $0.50 for each jacket. Since Kevin needs to buy six T-Shirts, four sweater and five jacks, and the total cost of the children' total items is \\$$82.70\\$.\n3. To find this, we would calculate the total cost of each item in the childrens' clothing. The total cost of the six T-shirits is \\$8\\$$8*.40 = \\$3.20\\$. The total cost of the four sweaters is \\$18.00 \\$. The total cost of each jacket is \\$80. We add together the four sweaters and six T-shirtts, and multiply that number by five.

The question specifically states that he must cover the cost of the shoes using his own funds, money from jobs or tasks, and money from his friends or family, implying that these groups of money cannot be combined to cover the cost of the sneakers.\n3. Thus, his income must be less than the cost of the shopping.\n4. The question goes on to give Joey\u2019s options regarding the prices and types of activities he will pursue to acquire the funds, implying that the choices of activities must be enough to cover the cost of his sneakers.\n5.

Each person would carry 10 of the baskets to the house, giving the other 10 to their sister. Then they will do the same, and so on.

{"text": "1a. A little clarification: The initial period is when the child is raised until they are 8, while the \"years after 8\" simply refers to the subsequent eight years after 8.  In the initial period we are given that child rearing costs $10k dollars per year.\n1b. The \"years after 18\" part of the problem is more ambiguous, but it's clear that it refers to the time after 18, regardless of tuition cost.   Tuition, however, is a separate entity entirely from rearing.\n2. The 18th birthday represents the start of the college years (in the United States and, if I'm not mistaken, all over the world today), when the education costs become an important component of child rearing.  Therefore, our first assumption is that the child rearing cost will be divided into two parts: before the 18th birth and after the 18th.\n3. Since the \"years after eight\" are ambiguous, and not explicitly included as a factor in the overall cost, we may take them as irrelevant.  That leaves us with the following:\n  1.

Therefore, the figures on each day can be expressed as 30 boxes each day. \n3. Taking into consideration that the sum of Tanika's entire sales is given by `T =(60 + (50*100) % of 60) `, `T = 60+60*095/100 = 60*99 = 5940`, which when put in percentage becomes `(5940/60) % = 99% + 30/60 = 99.50%`, and adding one more day's to the total yields 16,420 boxes.\n4.

The question asks for the cost difference between the two items.\n2. Cost is equal to the difference between the original total money and the total expense.\n3. Let's assume that the original total equals 12 initially, and J and J2 is the cost of two products originally. Then:\n(J2 - J) = J2 - 0.5 x J2\n\n4. The question states that\n\n\\$\\$$J + J2 = 1.7 x J + J2\n\n5. Therefore,\n\n\\$\\$$1 + $J + $J2 = $1.7 + $2J + $2J2\n\n6. Solving for J, J = 15", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "1, The question is asking for how much money Hilary had given in total (not inclusive taxes). The tax would not count towards the total amount, so it would not be necessary to add it in.\n2, The tax, in terms of the question, is a percentage of the total amount. Because tax is an amount added, the amount should not be included when calculating the amount.\n3, There are also two different prices in the question, the samosas and the pakoras (the price includes tax). For the most straightforward calculation, both prices should be used to find out the total amount.\nThe formula is: (2x3 + 3x3 + T + R)^m = T\nThe m refers to the amount of taxes payable. However, Hilary's meal only had one menu item, which was samosas. In addition, the question specified a total amount of $20, and not a total amount of $30.\nIt was stated that Hilary had three samosas at $ 2 each. She also bought four orders of pakoris, at $3 each. She left a 37% tip.\nThis implies that the meal's total cost would depend almost entirely on the cost of the samosa, and a large portion of that cost would be determined by the total number of samosas bought.\nAfter some rearrangements, it was seen that the total price was 234, given that 2x3 x 4 = 234, as can be seen by the following equation:\n(0.23 x 2679) 234) = (0.37)(20)\nIf the price of the samosas was $2, which meant that each samsa was 2.28069162267199 dollars.\nThe total cost after adding taxes will be 278.

If the flip came up with \"tails,\" this means \"tails\" is the first element in the list. Add 1 to the total and assign the value \"1\" as the first part of the second element in the list.\n4) If the flip came back \"heads,\" add the number of \"heads\" to the total. If it came back \"tails,\" it is the first character in the second element, so add 1 to the \"heads\" total and assign a \"t\" to the beginning of the second element. If it came back the same, this means that heads came up again. Keep adding to the \"heads,\" and keep starting the second element again.\n5) If we continue this, we know that heads came up 65 times.

The original question mentions that on average every 6 of their cows produce 148 liters of milk; each cow, on average, produces 54 liters of milk per 6 cows.\n3. [Assuming the five weeks are equal, there are 52 liters of milk per cow per week. The 52-liters-per-cow-per-week time period results in 52/5 = 10.4 liters of milk produced per week/per cow.

We can further dissect this by considering how much money Clark saves if the discount per part is $36.\n3. Since the price is $80 per part and the discount per part equals $36, the total cost divided by the discount amount equals the number of parts. Since the whole cost is $439 and the discount was $ 36, that means we got 12 discounted parts for that amount.\n4.

Choices:  Ank, Cat, Chat, Hydat, Krat, Muckat, Rattat, Ratcat, Squat, Tack, Tatt, Tattat, Tocat, Tuckat, Xatt, Xaxa, Yack, Zach, Zachat\nOutput: The answer is 'C: Zaxat'.\n\n### Instruction:This function receives a string value as input, and a dictionary (with 'a' and 'b' as the keys) as input. Given that a string can only be mapped to a single dictionary key, how should the program then decide which one gets mapped to it?\n\n**Input Format**: The input consists of the string $S$, and of the dictionary $D$.\n\n**Constraints**:\n\n* NIL denotes the lack of a key.\n* If $string \\mapsto k \\in D$, then value of $k$ is $None$.\n* The following conditions are always satisfied:\n        \n* The key does not occur in $D$.\n* The key is guaranteed to be unique for $D$.\n\n### Instructions:We use three strings 'A', 'B' and 'C'  as our data type, such that \n\n\"A\" :\n(\n \"A\" is an empty string or blank string,\n\"A\" represents  \"No value assigned\" or  \"Not applicable\",\n\"A\" represents an empty list,\n\n\"B\" :\n(\n  \"B\" means \"Boolean\",\n  \"B\"", "answer": " 116"}
{"text": "1) The question states that kangaroo is 5 times greater than koala.\n2) We can find the ratio of kangaroo to koalas directly from the statement: there are 180 k (kangaroos) and 36 k (koalas), so 180:36 = 5:1\n3) To find the answer, simply multiple 180 and 5, and we can say the answer is 7:3 which can be written as 7K:3K in ratio form.\n4) So answer is 7 koalas and 10 kangaroos.", "answer": " 216"}
{"text": "1.) There is not a specific format for this question. 2.) Justin\u2019s box height, length, and width are known, thus the volume is the combination of these three dimensions (which is the only information provided in the question). The box\u2019s volume can be calculated using V = lwh or by utilising the height multiplier h, length multiplier l, and width multiplier w. 3.) From the information given, l = 3h and w = 4h; thus lwh = 2h3. 4.) If the formula for the volume of a rectangular prism is used (V = bh l), where b = the volume, h = 12 inches, and l = 2h3, then the volume is 576 cubic inches.\n\nInput: If you spend 55% of your time in high school studying for tests, how many hours a day would you study to have the same amount of time spent on homework?\n\nOutput: 1: There is not an obvious structure of the question. 2: I assume that \"h\" represents the total time for \"how many hours a day\"; 3: (I): If the question means \"If you spend 55 percent of your time in highschool studying for the test, how much time a day do you need to spend studying for your test?\", then you need to have 20 hours a day. Thus the answer is Option C: I spend 3 hours a day studying for a test. \n\n#### Tips:\n- If the question does not have any obvious structure, try to look for an answer from a similar question.\n- Try to apply the concept to get a closer answer.", "answer": " 3,888"}
{"text": "1) The question mentions 20 bananas and 3 cups of mush. This implies that the ingredients are being used in the same recipe or are related to each other in relation to the cups of mush being used. \n2. The ingredients are described as 3 cups of banana mush and 4 bananas. \n3. It is said that for every one cup of banana mash, you need 3 cups of all-purpose flour. \n4. So, based on these factors, one has to solve for the flour.\n5. Hannah needs 20 bananas for one cup of mush, and for every cup of mush, she needs 3 cups of 4 bananas.\n6. So she needs 27 cups of bananas for every cup of mash.\n7. So her 20 bananas are divided equally between two recipes, each with 4 cups of banana. \nHence 27-2 = 25 cups of flour needed\nSo the final answer for this question is 25\n  \n### Challenge 4:\n### Instruction:Answer the question to this challenge question\n\nInput: This sentence is not in the question.

{"text": "1.James ordered more drinks for himself than for his friends. He ordered 6 for himself but only 2 each for each of them.  This, combined with the fact that James spent more than his friends, implies that he will be spending more than them.\n\n2.We are asked about the amount that James spent. Therefore, what is relevant in this case is the amount he spent at the bar.\n3.To find out how much he spent: first, find the total amount James spent at the bar in addition to what he spent on the food, assuming James ate the fried chicken when at the bar:\n- The amount for each round of drinks plus the amount for each drink.\n- The total amount for his fried chicken\nTotal amount James spent -> (2 rounds of drinks * ($6 + 20)) + (5 friends * $6)) + (6 + 6 * $14)\n\n4. The amount of his bill: (6 drinks + fried chicken)* 30% (his bill amount)\n\n5. Total $243\nSo the final answer should be $243", "answer": " 163"}

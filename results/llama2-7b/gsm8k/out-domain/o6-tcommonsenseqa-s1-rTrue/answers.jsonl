Choices:A: Lizards B: Ants C: Bees D: Beetles E: Spiders\nRationales:1. Mark should plant flowers or other colorful plants every year in his garden to attract pests (ants, wasps, bees, beetles, etc.) which eat damaging insects like lizards that feed on plant leaves.  2.  It would be a wise decision to grow flowers which attract spiders (e.g. Black-eyed Susan:Thunbergia, or Rice flower: Oryzaephorus) which eat pest insects. If there aren't many spiders or they're slow to arrive at the plant's nectar due to rainy season, it will take more than one species of spider (e.g. the Common Spider: Ariadne, the Funnel Web Spider: Aganippe, the Cave Spider: Pholcus.) to control the garden.3. Aphids and leafhoppers, etc. harm plants. The spiders will have more competition fighting off these garden pests. For the best pest control, Mark will need to plant lots of flowers. 4. It is the ants that help to kill these garden pests and plant pesticides. However, the ants also carry plant diseases to the garden and then feed and share them with every plant.5. There are no flowers available that will attract ants but they do help to control pest insects. Bees are the best pest control since they are a non-pest insect they are beneficial to the plants. They are important to every plant that produces seeds for reproduction. Without bees, plants become sterile and die with no pollination. 6. Some flowers do attract bees, but a gardener needs to have a few hundred plants in their garden to attract the required bees for pollination. That is why organic agriculture is becoming more important. \n### Demonstation:\n1. Mark has a garden with flowers that he planted. He got four more plants to his garden last year.

{"text": "steering tires, and 8 supporting tires. How many tires fit at the bottom of the truck? Choices: 0  1  2  3  4\nRationales:This is one of the questions that test your ability to solve a problem logically. All answers have to be whole or integer values. \n\nThe key point to remember here is that the solution has to be between the numbers 0 and 8. \n\nLook at the following points as you attempt to answer the problem:\n\n1. The number of tires at the bottom of the vehicle has to be an integer in the range between 0 and 8 - so the answer cannot be 1 or 2.\n\n2. It cannot be 0 tires either, because then the vehicle would not have any tires at the bottom, making it unable to drive anywhere.\n\n3. The number of tire at the bottom cannot be 3, because when you add the number of steering tires (2) to the number of supporting tires (8) you get a total of 10 which exceeds the 8 tires at the bottom limit.\n\n4.The combination of steering tires, supporting tires, and number of tires at bottom cannot be: 0, 1, 6 or 7 because they all are outside the integer range. So those are incorrect answers. \n\nAfter eliminating all the incorrect answers above, think about how else there can be 8 tires at bottom, so that the total is 10. You should notice that the sum of steering and supporting tires, 10, is not divisible by number of tires. If it happens to be, it will work, but is more unlikely, and you can eliminate it based on its higher probability.\n\nThus, the answer has to be 0 tires at the bottom.

Is there a specific period of time each day that someone should spend reading after they take up a position or responsibility? Explain your answer, please.\n\n### Solution:\nRationale 1: Mrs. Snyder used the time she spent reading in her old position to read in her new position. This is because she had to spend less time reading in her new position than she did in her old position. This meant that she still had the time she had spent reading in her old job. There is no logical reason she would spend more of her time reading or less of her time reading. So, the assumption is that she would continue spending about the same amount of time reading as she did in her old job.\n\nRationale 2: The question asks if there is a specific period of time in which to spend time reading after one has taken up a position or responsibility. This suggests that Mrs. Snyder does not spend time reading in addition to her position of teaching. She still has to spend less time reading than she had when she was the librarian. This would indicate that she has to spend time reading in her position.\n\nRationale:\n\nMrs. Snyer must spend time reading because before she was a teacher she was a librarian. She has to spend the same amount of time because when she was a libraran she read at the same time.

A key part of the pizza-making process is the addition of ingredients to the dough, such as tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and various savory toppings.\n3. In order to select the correct multiple-choice option, it is necessary to carefully examine each choice and consider whether it meets the criteria for suitable ingredient additions to pizza dough.\n4. Options \"D: water, E: spaghetti\", \"F: cheese, G: corn\", and \"L: garlic\" are excluded from further inspection because they do not appear to be suitable, either because they are unrelated to pizza or because they are already included as ingredients in the dough or the final pizza.\n5. Option \"C: milk\" is incorrect because the addition of milk to the dough does not fall within the criteria for suitable ingrdients; milk is not used in the typical pizza-making process and does not play a significant role in the finished product.\n6. Option \"B: tomato sauce\" is also incorrect because tomato sauce is already a widely used ingredient in pizza-making; it appears in the dough, either on its own or to act as a base for the addition of fresh or canned toppings.\n7. Option \"A: other ingredients\" is also incorrect because it is too broad to be a suitable choice; the other ingredients that are most commonly added to pizza dough comprise a shorter list of ingredients that already adheres to the criteria in use. \n8.

This implies that we should answer with a time for everyone to arrive at the party.\n\nThen, we note that there are two people, Rachel and Sara. Since the intention of the question is for them to arrive at the same time together, we will need to use the following equation:\n\n(2 * time to arrive) = time to get to the party together\n\nTherefore substituting this into the above equation we arrive at the following:\n\n(4 * time to arrive) - (time to get to the party) = time to get together\n\nWe could say we are looking for the time to get to the event if we include both Rachel and Sara, as well as subtracting the time it would take them to get there separately. \n\nTherefore now the question is:\n\nHow much time it will take for Rachel and Sara to get to the event together subtracted from the total time for them to get to the event individually.\n\nFrom the question we know that we need to find the time when nobody has arrived at the event yet. It would make most logical sense for Rachel and Sora to meet up and leave together (to prevent others from seeing their separate plans to arrive at the event at the same time) \n\nIn essence, Rachel and Sora would want to avoid meeting (arriving) until at least 1/2 of the attendees have arrived at the event.\n\nFrom here we can take a logical guess that the time is 2/3 * 1 / 2 of the event length = 2/3 * length of event.", "answer": " 500"}

{"text": "used her talents to apply makeup for 15+ years.\n \n#### Demonstration: \nIn this task there is a single sentence containing two phrases, \"for 15+ years\" and \"makeup artist\" where if \"to apply makeup\" was changed to \"to study artistry\" the second phrase would not be compatible with the \"and\" joining the two phrases. There is only one phrase that is not compatible with \"and\" which means that only one answer can be correct. Below is the rationales:\n1.The question refers to the work experience of Marcy, which includes 15+ years of being a \"makeup artist\".\n2.This means that the phrase \"to apply makeup for 5+ years\" is redundant in this context.\n3.Option A: The phrase \"for 15 years or more\" refers to the exact same period that has been stated in the earlier sentence. Hence this is unnecessary.\n4.Option B: The phrase \"to study artistry for 5+ years or more\" does not fit with the second phrase in the original sentence \"makeup artist\" as being an artist only refers to an artistic talent rather than a profession.\n5.Option C:The phrase \"to study art and design for 5+ years and more\" is not a grammatically plausible phrase as the \"and\" joining phrase is being used too many times.\n6.Option D: The phrase \"to apply make up for years\" does not fit in the sentence before \"to apply makeup\", the time period given in the earlier sentence.\n7.While option E might potentially imply time beyond 15+ years, this is not specified. We need to select the phrase that can be applied to the time period given in \"for 15+\" years. Hence \"to be a makeup artist\" is the only remaining phrase capable of being applied to a period of 15+ years and is the correct answer. \n8.Hence, answer (E): to be a makeup artist is the only answer that fits.\nAnswer: E \n\n### Input : The boy's brother thought he knew everything that could be done, that included the fact that he knew everything regarding to what?

The canisters can either be gas canisters or gas station canisters in a vehicle.\n3. Straws can be used in conjunction with gas canisters to refill them.\n4. An alternative to refilling a tank of gas or a gasoline canister is using suction or vacuum power to extract the gas.\n5. Straws have been found to use suction power to open certain types of gas canisters.\n6. Therefore, the best choice is option B: using a straw to remove the valve on a gas canister or to get into a gas station canister.

{"text": "8 cm per week, what is she's weight in kilos?  Choices: A: 23 B: 92 C: 259 D: 160 E: 446\nRationales:\n*1. The question is about finding the weight in kilos of a person named Haley, who grows at the rate of eight centimeters per week.\n*2. We can infer that Haley is of a reasonable height (as she is growing), so we will assume that she is about 180 cm tall or at least at least 170 cm tall.\n*3. From her height, we can solve for the weight in kilos that is 80 kg using the formula: weight = 0.98 * height ** 2.\n*4. The available options, A, B, C, E provide different ranges in weight (23, 92, 259, 160, 446), but no options are within the range of weight calculated by applying the formula (200+80/1.82)**2, which is between 188-208 kg.\n*5. We will consider those options only, which provide a weight that is within the range of 180-220 kg. \n*6. A) 23 is not in range, B) 92 is not in range, C) 259 is not in range. \n*7.

The answer choices are: a dairy allergy, lactose intollerance, a peanut allergy, an allergy to eggs, and a gluten allergy.\n3. From the above, we can see that people may develop allergies to specific ingredients found in ice creams like the ones sold at Dan's shop.\n4. For instance, an allergy to gluten is a reaction to a specific protein found in wheat, ruling out E: allergy to eggs. However, this doesn't specify what type of ice cream is being sold in Dan's shop. There can be dairy-rich flavors and eggs and peanut or non-gluten containing ingredients in it.\n5. On another hand, D: peanuts allergy does not relate since peanuts are not typically used in the ingredients used. There is also an allergy to dairy and E: eggs, but both of which are common ones and not exclusive to ice cream.\n\n### Rationale: 6. Option A:  A dairy allergy is the most common food allergy of all. It is not specific to foods that contain milk.

The question is asking where Larry is located in the park when this is happening: \"In the park, Larry is sometimes at a bench and sometimes he sees them.\"\n3. The choices are all possible locations to be in the park.\n4. However, we want to find the answer where he is likely to see them.\n5. Therefore all other options can be ruled out except A: bench and E: fence.\n6. Bench and fence both prevent you from seeing things clearly at a distance, so it is highly unlikely that Larry saw somebody on the bench or someone's dog from the fence. The odds are the same for the other directions too. \n7. Out of the two, bench would be less likely than fence. They seem to be both \"fences\" (in a different way) as you sit on a bench and look at something from there, and you sit on a fence and look at something that is across you.\n8.

The time is what you have worked for, not the card itself so Fill in the time card can't be right.\n3. Fill in the time isn't a thing so that can't be right either.\n4. Our time isn't on the table, in our hands so that can't either.\n5. The printer can't be right because you can't fill anything out on there, you can only print. \n6.

The desk can't be right since your cards don't go there, they get put on your desk to show your boss how much you've worked.\n8.

The question is looking for the answer to the sentence \"is the young girl going to make cookies?\", given that she has poured blueberry muffins (not cookies) into a pan (not a cookie sheet). \n2. Now considering the answer choices: \"A: Yes\" means that the girl is indeed going to be making cookies with those muffins. The muffins she poured into the pan are obviously meant to be turned into something else, and there's no reason to use blueberry muffins unless they're for baking.\n3. \n\"B: No\" is not a correct answer either as if the purpose of muffins were for cooking they wouldn't be called muffins.\n4. \"C: Yes, but\" is a common phrasing used to say that although a person does indeed have all the traits to say they fit into a category, in this case if the young girl is making cookies, then she would have to be using a cookie sheet as opposed to a pan. However, since a blueberry muffin and cookie are completely different things, just because she's pouring a blueberry muffins instead of a cookie doesn't mean she's not going to be making cookies.\n5. \"D: No, but\" is a phrase often used to say that although one doesn't have the full traits for a category, they do fit enough traits that they can qualify to be in that category. In this case however, \"No, but\" would have to make sense because it's saying that although she is not using a cookie sheet, (i.e. the traits to say she's going to make cookies) but she's still making cookies.

{"text": "and a cat, which each can get to food from the same opening. The food is only accessible to the animal when the opening is blocked off. They get food from where? Choices: A. a bucket filled with water B. a large box C. a small box D. a food bowl E. a tree\n\n### Demostration\n\n\n1. Let's consider the statements in the question carefully. Firstly, if the large opening in the small box or the bucket were blocked off, then the two pets would not be able to reach food even if they're both in the same location. \n2. Hence, the food is most likely not in or near these two locations. \n3. Then, there is the small box which may contain food. \n4. The cat in this scenario only reaches the food when the opening is blocked. Consider the food's location. \n5. In this context, the cat would seek out food after the opening became blocked. \n6. Consider the hare. It may be in the same area as the cat. The hare typically eats only when threatened. It doesn't get food after the opening is blocked.\n\n1. Thus, the food is most likey in an area where the large opening is blocked. We can dismiss answer choice B\n2. Now we've ruled out answer choice B and the large opening is blocked, the food isn't in a bucket as neither the cat nor the hare will eat food out of a bucket.\n\n3. The food isn't in option d, unless the food bowl has a tiny opening from which the food is served from and the large opening is blocking everything else. (Unlikely)\n\n4. The food is definitely not in the tree as the cat prefers to eat when the large opening is blocked so the large opening would need to be accessible to the cat. The hale would need to eat in this case as well. Otherwise the food would be accessible to both pets. \n\n5. Neither of these is the case so option E is definitely not the answer.\n6. That leaves us with only option C - a large box with a large opening that is blocked.  \n7.

{"text": "tall, how about a person who was 100x taller?\n### Rationales:\n1. If I was as tall as a 100-meter tall tree, I would be incredibly tall. If I was 100 times as tall as a 4 meter tall person, I too would be quite tall.\n2. We can see that there are three main parts of the question: first, the tree's height (100 meters). Second, the person's height (1). Third, the person's multiplied by a factor of 100 (x).\n3. Notice that 100x is the same as 100 x 1 or 100 x a factor of 1. Since we are multiplying a number and an identical quantity, then the number stays the same after the multiplication.\n4. So let's assume that the person being compared to the tree is a person of average height. The height of a person is commonly defined as how tall the person stands without shoes. People of average height tend to weigh 154.3 lbs on average, which is about 70 kg. It is common for people to weigh between 68.4 kg and 123.4 kg.\n5. If a person weighs 68.40 kg, then they are at the lowest end of the average mass range of people. We will denote this number as 0.7000 kg. If a person weighed 123.20 kg, then they would be at the upper end of the average mass average. We call this number 1.2320 kg.\n6. So, if a person had a mass of 70 kg, then 100x70 would equal 700 kg. Since 100x anything is the same as 00, then the 00 becomes the same as 700. So, 100x a person equals 700 kg or 1,543 lbs. The person would be so tall that they would be more than three times the height of the world's building, the Burj Khalifa. So basically, they would be so tall that the person could probably see the planets orbiting around the sun.\n7. So,", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "ing so what is being fished while fishing? Choices: A: the fisherman B: the fisherman's rod C: the bait D: the bobber E: other than the angler\nRationales: In this question, we are asked to identify the object  that is being \"fished\" while fisherman \"Caleb\" is on the hunt for fish.\n\nTo answer this question, it is important to consider what \"fishing\" actually involves. In simple terms, fishing is an activity where a person fishes for fish by using a fishing rod and a bait.\n\nSo the fisherman is using a rod and a bait as he waits for the fish. The bobber will be a float attached to the line, acting as a marker to indicate the presence of a fish.\n\nFrom the choices given, the only thing that is not the angler is the bait, since the bait is only used to attract fish. The rod, bobber, and fisherman are the only ones that are being fished. So, answer D: fisherman's rod is the best choice.\n\nAnswer: D: fisher's rod\n\n### Input:\"Let's play hide-and-seek\" to one's sibling.

We're told that there are 2 more males than females. We can use these clues to determine the total number of both males and females. We know the total number of males is 16+2 which is 18. We also know the number of females must be greater than 18, because men outnumber women and we want a sum.\n\nSo, the female number, x, must be greater than or equal to 18. We can then multiply our known number, x by any number and use a mathematical equation on our unknown variable to solve for it. Therefore, we have this equation:\n\nf(x) =  x * 1 +2 - x - 18 > 0\n\nWhere f(x) is the function.\n\nNext, we can solve for x:\n\nx > 18\n\nTherefore, the answer is 14 Females.\n\nSolution: 14\n\n\n### Input.When traveling over a long period of time, how is the body affected?

Since she would have been two times as old, that is, 164 divided by 2 = 82, she would have been eight times as old 82 /82 /82 as she was at 12. \n\nThis clearly doesn't answer the riddle, since the riddle asks 'how many times as old as she would be when she was 12', but the calculation for her age now divides by 8 and not 8.\n\n**ONE AND A HALF TIMES - OLDER**. \n\nThe question asks when she is 2 times older than she was at 13, so from the equation above, if we plug in 14 to 15, we get\n\nTherefore, her age now will be (96) = 28.\n\nHowever, she was 8 times older when she was 14, so now at 28 years old, she will be 2 times as old as she is at 14", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "friend of hers. Which of these animals costs the most to care for? Choices: \nA: rabbit B: horse C: pig D: dog E: cat\nRationales1. The question asks which of five animals costs the most to feed and care for.\n2. All of the options are animals that can be bought and given as gifts.\n3. We can rule out rabbits and cats because they are both small domesticated animals well suited to indoor living.\n4. The pig is much more suited to living outdoors and has a distinct habit of eating all types of food, including that which is not fit for consumption.\n5. These factors make pigs more expensive to feed than the other animals.\n6. The horse is a herbivore and is prone to getting sick if its diet becomes too varied, but it is still less expensive to feed it than pigs.\n7. Rabbits eat seeds, which do not cost much at all.\n8. The four remaining animals eat plant-based food.\n9. While the sheep costs the most to feed out of the four remaining animals, it is still less expensive than the pig.\n10.

Raising money requires using one's abilities to work or produce something valuable, such as through a job or business venture. This isn't possible since the individual is busy and doesn't have time for an additional job or venture.\n3. Having funds refers to a particular amount of money that one already possesses.\n4.

Choices:A: $46.68 more per weekB: $46.50 more per weekC: $46.21 more per weekD: $46.35E: $46.40\nRationales:This question asks how much more money Mike is making each week from his job.\n5 months ago Mike was earning $46.53. So today Mike is earning $40.46 more than he was earning 5 months ago.\n\nChoices for this question: A-$46.68, $41.46B-$46.50, $40.43B-$46.21,$40.65D-$46.35, $40.32E-$46, $40.50Correct answer:\n\nC : $46.22  \nIt is 46.50-40.50 = 6.00.\n\nWe can use these 6 dollars to start of our percent. \nIn our initial 6 dollar, we have to find what percentage of our 6 dollars is represented by our percentage.\nIn this, we can use addition and subtraction. If we add $46.59-15% = $42.25 which is not a full dollar.\n\nTo find out if it is not whole dollars, we can use division. 15/100 =.15. \n.15 divided by.98 =.155454 which is a whole dollar.\n\nIn the next line, what we did was subtract the remaining amount of the original amount of the percentage. 15%-(46.59 - $46.25) = -$2.54\nSince the original percentage was 15%, the remainder was to be deducted from the original amount to find out that if the initial amount was reduced from 6 dollars to 4 dollars.\n6-4= 2 \u00f7 100%-3%=.0075\n\n\n\n\nSo our result for 5 months ago and now was -.0", "answer": " 15400"}

When it follows \"make\", it should be an object.\n2. The following options consist of the things that you can make with milk, sugar, and chocolate: chocolate, cakes, candies, and chocolate fondue. This includes the things that Kantana likes.\n3. Thus, the correct answer is A: milk.\n\n### Input:[A boy plays baseball. The game happens twice a week on a regular day. The game is when he is available. The game happens when he has time. He misses when his homework is not done.] Choices: A: Friday B: Monday C: Wednesday D: Tuesday E: Thursday\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. When the conditions are not satisfied, he misses the game. We need to choose the options which satisfy all the conditions.\n2. Choice B: Monday, he plays baseball on Mondays so it satisfies the first condition, but Mondays are weekly, so it misses the homework condition. \n3. Choice D: Tuesday satisfy the homework condition, but not the weekly condition.\n4. Choices A, C, and E do not make sense as baseball is played twice a week on a fixed and regular day.\n5. According to the rationale, the correct answer is Monday.\n\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. The phrases \"when he misses the game\" and \"when his homework is not don\" appear to describe two distinct scenarios that could happen.\n2. Let's focus on the phrase \"when he misses.\" It is clear that this refers to when the game is not played due to a reason like homework.\n3. Let us consider that the weekly condition is satisfied. The game is played on Fridays, and Tuesday is not Saturday. Therefore, the game can be played.\n4. Given that the game can be played, it can't be a time when homework is not done, so this excludes C and D as the only options that satisfy the weekly condition and homework condition are A and", "answer": " 22"}

B: 3 is incorrect again as the statement gives us exact information for all of the arrivals.\n4. C: 4 is incorrect as the statement gives us that info but doesn't specify how many people were present.\n5.

{"text": "off the fallen leaves\nRationales:1. The phrase \"and cleared off the fallen leaves\" is a description of the action taken by someone and could refer to various things like vacuuming, scrubbing, etc.\n2. Choice D: \"vacuuming\" is an unlikely answer as this does not involve removing the leaves, although this answer is possible if the leaves have already been vacuumed and additional leaves have fallen since then.\n3. Choice B: sweeping is a possible answer but might not be the best choice as sweep typically implies a broom and this is not stated specifically.\n4. The other answers, writing names, cleaning windows and painting are not actions that \"cleared off the fallen leaves\".\n5. In summary, based on the given information, the best choice is A: \"scrubbing\". The phrase \"and cleared\" implies an action that removes the leaves from the porch, specifically. Scrubbing would be a likely candidate for doing this without vacuuming.\nAnswer: A; scrubbing.\n\n### Input; The man walked through the town square where he was met by the protesters.\nRationales:\n 1. The question refers to a specific location where the man walks through.\n 2. Protests are a form of organized demonstrations that typically happen in public settings such as town squares.\n 3. There are six possible choices, and we need to select a location where protests can plausibly occur.\n4 Option C: the park sounds like a viable location, but the question says it is a sqaure. Hence, it can be ruled out.\n 5 Option B: church sounds like a possible answer, but this would involve the man going inside the church itself, rather than walking through it. \n 6 Option A: the man's home describes his residence, so it wouldn't make logical sense for him to meet protesters here.\n 7 Choice D: school is a logical answer, but schools are typically not protest sites as they are places of educational learning, rather than for demonstrations.\n8.

{"text": "her aquarium. After a certain number of days, how many goldfish will Catriona have? Choices: A: Eight B: Seven C: Six D: 1 E: Zero\nRationales:1. The question is about the consequences of Catriona's action (\"How many goldfish will she have after a certain number of days\"). \n2. Catriona's aquarium already contains 8 goldfish; when she feeds them, the total number of goldfish she has increases. We can use the answer choices to determine how many new goldfish she gets. \n3. After feeding them, the total number must have increased by a factor of 1,2, or 3. When this happens, the aquarium will have exactly 1,2,3,4,5,6,7, or 8 more goldfish, respectively.\n4. Option A's answer of \"Eight\" is incorrect because it does not reflect any change after feeding. Option D's answer of \"Zero\", however, is the correct answer.\n5. After feeding, the total number of fish must be 9 at most. Hence, this implies at most one fish will be new, meaning that only 8 more fish can be old. Therefore, option D is the best answer, as one fish must be new after feeding. Answer: D: 1 fish\n\n### Instructor Instruction:\nThis is your first instructor challenge.

B: plants, monika wanted to look at more abstract things which we know from other information she wanted to look at plants. C: Leaves, leaves are not abstract. we know this because the question asks what Monika went out for, and if she wanted to look at leaves then she should have stayed within the house and would have found leaves anywhere she went. This answer is incorrect. D: Trees, This answer is incorrect because although looking at trees is related to looking at the woods, there is no specific purpose of looking at a tree.

So the man is 2/3 of what the dog ran because 1/3 is not the same as 2/3 or 3/6. They both ran 1/2 mile but the dog ran the first half.

The answer to this problem can best be found by determining how much Matt worked on each of the days, and then multiplying that number by three in order to find his total.\n2. For Monday, we know he worked for 45/60 = 0.75 of an hour or 45 minutes.\n3. For Tuesday, he worked for 0.75 + 0.75* 1 = 1.5 hours.\n4. For Wednesday, we know he worked 0.75+ 1.5= 2.25 hours.\n5.

{"text": "all went to a concert.What was the name of the lead singer? Choices: C: Mandy, D: Bobby, E: Mike, F: Joe, G: Dave\n#### Rationales: 1, \"Kimberley,...., and Houston...\" makes it likely that the names Kimberley and Houston are female names. 2. \"The concert...\" is also likely in a major setting. 3. The question is asking the audience of an event what the performer's name is, so an audience member could have been asked about it. These clues suggest Kimberley saw Mandy, Ela saw Dave, and Houston saw Bobby. 4. This suggests Option A: Mandy is correct. 5. Option D: Mike: Kimberley might have seen someone named Mike; Ela said there was someone named Mike at the concert, but then Ela heard this name in two people's answers. The audience may have answered with their own name, so Ela might have heard a male audience member talking about him in a male form. 6. Option E: Mike: similar to Mike. Kimberley might have mistakenly written her name down; this answer would have been the best for the person named Kimberley since the person did not have an answer. 7. Option F: Joe: Ela went to the bathroom, and her seat was taken by Ella, who was sitting in place of Ela. Ella and Ela might have both been asked what the performer was, and Ella or Ela did not know the performer's title, because it was not in the title, and Ela said that there are a boy and a girl named Mike in a concert. This person went to the bathroom because it was a good question for Ela, so Ela could leave Ela's seat while Ela was out of the room (and not Ella or Ela). If Ela was at Ela's seat, Ella (and Ela) would have thought Ela knew the answer Ela gave Ela. This choice is also possible to be Kimberley's response and Ela's response, but this does not happen for Ela's answer. 8. Option G: Dave: Kimberley might be Ela or Houston, the latter of which probably did not go to this concert, since she or he did not know, either because the performer had a stage name, or because he or she did not know what the performer'd", "answer": " 13"}

Since Frank is meeting a quota that's new for him or his company, he needs a new sales strategy.\n2.

Out of the given options, all of them could be places where Martin could take place within the house. But only two of them match the context of the question: the kitchen and the patio. \n3. Both kitchen and patio match the context of the party, as they can be used for hosting outdoor gatherings or barbecues.\n4. The patio is an outside space, which fits the party context.\n5. The kitchen refers to an indoor space, which also matches the party context. \n6. We can select one of these two options since both are appropriate in the context of the question.\n7. Hence, the answer to the question is A: kitchen, the patio, and the patio.\n\nInput: He found his way to the door after using what instrument? Choices: A, B, C: Clock D: Music Note E: Piano\nRationales:The words \u201cinstrument\u201d and \u201cdoor\u201d in the question are not clearly defined, and could apply to various contexts.\n\nHowever, one plausible interpretation is that the \u201cinstrument\u201d used to find the door represents a means of navigation, while the door itself represents a place that could be accessed using the instrument. \n\nConsidering this interpretation, Choice A (clock) seems unlikely. A clock, even when referring to a wristwatch, is an inanimate object, unlike the instrument in the question, which is described as an active, animate item.\nOption B (music note) also seems unlikely; music notes do not typically represent a means of navigation, and the idea of navigating to a location using music notes would not make sense.\nOption E (piano) is another unlikely choice; a piano is an inanimate object that cannot be used as a navigational tool.\nOption D (music note) does not make sense as describing a means of navigation.\n\nSo, if we combine this information, all of the remaining choices are plausible in the context of the problem since they are animate objects that, in a broader context, could represent a means of navigation.", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": "-mart snacks, they each held how many cookies. Choices:  A; 4 B; 9 C; 18 D; 27 E; 45\nInput: Which is the most likely response to one of the sentences above? Choices: \nA; Nothing.\nB; A different number.\nC; The second sentence.\nD; I don't know.\nE; The first sentence.\nRationales:\n1. The question is about which of the above sentences is most likely to be responded to by a statement such as \"I don't know\".\n2. To answer this, we need to analyze the sentences given and determine which of them is the most likely to cause confusion or uncertainty in the listener's understanding.\n\n3. Considering that a mini-mart snack bag contains either 4 or 9 cookies, a listener may respond with \"I don't\n know\" if they are unsure what information was meant in the statement. This is because the listener may have\n come across multiple mini-mart snack bags, each with a different number of cookies.\n\n4. Hence, the correct response to the sentence \"Carla bought 2 mini-mart snack\n bags\" is Choice E: The sentence contains information about 2 bags; if each bag contained the same amount of cookies, 2 x 4 = 8,  but each bag contained a different number of cookies, resulting in confusion about the total number. So, the most likely response is choice E: the first sentence.\n\n5. Here, we have the same situation of unknown quantity of cookies in each bag. This leads to confusion and uncertainty\n in the listener's comprehension of the given statement. Therefore, the most likely response by the listener\n is choice A: nothing. The two bags of the snacks each contained a different number of snacks, and the total\n quantity is unknown.\n\n6. Considering that each bag contains either 4, 9 or 18 cookies, a listener may reply with \"I don' t know\"\n if they're confused by the statement. In this scenario, the listener might be unsure about the number of total\n cookies Carla bought (i.e., 4 or 9 or 16 which is 2 x 9), which causes confusion and uncertainty in the listener.", "answer": " 3"}

This task describes a specific bookstore and asks about a specific piece of literature.\n2. In a bookstore, the most popular or best-selling book is likely to be a well-known book that is written by an established author, not by a beginner or unknown writer.\n3. Hence, the answer would be a book written by a popular or established author. \n4. Choice A: by a new author is an incorrect answer as it describes a book written by someone new to writing rather than a popular or established author who is known for producing best-sellers in the bookstore studied.\n5. Choice B: by a popular or established writer is also an incorrect answer as it does not describe the most popular book.\n6. Choice C: By a professional writer is also incorrect, as it does not describe a best seller.\n7. There are various kinds of writers available in the world, and a particular writer's status as an expert or professional is independent of whether their work sells well in a bookstore.\n8. Choice D: in a genre is incorrect because this question asks which type of book, not which genre. A single work of literature can belong to multiple genres, like mystery or thriller.

(10 marks, 1-5 marks)\nThe lion needed 4-5 sticks, which are the branches of trees, leaves as bedding, stones for a waterproof roof, and a tree for a frame. The lion needed these materials because they gave the lion shelter from harsh elements such as winds and rain at night.\n\nWhat did the lions use as bedding? (20 marks, 4-5 marks)\nThey used leaves, because leaves are natural and easy to find. Leaves can also be used as bedding to keep the lion warm when it's cold.\n\nWhat were the problems the lions had that they had to solve to survive? (30 marks, 6-7 marks)\nThe problems the lions had were the harsh conditions during the rain. For example, the lions could get wet very fast. Because of this, they needed to find a place that was dry and warm. To do this, the lions needed a shelter. To build a shelter, the lions needed 4-5 branches, leaves, rocks, and a tree.\n\nHow did the lions make a shelter?

The phrases \"solely off x\" or \"solely x\" indicate that x is the only thing that is responsible.\n\n2. In the given context, James's source of income is exclusively the salary he made from basketball.\n3. Therefore, the answer must be either A: \"a payroll scheme\" or B: \"a salary\".\n\n4. While both terms can signify a source of income, these options are incorrect because they do not specify the source as having exclusively basketball as the salary, making them irrelevant in this case.\n\n5.

Choices: \t A: sand B: an asteroid C: water D: paper E: light\n\n#### Demonstration:Rationales:\n```\n(A) In a simple magnifying glass, lenses such as convex and concave lenses would gather all the light and focus it to a spot in a very small volume. From this point, the light intensity is very high, hence hot enough to melt anything. This is true for sand and all other substances that are organic (plants and animals)\n(B) An asteroid is a small solar system body that follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun. An asteroid is mostly rock-like material which cannot be focused by lenses, but some may also contain organic and inorganic materials that can be focused. However, an asteroid is not found often in the sand.\n(C) Water can be used as a prism or lens to reflect light, but when light is collected at a spot, a very high intensity is not produced since part of the light will be absorbed by the water. To get this high intensity of light, one needs a lot of water and the whole water column needs to be used. Moreover, in most cases light will be scattered when passing through water, but not focused into a small spot. \n(D) In most cases light passes through paper or other forms of matter, thus the", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "263 sheep last year. If he rounded up an average of less than 100 sheep per day last year, the next day he rounded up an average number of more than which? Choices: 1. A: 2. B: 3. C: 4. D: 5. E:\n\nRationales:1. Carla's sheepdog is rounding up an average number of less than 120 sheep per day so that means the previous day he rounds up an average of more than 373 sheep and the next day he rounds up more than double the average.\n2. When you multiply 373 by two, the result is 746 and we need to divide the previous day's average by 746. 3. So, multiplying the previous day's number (373) by 2 and then dividing by 263 will tell us the minimum number. That minimum number turns out to be 1.75 because 373 x 2/263 = 1.75 4. The next day, the dog will round up more than 1.75 sheep because that is the average. The dog will round up 425 in all. 5. One can prove that this method will not apply every day for any average number above 100, so you can rule out choices 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n6.

The question asks how many more minutes will make Roger 4 additional years old.\n2. This is equivalent to asking how many more minutes it takes to age 4 years.\n3. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is the same as 4 x 60 minutes.\n4. There are 24 hours in a day, and it takes one day (86,400 seconds) to age one year.\n5. Therefore, 4 years is (4 x 60) x 86,401 seconds, or 20,558 days, plus the 10 minutes that Roger already rode his bike.\n6. 1.24 years is how many more minutes it will take him to be 4 years older. This is a close approximation because 4 x 61 seconds, the amount left to age 4 years, is 248 seconds (or 4 minutes, 18 seconds).\n7. Hence, the answer choice F: \"Years\" is correct.

Since one plant produces 4 tomatoes, and Andy has 200 plants, he has 200 tomatoes. Option B does not say anything about the size of Andy's garden, so we can multiply the amount of harvested tomatoes by 200 to get 2000. Option C says that each tomato plant matures in 40 days. For each tomato plant, one has to wait 40 days until a new tomato can be harvested. Andy has 20 plants. There are at least two harvests for each plant because you cannot harvest after the first 40 days. So Andy has to wait at least 80 days before his last plants reach maturity and can be harvested, and wait another 80 days until the next year. This means that, each day from April to September he has at least two plants which can be harvested in a week.\nOption D says that each tomato needs at least 40 to mature. All his mature plant need at least 80 to mature. So each day from April to August, at least a plant from his 200 plant needs at least 2 days before it can be harvested (40+2). So Andy has to wait 80 days for each plant to mature. This means that everytime he has at least two harvestable tomato plant. Andy will always have at least two harvest in the week, since he has to wait 8 days before a newly born plant can be harvested until he has at least two at any time.

Option B: Snowstorm is also not an appropriate term for the question because it is describing only a situation where a large number of snow are accumulating in front yards.\n4.

{"text": "has 34 dice. How many more dice does Jerry have than Ivan? Choices: 1. None 2. Two 3. Three 4. Four 5. More then 4\nRationales:1. None: This is a possible answer choice but is incorrect because one way to think about this puzzle is a comparison between Ivan and Jerry, which requires that there be more than two people involved in the question. Furthermore, even if there were only two dice, one solution could be that they have the same number.\n2. Two: By looking at each of their dice rolls, you can see that Ivan's number exceeds Jerry by exactly two dice.\n3. Three: Also by observation, we can see that each dice has an equal probability of being rolled. Since Ivan starts with 20 dice, there is a 20% chance that he rolls at least one six (and the same goes for Jerry with his 34 dice). Thus, Ivan doesn't have more than three dice that are a 6. If he rolled one die, there would be a 5% chance that it's a six. However, given Ivan's 20 dice, he has a 50% chance of having one six. This is the reason Jerry has three dice that are a six and Ivan does not.\n4. Four: Jerry has four dice that are a 1, 2, 3, or 4, while Ivan does not. As we do for the three dice case, we look at the probability of an individual dice roll for any of these four dice. We begin by observing that rolling one dice has a 1/6, or 16.6%, probability of being a 6. Taking into account how much Ivan has of these dice shows that there is a 1/12, or 8.3%, chance of him rolling one dice. Taking the probability for all four dice together, we have a 1/64, or 1.6%, chance that all four dice that are 1, 2s, 3s, or 4s would be rolled from 20 dice.\n\n### What if a question is asked with an \"Expect the Unexpected\" answer\n\n* For this question, the question and answer is 9.00 cm, therefore 5 cm is 20% of it", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "k and lace. Which does a dress have that your pants don't? Choices:  Alex_Silk_Lace.png\nRationales: Alex answers with luxury dresses out. She doesn't mention pants, so dresses must include things that pants don't. 1. We know because she doesn't mention, she doesn't know about them. She tells us in the question that she can't tell us what pants don't have.\n2. So we can eliminate any answer that mentions something a dress doesn't but you don't know. So, Alex doesn't know about her dresses' collar and pockets, they'll be part of the answer. \n3. She didn't say neck, belly button or pants either. The neck is in the pants, the bellybutton is in the dress so it will be also part of the answer.\n4. So, pants are made with, silk, lace, collar, pocket and belly button. So, the dress has all of them and therefore your pants don' be part of the answer, Answer is in a dress. Your pants don't be mentioned because luxury dresses out are the same.\nAnswer: She doesn't know the neck and pants. Your pants don have that.

How many clusters must you buy to have 3?\n\n### Explanation:\nWe need to buy x clusters that are equal sized, thus we can choose 3 clusters\n\nThe question asks to consider each bucket or cluster in the set. 30 is not an even number, so each cluster must contain at least 2 objects and at most 20 objects in order to divide by 3 to get evenly spaced clusters. \n\nSo, there are only 5 clusters that evenly spaces out our 30 items.\n\nIt is possible to have an odd number of clusters and only 2 groups of 15 can evenly share without overlaps and without buying any additional clusters:\n\n- 0 clusters, you can make 4 groups of 7 (15/2 + 15/2 +15/2 + x)\n- 1 cluster, you can make 3 groups of 7 (7 + 7) and 3 of 4 (7/3 + 7/3)\n- 2 clusters, you can make either 2 groups of 8 or 2 groups of 6 (6/2 + 6/3 + x = 8/3)\n\nHowever, we need even numbers of clusters to split the 15/2 evenly spaced.\n\nAnswer:\n3\n\n# 22\n\n```\nInput: Which of these is an example of a homonym?\nchoices: A: pizza  B: pane C: pine D: plum D: plume\nRationales:\n1. homonyms are words that sound the same but have different meanings.\n2. \"pizza\" is an English word (word with English origin) not the same as \"pizza\" in Italian (word with Italian origin).\n3. \"pane\" and \"pizza\" also have different origin stories.\n4. \"pizza\" in English generally denotes a flat circular piece of Italian bread topped with tomato sauce, toppings of choice and cheese.\n5. \"pine\" refers to either an evergreen coniferous tree or pine cones.\n6. \"plume\" refers to feathers or a group of feathers such as wings on a bird, whereas \"plum\" can mean either", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "as does Tess. What time of day is it today? Choices: \ud83d\udca0A: afternoon B: night C: morning D: evening\n\nRationales:1. The question says that Bella has twice as many marbles as Tess. \n2. Tess having zero marbles is implied by this, so the total number of marbles she has is two.\n3. So, Tess has marbles, and B has marbles. Bella's marbles are one more than Tess's, meaning that Bella has more marbles than the two half as many marbles that Tess has. \n4. This means that there aren't as many marbles in Bella's possession as in Tess's possession, but the number of marbles in Bella\u2019s possession is still more than one third of Tess\u2019s. \n5. Now we have determined the difference in number of marbles between the two. Therefore we know that Tess has one less than two thirds the total number of marble that Bella has. (Bella has 2 marbles, and Tess has 1.)\n6. Taking the total number of marbel Bella has, which is twice the total number of marbales Tess has, we can solve for the total number of marboles Tess has. Taking half of two, we get 1. We multiply two by half and add 1. We get 2.75. 2.75 x 2 is equal to 5.5, and Bella has 2. So therefore Tess has 5.5.\n7.

An office is an area in a building that is used for administrative or professional purposes, but a pencil typically isn't used in a work setting. Hence it is eliminated as an option.\n5. A pencil is usually a small, cylindrical object with a graphite writing tip, but \"pencil\" alone is simply the name of the device. Hence, answer B: pencil is a better description for the object in the question.\nAnswer: B; Pencil\n\nInput:A boy uses a book for school and not for learning. In which location is the book normally used? Choices: A. desk B. school C. library D. kitchen E. bedside table\nRationales:1. The question describes how a desk is sometimes also used for learning, which indicates that, besides at school, it can be used elsewhere such as the library, kitchen, and bedside table.\n2. A library is a public or private collection of books where anyone can come and borrow or sell them. Since it is for public use, it does not make sense for a book to be primarily used for learning.\n3. \"Kitchen\" and \"bedside table\" can be used for reading", "answer": " 204"}
{"text": "plate, how many people are eating 3 meatballs? Choices:  Option A: 3 people B: 7 people\n### Rationales:\nThere are three meatballs on each of three plates. This means there are nine meatballs. It's not stated that each plate is being served one meatball, so it's not clear what kind of meatball plates are being used. If the plates contain nine meatballs (one for each person)... then this means 3 (people) * 3 (plats) = 9 (meatballs). So, answer will be option B: 7 people. But if the plates are 1 meatball each...\n1. A: 3 people would eat 1 / 3 =.33 meatballs each and 3 *.33 = 1 meatball. Thus, 3 people eat one meatball each.\n2. B: 7 people eat 7 * 3 = 21 meatballs each. 21 meatball per plate means there is about 7 meatballs per plate, so each person gets 7 meatballs.", "answer": " 3"}

Option A: \"shine\" does not generally describe the change that happens when an object is heated. It could be a possible answer, but it is not strongly supported.\n4. Option B: \"sigh\" doesn't make sense because fries do not sigh. If something is sighing, it means it is giving out a long, low, or soft sound, which fries do not do.\n5.

This is generally interpreted as something that appears opaque and of moderate brown, which does not make sense for fries given that they are usually transparent and have a yellow or white hue.\n6.

Exercising can strain or cause an injury to a muscle, but a stiff muscle won't lead to an injury. This indicates that muscles will not lead to an injury.\n5. Hence, we can conclude that when James hurt himself exercising, he did not suffer an injury because of stiff muscles.\n6.

{"text": "wide and 3 inches tall in the center of the page. The page has two other rectangles of equal width and equal height below the central rectangle. In what order do they appear on the page? Choices: \n\nA: right, down, up, left\nB: left, up, right, down\nC: right, down, left, up\nD: left, down, up, right\nE: right, down, right, down\nRationales:\n1. The question describes the layout of a rectangle that is split into two equal rectangles on each side.\n2. The central rectangle is 3 inches x 4 inches. Then, below it are two other identical rectangles, such that the two side rectangles are also equal in width and height to each other.\n3. This implies that the layout of the figure and the order of rectangles in the layout could be represented by a matrix. \n4. We can then order the rectangles as rows and columns (i.e., the matrix) in a 3x4 arrangement for the central rectangle and three other 3x3 rectangles below it.\n5. This yields the following matrix representation of the rectangle layout:\n6. [\n\n  A   B   C\n\n  D\n\n  E\n\n]\n7. Now, we want to order the rectangles into an ascending order of their appearance on a page. For this, we will consider the topmost box in which the first rectangle will represent the order that it would appear on the page. Choices A, B, C, and D represent the appearance of the first rectangle. \n8. Looking at choices A: \"right, down, up, then left\", option A has the right rectangle on the bottom left and up from there. While up can be used in this context to represent either left or right, this order seems counterintuitive since from the top rectangle A is down to B. \n9. Looking at option B: \"left, then up, down, right\" it seems like a better fit (up can, again, be used to mean either right or left) in terms of order.\n10. Choices C and D have the right rectangle being placed to the left of the B rectangle, which would actually represent a right to left order in which the other rectangles appear.\n11.

Two are named Bo and Duke.\n3. The third dog is not named Bo or Duke.\n4. If Hannah has three dogs, it would follow that the third dog likely also belongs to Hannah, thus excluding A: Huck and C: Emmy.\n5. Option Luke is the name of a dog that Hannah is not associated with, so it does not belong to Hannah and therefore cannot be the third dog.\n6. This leaves us with B: Duke and D: Hannah.

{"text": "### Demontration: \nInput: How might you describe a dog walker? Choices:  L: professional pet sitter C: pet groomer G: pet boarding B: pet-sitting attendant D: puppy walker\nRationales: Linguistic knowledge can aid us in answering the description of a dog walker in more specific terms than the provided choices below:\n1. A dog walker is a person who takes care of dogs by walking them, or taking them for walks. \n2. One way to describe a dog walker would be through the verb form, \u201cto be a dog walker\u201d. In this case, this form of speaking is known as an elliptical form.\n3. The purpose of an elliptical form is to simplify speech while retaining its meaning. When describing someone\u2019s occupation, the phrase \u201cdog walker\u201d is used which implies the profession and is equivalent to \u201cto be a dog \u2026\u201d.\n4. This type of simplified sentence structure is seen in this example where the main idea is \u201cMariel, the dog walker, is taking care of dogs.\n5. A person can also be described as a dog walker through the gerund \u201cdog walking\u201d which functions in speech the same as \u201cdog walker\u201d but also contains extra information in its meaning, such as the gerund \u201cdog walks\u201d implies that the dog walker is actively doing something. \n6. This means that Mariel is walking dogs. For gerunds, one can also use the pronoun \u201cit\u201d instead of \u201cdog\u201d. \n7. Therefore the phrase \u201cMariel, the it \u2026\u201d, or \u201cMariel is it \u2026\u201d could also describe Mariel\u2019s occupation.\n8. Another way to describe Mariel is as \u201c\u2026 attendant\u201d or \u201c\u2026 sitter\u201d which simply means \u201c\u2026 worker\u201d. \n9. These specific phrases could be useful where the type of work is not obvious and this wording can aid in more specific clarification.\n10. Therefore, option G: pet groomer G is incorrect because the term \u201csitter\u201d does not mean worker.\n11. Option B: pet-siting attendant D does not provide any information about the type of occupation.\n12.

Option A: The firmament refers to the vast expanse of the universe above us; which is also an expanse like the sky.\n2. Option B: The word \"starry\" does not convey the meaning of large and infinite as found in \"firmament\". Therefore, (0) this option is not the closest word to \"firmament\".

Nostalgic refers to feeling nostalgic.\n2. When asked about feelings towards her home, the closest options in the choice would be nostalgic for and nostalgic.\n3. Of the two options, \"nostalgia\" refers to \"feeling nostalgic\", and \"nostalgic for\" refers to feeling nostalgia towards.\n4.

{"text": "from swallowing too many of those gummy worms what part is responsible? Choices: 1. stomach 2. esophagus 3. larynx 4. throat 5. trachea 6. pharynx\n\nRationales:1. The question is in reference to the digestion process, which occurs in several parts of the body.\n2. The process includes the stomach, which takes in and breaks down food, and the esophagus, which acts as a muscular tube that connects the throat to the stomach and can become inflamed or irritated from overuse or injury.\n3. Other body parts that may also be affected by overeating are the larynx, which is responsible for vocal coughs and the production of noises, and the trachea, which supplies air to the lungs and protects them from foreign particles.\n4. Additionally, the pharynx is the passageway that leads from the throat to the esophagus and is often referred to as the food pipe or throat.\n5. Finally, the thorax, or chest area, is home to the heart and is not typically involved in digestive processes.\n6. Based on these descriptions, the correct answer is 1. stomached, which is where food is digested and contains enzymes that break down food into nutrients like proteins, fats, carbohydrates, and vitamins.\n\nAnswer: 1.

The question asks which of five smartphones does not belong, based on the assumption that all five are of the same type.\n2. Looking at each of the five options, it is known that all of them except one could be the right choice.\n3. Since this question is presented as a general multiple choice question with choices A, B, C, D and E, the choices given must either belong to the same class of type (e.g. the same brand) or have one stand out from the others (e.g. by being notably different).\n4. Comparing each choice to the others, it can be seen that only Samsung does not belong to the same class as Apple- they are smartphone manufacturers not Apple, whereas the others belong to the same type (all being smartphones from various brands), or are very similar in that they are all branded by different countries (e.g. Motorola and Dell). \n5.

Her amount of dollars is not equal to her amount of things.\n\n### Intructions:\n1. The question is whether or not Sandi can buy anything with 6 hundred dollars.\nThis means that we are looking for answers where Sandi can afford to purchase something with 6 hundred dollars, if the items are worth less than 6 hundred dollars. She cannot buy something for 6 hundred dollars, because that means she does not have enough money.\n\n2. Option 1: pennies, does not make sense as pennies are worth of each 100 dollars. When you multiply 6 hundred times 100 you get 60 thousand, so the 60 sandi has, is not enough to buy anything with pennies.\n\n3. Option 2: dimes, could work, because 60 dimes are 600 sandi, this means with 600 dollars Sandi does have enough dimes to buy anything with dimes.\n\n4.

Sue's salary is described as \"5,900\" every two days, indicating that she works a five-day work week.\n2. This leads us to the question of how many working days are in two weeks?\n3. Answers to this question fall into two categories:\n4. We can determine that A: minutes, B: seconds, and E: seconds can be ruled out because 3600 seconds = 1 hour and 24 hours = 2 days = 4800 seconds.\n5. Answer C: hours is incorrect because there are 168 hours in a 2 week period.\n6. If you add 16 days of work (5 days x 3 days), you get 1664 working hours for Sue, who works five days per week.\n7. Hence, the answer could be either 168 working hours or 1664.\n8. We know that any integer greater than 1 is a multiple of 24, so we can write 168 = 24 x 7, and 1664 = 24 x x 73.\n9. Then, 168 - 1664 must be the remainder, or difference between 24 x 28.\n10. So, the answer is A and B. The answer is \"minutes\".

If Lake Crystal has ten percent fewer frogs than it did last year, then ten percent of last year's total number of frogs must have been removed. \n1. Therefore, let's suppose the Lake had 100 frogs last year.\n2. We know its total frogs now is 80 frogs.\n3. If this is only a ten percent decrease, then 20 frogs must have been eliminated.\n4. So, we have 100 - 20 = 80 frogs remaining now.\n5. Therefore, there are only 80 frogs in Lake Crystal now, indicating a decrease of 20 frogs.\n6. Let's check the choices:\n7. A: three percent greater frogs. This is an increase of three percent or 3/100 of a percent. Since we've already said this question is a decrease of 2/100, this can't be correct and is dismissed.\n8. B: fifteen percent more frogs. If Lake Crystal had fifteen percent more frogs, then it should now have fifteen percent more frogs than it did in the old amount. This also leads to the same contradiction as above.\n9. C: fifteen percent fewer frogs. If the number of frogs have decreased by fifteen percent, then the total number of frogs should have become 40 less than it was before. However, our numbers above indicate it has been decreased by 20. Hence, this can't possibly be the answer and is dismissed\n10. D: ten percent fewer frogs.

Consider \"local loop\"- it can refer to a circular route that one might take for exercise or transportation, but it does not specifically describe a path that is commonly used.  \n4. As for \"the scenic route\"- while a scenic area could be incorporated into a running route, a scenic route itself is not commonly used for exercise or transportation unless one is traveling to reach a destination.  \n5. \"The straight run\" can refer to an uninterrupted path, but it does not indicate that this route is commonly used for exercise or traveling. \n6. \"The long legs\" could describe an extended route, but it does not refer to any specific area or common use.\n7. Finally, \"the best distance\" does not specify a specific path or route, and it cannot be definitively inferred if the person has already run the route.\n8.

If we consider the first essay it is evident that it has 3,000 words and 66.7% means 2,040 out of 3000, this means 640 word and this means the essay has just written 640 words.\n5.

His paintings are also described as creative which means they are not just ordinary or ordinary-looking, but have some sort of artistic flair.\n3. However, he is not self-tought, which means he learned to paint from other people and did not teach himself how to paint. \n4. In terms of making it up as he goes, Noah is a traditional painter who uses known techniques and known mediums to paint his work. He does not follow a non-traditional approach in his painting style.\n5. Lastly, it is not known if Noah makes paintings that he knows people will want or not. The given information does not explicitly state that he does or does not, leaving this choice unclear.\n1. Noah is described as a traditional painter, rather than a modern or digital one who breaks the norms and follows their own style instead. \n2. Since Noah is a traditional artist, he would need to paint the conventional way using known techniques and ingredients in order to earn a living. This restricts his creativity somewhat in that there are limits to what he can express artistically. \n3. As a result, while he may be creative with his paint, he is not as creative as a non-traditional artist who can do anything in the digital medium or one who experiments with bizarre techniques that are not found in traditional art.\n4.

This is incorrect because all students do not know how Mr. Sanchez wants to conduct the exam. Therefore, not all students can know less.

Aaron started with $220 in his inventory which has been reduced by the costs incurred. \n2. $80 is already reduced from $220 and when Aaron sells the $220 worth, at least 15% profit will be made, hence $31 is profit. \n3.

D: Paityn has ___ __ hats,__ but she only wants to ____. E: She will ______.\nRationales:\n1. There is an error in the sentence structure of choice A. We have the sentence \u201cPaityn has __ hatts__\u201d. However, the sentence should be either \"Paityn has __ 20 red htas__\" or \"Paityn has 5 __ __ 20 red hat__s__.\" There is no proper subject in the sentence, and the verb and the two predicates are not conjugated properly.\n2. In Choice B, the sentence is similar to Choice A. Here, the sentence includes an error in the structure: \u201cShe's __going__ the party.\u201d Instead, the sentence should include \"She is __going__ the party.\" There is no subject, and the predicate is not conjugated. \n3. Answer Choice C should be removed because the sentence uses incorrect contraction in its verb form. For instance, in this part of the sentence \u201c_She's___ the party\u201d, the verb should be \u201cshe is\u201d, instead of \u201c_she's_,\u201d.\n4. Choice D is incorrect because it is not clear of what \u201cshe\u201d refers to. The sentence might sound like \u201cPaityn has 7 hats, but she only wants 5.\u201d However, it is more likely that the speaker is referring to \u201cshe,\u201d and thus, 5 hats should belong to \u201cPaityn\u201d, as stated in the question.\n5 Choice E states \"She will __ come\".

{"text": "25 pounds, the cows on a dairy farm are what? Choices: A: fat B: skinny C: tiny D: heavy E: bony\nRationales:\n1. John's cow weighing 425 pounds is an indication for John's cow to be quite heavy and the cows on a farm to not be lightweight.\n2. Hence, the appropriate choice for the situation is D: heavy.\n\nInput:Which of the following would not make John angry? Choices:  B: good news C: compliments D: criticism E: insults\nRationales:Input: John was angry.\n1. John was angry so we don't expect anything good to make John happy.\n2. Complements are unlikely to make someone angry and are good news.\n3. Criticism is not necessarily a guarantee for making John angry so we don' know for sure if it would or would not.\n4. John might be angry if we criticise him but he can also be angry if his friend praises him, for being a critic.\n5. John might not be angry if someone criticises him for something he is not responsible for.\n6. In contrast, insults could be an option and are definitely something that would make John angry.\n7.

His salary and his car are both things that are necessary for John to survive and are important to him so these answers cannot be the solution.\n3. He could certainly enjoy both of these things and might enjoy them more if they were considered important, but this does not mean they are important.\n4.

{"text": "larger tank is 20 inches in length, 10 inches in width, and 4 inches in depth. The smaller tank is 10 inches in length, four inches in width, and two inches in depth. The larger fish tank has more water than the smaller fish tank.\nWhat is the capacity of the larger fish tank as measured in gallons?\nRationales:\n1. The capacity of the fish tank\n2. We are given the dimensions of the fish tanks, in inches.\n3. The volume of a fish tank is calculated by using the formula:\n```\n Volume =  Length * Width * Height\n```\nwhere height would be represented by the depth value, since we are given the height in this case.  \n\n4. For this problem, volume should be expressed in units of gallons. Therefore, we will divide volume by 231.\n5. When we subtract the smaller tank's capacity from the larger one, we get the larger fish tank's capacity:\n```\nCapacity = (Capacity of Larger Fish Tank) - (Capacity of Smaller Fish Tank)\n```\n6. We can solve this problem by re-writing the formula and solving for 'capacity':\n```\n Volume = Length * Width * Depth \n                   = 30 * 15 * 4\n Volume = 500\n Capacity = Volume / 231\n```\n7.

We are given the tank is one foot.  \n2. We can also think of this problem by calculating the area of the tank:\n```\nArea =  Length * (Length) +  Width *  (Width)\n```\nwhere one foot would be represented by width (1 ft) and 2 feet by height (2 ft) in our problem.\n3.

{"text": "looking into a yard with two rabbits inside.\n\n### Input Rationale: This passage reads like a story or poem, and has a lot of unnecessary fluff to try and get you to answer the question wrong.

Simply focus on the actual words.\n\n### Question: Which animal is describing the other?\n\n### Choices: Dog (B), Rabbit (D), Cat (E), Horse (G), Snake (H)\n\n### Explanation:\nYou're trying to identify the animal who was sitting on the fence and watching the other animals.\nThis would be the first question your teacher or your parent asks you when you try to describe something that you see. \"Who was on the chair?\" This question is the same as the one you've been given here.\nIf none of these animals could be watching the other animals, what would a cat, cat, a horse, or a snake do at a fence?  You need to choose the one that cannot be assumed. The cat has nothing to do with grass, the horse could be grazing, the dog could be chasing rabbits, the snake could be doing something that the cat is doing, and this is the exact same question. So the rabbit was sitting in the yard. This is the right answer.\n\n### Excellent: D. The rabbits were in the grass, while the cat was sitting on the fense, looking into the yard with the grass. It was a grassy area, while the dog was still with the rabbit. So the rabbits stayed put. They stayed in the yard and that was a \"horse\" place, because the dog was in the grass. The snake was on the fence, and the grass was nearby. The snake was looking at the dog. The rabbits were probably grazing.\n\n### Poor: B. No cat would ever be on a fence. Cats don't climb, they jump. The dog is in the yard, but the cat is on the fence. This seems more like a question about cats and horses. You're not sure what they're looking at, you just need to know who is looking at what. Cats are also known to eat rabbits", "answer": " 55"}

Choices:  D: awake C: waking up B: conscious A: walking B: sleepwalking E: dreaming\nRationales:\n1. If something is asleep, this means that it is not awake.\n2. This is generally used to refer to animals, plants or inanimate objects that lack the awareness and control in their movements that we normally associate with consciousness.\n3. The choices given include a wide range of possibilities, all of which could possibly be accurate or inaccurate depending on the context in which they are used.\n4. It is useful to consider each choice in turn and compare it to how we would use the term \"asleep\" in a sentence: \n5. Option A: walking is not possible, as walking requires awareness and control within one's movements. For example: \"The dog was walking around the house.\" or \"How is the girl that you met last night doing? She was walking like a lady.\"\n6. Option B: sleepwalking often involves movements that are unconscious rather than controlled. So option B might be correct in some cases, such as: \"The boy was sleepwalking in his bed,\" or \"I was sleepwalking to the fridge.\" \n7. Option C: a conscious response would be required for biscuits to be classified as baked goods. To bake biscuits, one would need to use awareness to make various decisions about ingredients, temperature, and time. Baking has too much cognitive thinking for biscuits to potentially be referred to as \"baked goods\". \n8.

Choices:  X: Zero A: Twice B: Half C: All D: None E: None of these\nRationales:\n1. A die is a cube-shaped object with six identical sides, each marked with one to six pips (dies) which represent the numbers one through six.\n2. We can assume that there are no biases or unpredictable events such as a sudden wind change that might influence the result before or during the roll.\n3. Then, the odds of winning can be calculated using the probability formula.\n\nProbability of Winning = Number of Successes / Total Number of Outcomes\n\nNumber of Success = 1 Dice = 1\n\nTotal Number of Outcomes = 1 Dice X 6 Die Sides = 6\n\nProbability = 1 Success / 6 Trials \u2248 1/6 = 16.67 % Odd\n\n4. Now let us analyse the answer choices to solve the question.\n\nA: Twice, B: Half, D: None, E: None of these.\n\nIf all the dice have faces with the same amount of pips, then a fair amount of success is half of the sum of the amount of pips on all the dice faces. This is 2 because there are 6 pips on each 1-6 face. 2 / 6 = 0.33333.\n\nA fair amount of success if all the dice does not have the same amount of pipped faces is when it is 1.25 ( 1.5 = 2, divided by 2) because it is a fair and balanced amount of dice pipping. 1.25 / 6 = 1.72417\n\nWe choose answer C: All if a die has the same amount of numbers on each face( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6).

{"text": "many trees, and a river nearby. An animal might be sitting in that section without worrying about being caught because they are ______________. Choices:  A. camouflaged  B. hidden  C. safe  D. comfortable  E. secure\nRationales:1. The question is concerned with the characteristics that allow an animal to remain in a forest area without worrying about being discovered.\n2. We are provided with a section of a forest where there are many trees and a river nearby.\n3. The word \"camouflaged\" refers to an animal that uses natural features of its environment, like colors and patterns, to hide from predators.\n4. So, option A: \"Camouflaged\", would be an appropriate way in which an animal might remain undiscovered in a section of the forest.\n5. Option \"E: secure\" is also applicable since animals are secure in the forest because the predators cannot reach them easily.\n6. However, options \"A\". \"B\", \"C\" and \"E\" do not describe the means by which an animal stays undiscovered.\n7. Option d: \"comfortable\" is also inappropriate as this does not refer to hiding from predators.\n8. Hence the best choice is A: \"camouflaged\", as an animal can remain secure in a section of the forrest without being noticed since a forest is typically a place where there are many trees.\n\nAnswer: A.camouflaged\n\n###Instruction: A farmer is putting his cows in the field.

Which method of solving the story could the reader use to determine that Gary lost $300 on the deal, $800 below its selling price and $400 less than what he needed to replace the broken parts?\n\n### Demostration:  Input: When people decide on a new car, it can sometimes be difficult to determine which one to choose. There can be many different factors involved in choosing a specific car. Choices:  A:\"Luxury\" B:\"Interior Design\" C:\"Power\" D:\"Sporty\"\nRationales: Let's look at the choices and their rationales:\n1. Choice A: \"Luxury\"- This is a quality often associated with higher-end vehicles. It's not directly related to the car's performance, but it does affect the aesthetic appeal, and hence may be a factor considered in some people's decisions.\n2. Choice B: Interior Design\"- This includes options like color, style, and materials used to create the interior of a car. It can certainly be an attractive feature for some people but doesn't necessarily affect the engine or other physical qualities of a vehicle.\n3. Choice C:\"Power\"- This indicates an emphasis on a car's engine and performance, which can be a significant factor in choosing a certain vehicle.\n4. Choices D:\"Sporty\"\"This suggests a focus on style in terms of design, often with the goal of making a vehicle appear faster, sleeker, or more agile.\n5. Let's consider the context of the story. Gary is interested in buying a used car, which is presumably of lower quality than a new car. Also, he has a budget of $1,00. He later sells the car to Tom but receives just $700 instead of $1,050.\n6. Based on the clues provided, we can surmise that Gary ultimately chose a car based on its power and sportiness, thinking that these features would make it more appealing in the marketplace. \n7.

{"text": "$3.99 each, at what did he pay more? Choices: A: 2 bags of chips B: tax C: a sandwich D: a hat E: a shirt\nRationales:1. If Benny bought 2 soft drinks for 2 bags of $3.99 chips each, this means he spent $7.98 on the chips.\n2. To determine the cost of the soft drinks,  we need to subtract this total amount of $7.98 from the cost ($11.97) of buying 2 soft drinks = $3.99*.\n3. Next, subtract this amount of $3.98 from the original cost of the soft drink: 2 soft drinks at $3.99 = $7.98.\n4. This leaves us with the difference of $3.90 between the cost of buying 2 bottles of soft drinks and the soft drinks that Benny actually purchased. Benny pays more due to the difference of $3:.90 in the amount he pays for buying 2 soft  drinks compared to the money he spent on the chips. \n5. Hence, D: \"more\" = Benny paid additional funds. \n6. Option C is incorrect because paying a tax is not equivalent to paying Benny more money.\n7. Options A: \"2 bags of\" and B: \"a sandwich\" do not correctly relate to the context as the answer choice.\n8. Option C: \"hats\" is also incorrect as it is not a reasonable answer choice.\n9.

This information does not tell us anything about the location of the people it serves. They could be homeless people living in the community, or they could be people from out of town who have been displacing and are temporarily staying at the shelter.\n### Option B: It's a community centre for the local homeless\n### Demonstartion: The phrase \"community centre\" indicates a place where community members gather or interact. While sheltering them may be a service that the community provides, it does not necessarily mean that the people in question are from the community.\n### Option C: It's a shelter for people in need\n### Demonstraion: While the shelter provides a service to anyone in need, it does not specify where those in question are from.\n### Option D: So, where are they form?\n### Demostration: The phrase \"so, where are they from\" assumes that the people who are served by the shelter are from a specific location or origin.

The three options that are not selected are tea, snack, and pizza. It could be possible that either of these options is the one chosen by Andy, but it is less likely as these are not what Andy ordered.\n3. For the remaining options, we do not have much to work with. The option with the most context clues is E: something. If Bob were to order something different, it would have to be different from what Andy ordered. \n4.

If Bob ordered a different thing, it would have to not be the same as what Andy ordered and pizza is often associated with lunch and eating at a table.\n5.

Tony can be assumed to have a positive impression of his dentist at the moment since he agreed to make an appointment with them.\nNow, the situation can be divided into multiple time periods. These periods are Tony's day today, the previous day before he sees the dentist, and the next day after he sees the dentist.\n### In the day before the appointment:\nAll the choices mention activities that Tony can do during the day before and also after the appointment, apart from knowing or learning more about his dentist. These activities could include studying or video-making.\n### The previous day before the appointment: 1. The most likely possibility in this time period would be to make an appoitment or to learn more about one's dentist. 2. This is why A is a possible activity, and so is C, but B and E are irrelevant in this time period. 3. Also, the time period between yesterday and tomorrow is likely to be quite a short while.

First answer:\n\t- When two numbers are multiplied, their value is still present in the answer, in the same form.\n2. For this question, the key is to identify the correct numbers for the variables and work backwards. For each, we can plug in the values for the given variables to give us an expression to work with. For example, for Bush and Matt, we can say that \"Bush will run __ hours\", in our case \"72\" minutes. \n3.

For choices A, C and B, each of them have 3 trees which are smaller than the trees planted by Andrew and Bill (9 trees). Hence, their green spaces would not be bigger than theirs. 2. Therefore, the answer to choice 1 is answer A, or John, as he owns the biggest space. \n3. Similarly, choice 2 for \"Andrew\" does not work either, as his green space contains a smaller number of trees. It is choice B: \"George\" as he owns the three largest green spaces, followed by Andrew 47 trees, and John's 42 trees. \n4. Option D: \"All 3 are of equal sizes\" is incorrect because the space owned by Andrew and Bill is smaller compared to John's space, as well as George's. \n5. The same logic applies to choice E: \"None.\" While Andrew and his group have the smallest space, their area cannot be classified as zero. \n6.

He would not likely be selling pizzas right as he wakes up.\n5.Option C: \"call 8 hotline\", is a poor choice because a hotline is for people who are having health and life related emergencies, not for selling pizzas.\n6.Option D: \"get dressed\", again does not pertain to selling pizza, so it gets eliminated.\n7.What about option E: \"put a few pill on paper\"? At first, this seems like a reasonable answer; put a few pills up on paper and you could potentially sell them.

Aisle B describes a row with 2 seats side-by-side or 3 seats end-to-end, separated by an aisle (like a hallway or walkway).\n5. Similarly, Row D and 1 row D could also be deemed correct since they are also related to rows.\n6. However, Rows D and E are incorrect because they are not describing an ordered set of seats.\n7.

'Wall' does not lead us to a conclusion because sharks might swim up against one, fall into one, or swim under one, but it does not rule out having fins on them.\n5. Therefore, we must assume the fin has fallen off the shark and is not attached to it, which makes it difficult to discern exactly where we can find one.\n6.

{"text": "feed an army. Choices:  A. castle B. army C. provisions D. king E. kingdom\n1. The entire premise of the question hinges upon how \"provisions\" are meant in the context of a castle.\n2. Since the phrase \"in a castle\" is an adverbial phrase, it modifies an entire noun phrase namely \"provisions\". This would imply \"provisions\" refers to the resources and goods that are regularly found in a castle.\n3. And since \"an army\" is a subjective noun phrase, this would imply that the provisions in the castle at that day could be enough to feed \"an army\" at that point in time and space.\n4. As for choices \"A, B, E\", \"A\" contradicts the adverbial phrase since it doesn't refer to a castle.\n5. \"B\" and \"E\" do not logically refer to provisions since they would be subject and objective noun phrases respectively.\n6. But \"C\" could refer to provisions since it would take the role of an adverbial phrase as well.\n7. And \"D\" could refer to a king since it would refer to the subject of a noun phrase, albeit it doesn't make sense to say that the king is enough to feed an army.\n8. Hence the answer is \"C\", as \"provisions\" can be said to be enough to feed \"in a castle\" at a point in time.\n9. And thus, it would be D: \"provisions\" which is enough to feed an \"army\".\n10.

Choices: 1: fruit 2 : a food 3: a product 4: a supplement 5: a food item\nRationales: The choices provided offer different types of food that one might add to a baking powder. Let's start by eliminating options that are clearly incorrect or do not fit the context of \"adding to a baking powders\".\n\nFruit is a food item and would therefore not need adding to a baking poweder.\n\nFood is a broader term that would include not just fruits but also vegetables, meats, breads, and the like. These are not specifically associated with baking and would not be relevant for the question.\n\nSupplements and food items are both items that could potentially include fruits. We can also eliminate this option since it's possible for an item to be a fruit only, meaning that it is not technically a supplement or a food item.\n\nA similar possibility is a food itself, as in \"the food is apples and apples are fruits\". The problem however with this phrase is that when there is a pronoun of \"itself\" in front of the noun, the noun becomes both a pronoun and a noun. \"Itself\" cannot be used to refer to the noun in question because it already refers to the noun: \"the food itself is...\". This means that answer option b: \"a food\" would be the wrong answer.\n\nBaking powder is another term that refers to something specifically used in home", "answer": " 18"}

Students should be taught to analyze the text, to consider the author's effectiveness in conveying the intended meaning, to identify how it may or may not have achieved the author's purpose, and to assess its efficiency and efficiency.\n\n####Teaching point 2: Author's Intentionality\nAuthors have several intentionalities when creating art, which can involve different goals, such as entertainment, informational, instructional, persuasive, or communicational. Students should be made aware of and able to recognize these intentionalities, as well as how they may or may not be achieved.\n\n####Tutorial: \n####Input: Which of these choices most closely matches the meaning of the poem \"I'll think ___ __ __ __ __ _______\"? \nChoices: A: in a single direction B: with a certainty C: in an infinite number of ways D: in a positive way E: toward a particular goal\nRationales", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "watts of power. What does this mean? Choices: 0 watts,10 watts, 9 watts, 100 watts,  1000 watts\nRationales:1. In response to Kim\u2019s question about the relationship between watts of power and water consumption, the following response would be most accurate:Kim\u2019s television uses 12 wats/hour/foot, which is equal to 12watts. Hence Kim\u2019s TV uses 175 x 12 watt/foot x 1 hour =12 wattsof power. If we simplify that, it\u2019s equal to 175 x12 watt/hour. If you simplify it even more. we\u2019re left with 175 x watt/foot. If we finally simplify, we find that it equals 1 foot.\n2. The answer choices provided are watts, 0 watts (a negative number) and a number that is not a watt of power, namely 9 watts.\n3. Option A:0 Watt is incorrect because zero is a negative number.\n4. Option B:10 watts is also incorrect because it is a very small positive number.\n5. Option D:1000 Watts is not mathematically possible as it is more than 2 orders of magnitude larger than the maximum values possible.\n6. Option E: 9watts is likewise not mathematically possible as 9 watts is only an approximation of a single watt and is much too imprecise.\n7. The answer is A: option watts. Watts is a well-established unit of power, where 1watt = 1 joule/second. Thus, Kim's TV uses1watts of power.\nAnswer: A. Watts\n\n### Demostration:\n\nIn response to the question on the use of power and power consumption, there is a possible explanation in the form of an equation:\n\nPower usage = power x time \n\nTime = 3\n\nPower = 12\n\nThus, power and time are both used in this scenario. The usage is 12w.\n### Input: What about water conservation measures?", "answer": " 49"}

The phrase '___ hair' emphasizes the fact that the dog had a lot of hair, which contributed to his visibility on the run.\n2.'many' would be incomprehensible here because'many' refers to quantity and since quantity is not used in the sentence, it is irrelevant.\n3.'much' refers to the degree or intensity of a quality rather than quantity in the way that the man and the dog were both 'visible on the run' when they had hair.\n4.'much' is also a common word, which makes it quite easy to detect and therefore would be unlikely to be used. This is an instance of the'suspicious word' heuristic because we can easily distinguish these words due to how easily recognizable they are.\n5.

{"text": "lices of pizza at a time, whereas the average American eats what?\n    Choices:  A.8 slices B. 2.5 slices C. 2 dozen slices D. 1 pound of pizza E: A slice\n    Rationales: The answer to the original question is \"a slice\", not \"a\" slice. For instance, \"12 slices\" are not equivalent to \"1\" slice, so the question asked \"what\" and not \"how many\".\nThe question is asking about an average American, which is someone residing in the United States who does not belong to any particular social class or ethnic group, as opposed to Nellie, who can eat 12 times the average amount of pizza. This indicates that the \"average American\" should be compared with the amount that \"most Americans\" eat, and not the amount that they technically can eat.\nThe answer to the question is \"a slice\" of pizza, because this is what the \"most Americans\" eat. As \"an american\" is not a fixed numerical value, the question does not prescribe a \"per slice\" amount. The meaning of \"a slice\" here is the same as \"a piece or portion\", so 1 slice is equivalent to a slice for the \"most Americans\", but not for Nellie.\n\n### Input :Alice's hair is longer than Bob's hair, which does not show Bob's hair length.\nChoice:  A.

{"text": "grown up so he let it go for a run with Alice and Fiona. What is the correct name for a female golden retriever? Choices:  Lizzie, Tilly, Daisy, Dori, Mia \nRationales:1. Bert's golden retrievers are a female and a male. The context of \"his golden retriever(s)\" is to refer to the female golden retriever. Bert's male golden retriever does not need a name since it is already described as a male (the gender Bert mentioned explicitly).\n2. We also know that the female golden retrievers grow up and Bert lets them go for a run with his female dog, Alice.\n3. We can rule out \"Tilly\" and \"Fiona\" because Tilly and Fiona are not the dog's names. \n4. Now, let's look at the other remaining two. \"Daisy\", like the other dogs mentioned, is the name of a female, so it will be a suitable answer as well.\n5.

Choices: A: scooter B: skateboard C: bicycle D: bobblehead E: pogo stick\n\nInput:The car's engine failed to start, which system isn't working? Choices:  B: power A: water C: petrol D: electricity E: speed\nRationales: It's not just the engines that operate cars, but a collection of complex systems that work together to allow them to run.\nThere is no point on which a car's engine can simply fail to start. These problems typically indicate that other parts of the car aren't working.\nElectricity is also used to supply a car with power. It supplies power to the engine, lights, and in some models, even the wheels.\nThere are two main types of fuel that cars usually operate on: gasoline and diesel. Gasoline is also known as petrol.\nAll engines produce a measure of noise, so it can't be used as the identifier in this question.\nPetrol is used as the main source of power for most engines. The pump supplies fuel for the engine and allows it to start by providing it with a spark of energy. Pumping petrol into the engine creates a mixture of air and fuel, which can then be burned to power the engine.\nIf the car's engine fails to start, it means that it hasn't received petrol or another energy source. It's not likely that the power system is faulty if the engine can't start, and it's unlikely that the water system isn't working since that would render the rest of the car useless.\nThe car's engine is designed to produce a measure of noise. It can't be used since that wouldn't indicate a problem and would be expected.\nPetrol, the system which supplies the engine with fuel to power it, is the one that isn't working if the car does not start. Therefore, Option B: power is the correct answer.\nAnswer: B) power\n\nInput: The scientist wants to get rich off his idea, he will try to do what?

Choices: A: head B: ankle C: wrist D: face E: mouth F: chin G: leg H: hand J: knees K: ribs L: groin\nRationales:\n1. To begin, let's recall the events that preceded the question regarding the injured boy.\n2. He is playing tag and trips over a fallen tree branch.\n3. This implies that he would likely face an impact to his head, ankle, wrist, or face. The impact could also lead to him suffering injuries like a head injury, a sprained ankle, a wrist injury, or a bruise.\n4. Let us examine the provided answer choices. \n5. Choices 'A', 'B', and 'E' do not describe the injuries or body parts being injured. Therefore, they can be discarded. As for 'C', the wrist is too close to the hand for a pain to migrate between these two structures.\n6. Likewise, 'D' for the face and 'J' for the knees can also be excluded.\n7. Of all the other answer choices, 'H' and 'I' each describe injuries, however they are not relevant in the context of this question as they are not parts of the body.\n8. Next, we should consider 'G', 'K' and 'L'. The groin (\u2018L\u2019), knee (\u2018K\u2019) and ribs (\u2018G\u2019) are not likely to result in a bruised mouth. A collision with a part of a body (such as a bruised knee) is unlikely to bruise the mouth.\n9. Therefore, from the information presented in the question and reasoning above, we can say that it is most likely the injured boy banged his head on a fallen tree branch and bruised his mouth. The injured boy most likely banged his head on the fallen tree branch and bruises", "answer": " 21"}

Choices: \nA: freezing B: hot C: rainy D: cold E: freezing\nRationales: The sentence states \"if it happened to be up to me, which it isn't...\", indicating that the speaker is assuming a hypothetical condition that it is up to them. \nThis condition gives rise to several options that might appear in speech or writing: what would the weather conditions entail?\nConsider A: Freezing. While this option is correct, the sentence states that there is a difference between what it would be up to them and the actual hypothetical situation at hand. The speaker implies that the hypothetical condition would be for it to be up to them and that the actual condition happens to be cold but it's not something they'd control in the first place, hence B or C.\n\nConsider B: HOT. It appears to have temperature as an implied option, but it's not a valid option. The sentence states that \"the weather in question ISN'T hot\" and that the hypothetical is to show that it would be \"up to you\" if you wanted it to be cold, so that would mean \"it would be HOT\" or \"it would be cold\", but not \"it would be hot\".\n\nConsider C: RAINY. This isn't the answer either because it's actually the current scenario. A hypothetical is when one assumes a condition that is contrary to what is reality.\n\nConsider D: Cold.

It may seem that the answer should simply be 43(40+3). But that may not help us in this case because the problem says Maggie picked 40 and the problem says it again that she still picked 40. So the 40+3 shouldn't have any effect, so 3 apples should be deducted in the total, making the answer 37.\n-Rationale: the question is asking for the number of appples Maggie picked when she choose three of her favorite. The answer must be the difference between the number of apps she picked(40) and 3.

It is important to note that the options are not ordered in decreasing percent, and it is possible that choice A (50%) could be an option for the answer. However, this answer does not consider the number of pounds lost (from 180 to 150 = 30 pounds) and the resulting calculation for each percent (from 80% down to 40%). In this case, choice C provides the best answer, as it accurately represents the percentage of weight loss from Andy's initial weight of 180 pounds to his final weight of 150 pounds.\n\n### Input:[Name] bought a car to use at the beach, what type of car did she buy? Choices:  B: convertible  C: SUV  D: sedan  E: mini-truck\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what type of car [ name ] bought to use at the beach.\n2. We need to select a type of car that is a logical choice for use at the beach. SUV or convertible could be possible, but there is no particular information provided to support the reason why it would be used there.\n3. Hence, the answer must come from the remaining choices of D: sedan or E mini-truck, which are reasonable types of cars to use at the beach since they are comfortable for driving long distances and have large carrying capacity for beach-related activities like picnics or equipment.\n4. Option B: convertible is not an answer, as it does not mention beach use and also indicates a different location than", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "loose ends to tie up at home. Choices:  A. get lunch B. pack lunch C. make lunch D. eat lunch E. brush her teeth \nRationales:1. The woman has some loose ends to tie up before going to work. This means that she still has some household chores to finish before leaving for work the following day.\n2. She might make food, pack the food, eat the food, or brush her teeth while still at home.\n3. Answer choices (A) and (B) involve getting lunch or making lunch, but getting lunch is an activity that happens after going to work, while making lunch is an activity associated with preparation time, neither of which are appropriate for this question.\n4. Also, answering choice (C) would imply Jess made the lunch before getting to work, a statement that is false because she has still some \"loose ends\" to tie up.\n\t5. Answer choice (D) would imply that she has already gone to work. This is also false because the question statement describes her as still at home.\n6. Answer choice (E) is related to brushing her teeth which could be a response to some of her other loose ends. However, teeth brushing is not something commonly related to pre-work preparations.\n7. Therefore the correct choice is answer E, because this indicates that after tying up some of the loose ends, the woman brushes her teeth.\n\n### Rationale:\nInput:While making cookies, the woman had to turn on the oven, put the cookies in, and turn off the oven.

The woman cooks cookies by preparing the various components of the recipe in the correct order before cooking. The correct steps include turning on the oven, putting the cookies in the oven, and turning off the oven. So the choices related to turning on the oven (Choice A), putting the cookies in the tray (Choice B), turning off the oven (Choice C), and decorating the cookies (Choice D) are all steps in the correct order.

The Corolla does not have the best fuel mileage, but its gas mileage is more efficient than the average American car. So, why not look at the Corolla when you are looking for a low fuel car?\n  The engine is the mechanism inside your vehicle that transfers energy from the fuel you put into the gas tank and distributes it to the other parts of your vehicle. When you see that little red engine on the dash, it means the engine is performing its duty to send fuel to the internal combustion chambers at just the right times so the cylinders get fired, moving the pistons and making them roll on the cranksshaft. \n  The engine has a cylinder that houses the pistons and the crankshaft, which is the main axle of the car. The crankshaft transmits energy from the pistons to the wheels, which turn the car forward. The wheel is a wheel and has a hub and a tire.

{"text": "'s better to buy or rent at the moment, which would she be prefer to pay for if she knew her income would go up by 10%? \nRationales:\n1. A question with variables that have mathematical values will often require a calculation to determine the best choice.\n2. To figure out if it's better to rent or buy based on information about the income, let's consider the monthly costs of each:  \n**Renting:**\n- Rent cost $1,000 per month\n- Utility cost $50 per month\n3. When the income would increase by 10%, its new value is 110% of the current value, written as $N.\n**Buying:**\n- Principal cost $400,000\n- Interest cost $100,00\n- Taxes cost $35,000\n4. Let' rent >= buy, where >= means greater than or equal to.\n5. Given this constraint, let's choose the largest possible buy cost, which is $30,000 more than the rent cost. The calculations go as: \n **Buy > $1,00 <$1,300 + $50**\n6. The cost would then become $450,000 - $0.0130 - $35,063.85.  \n  - This total is greater than the rent cost, so buying outranks rent in this case.\n7. Thus, in this scenario, buying is preferred because its monthly cost is more than the rent - which also increases one by 10%, making the monthly rent now $1,100.\n\n8. Hence, choosing to rent would make Annie prefer to pay the money rather than to buy because it is most beneficial when income increases. \nAnswer: Buying\n \n### Input: What has the number three done for a dog?

{"text": "to watch  an old episode of their favorite movie that they saw ten years ago.\n\n### Rationale: 1. The text indicates that Rylee is bored. When you are bored, you need to do something else with your time. This most likely means watching a video or a show.\n2. The sentence also says that the movie is old,  which means it has been done or performed before.\n3. Choices A, B, and C could all be possible answers, but not D or E, because these statements don't necessarily fit together.\n4. Option D: Rylee's mind does not fit with their movie because boredom is a state of mind, whereas Rylee is watching a movie.\n5. Option E: Rylee' answer does not describe a movie. This sentence is specific that Rylee is watching the movie and not anything else, such as a show, music, an article, etc.\n6. Option A: Rylee' s friend could be watching a movie to escape boredom at the same time as Rylee, but this would not be the same movie. \n7. Option B: Rylee is also described as being bored. Again, people are not necessarily watching the same movie if they are both bored. \n8. Option C: Rylee' decision to watch this movie could have been made after finding the old movie on their phone. However, this could be a choice made by anyone and doesn't directly answer the question of what else is going on at the same time.\n9. So, of the choices provided, only A, B, and D don't fit together. Hence, this leaves A and B to choose from. \n10. But, these two answers do not describe the same movie. Rylee could have watched A while their friend watches B.\n11. The fact that D, E, and C do not fit together makes them incorrect, but all of the other options fit together.

{"text": "the ground make what?\n### Demonstraion:\nInput: When it rains, the holes in the ground make a ______. Choices:  A. river B. pond C. puddle D. lake E. fountain\nRationale: 1.The question is asking what happens when it rains and the ground has holes. \n2. Rainwater running off a surface into a hole in the ground can cause it to either become a river, puddle, pond, lake, or fountain depending on the size and depth of the holes.\n3. The hole can be shallow or deep, with a small area or large area of land, depending on the size and number of the holes.\n4. The deepest hole can potentially make a river if it has the ability to funnel large amounts of water down from the surface into a single outlet.\n5. A lake can also be made if the holes are deep enough to collect a significant volume of water, forming a pond or lake.\n6. A puddle forms when rainwater collects in shallow holes that cannot hold a large amount of water.\n7. A fountain may occur if water flows down from a high surface at an angle or height into a hole. It will only be a few feet high, however, and does not always form as a complete fountain.\n8. Hence the answer is D: lake. When it rains, holes can make a lake of water\nAnswer: D: lake\n\n### Input What do I need a calculator for if I want to buy a new cell phone and a new pen?\n### Demostration\nInput: If I want to buy a cell phone and a new ______, I will need a calculator.

Choices: \tA: summer B: when the sun is high because bears are most active at this time of the day C: when the sun is low because this can be a bit harder for a human to find a bear D: when the sun is rising or setting because this can make it easier for humans to spot a bear\n\nRationales: The question is asking which scenario is most likely for a human to find and hunt a bear.\nThe answer can be found by analyzing the phrase \"hunting bears\". As this implies the intent of pursuing or stalking the targeted object or animal, an effective way to discover a bear is by walking or tracking. Therefore, a bear hunter is most likely to find a live bear if the sun is either setting or rising. This is when most humans are traveling and easily seen by bears.\n\nWhile choosing time of day is important, choosing a season is not the most relevant way to find a bear. In fact, bears are most active near dawn or dusk when the sun is close to the horizon, so this can be considered too light for humans to see bears, which would make finding a bear difficult.\n\nFor the choice that says bears are most visible when the sun is high, most humans are not out during those hours. Therefore, it is not likely to find a bear when the sun is highest. In fact, beings would still most commonly be active at night, especially since it is not hunting season.\n\nWhen the sun is low", "answer": " 62"}

Flour could also be considered a fuel in cooking, but this might conflict with the context of the dish and the question.\n4. Sugar is also something that is typically used in the cooking process of pies, so this can be considered as an appropriate answer.\n5. Sugar is therefore removed before it can be used in cooking which could mean its ingredients are separated. Adding fuel would be a logical decision after this process.\n6.

{"text": "to pay for her phone, she then pays $4.00 to the store to use the phone call service, and she spends $0.50 for a snack. She takes home $7.00 from her purchase. What does Elizabeth do to get her snack? Choices: \t A: uses cash B: uses a phone credit card\nC: uses a credit card D: uses a debit card E: uses money from her account\nRationales:1. The first two transactions can be deduced by adding them together (3 + 4). This is because Elizabeth pays 3.00 to purchase the phone and then pays 4.00 to use the phone services. Hence, the cost should be 3.00 + 4.00 = 7.00.\n2. Her home price should still equal her purchase price: 7.00 = 3.00+4.00, meaning Elizabeth has spent all $3.00 and $4.00 of her initial purchase.\n3. The third part of the question is a little ambiguous. For simplicity, let's ignore credit and debit cards for now.\n4. The question asks about Elizabeth's snack. We know that she has $7.00 left and needs to pay $0.50, so she should have $6.50 left.\n5. If Elizabeth used cash or a phone credit card, her home price would decrease by $7.00. But if she used a credit or debit card, her home price wouldn't change.\n6. Hence, the most logical answer is C: use a credit card. This way, she doesn't bring home any cash, maintaining her snack budget.\n7. Therefore the correct answer is C: use credit card.\n\n## In the 2010s\n### Input: What might happen at the end of a bad football game?\n\n### Demand:  Choices:  A.

The question asks about the probability of at least three students having the same birthdays which can be obtained by comparing all birthdays to determine if a birthday is unique.\n2. Considering all the N students, each has a 365/N chance of having a unique birthday, the probability of at least one student not having a unique birthday becomes the complement of having a unique birthdate that is 364/(365*N) since there is only one way of not having a unique birth date.\n3. The number of ways of not having a uniquebirth date becomes: `(365/N - 1) * 364 / (365 * N) * 365 /(365-1) = 365 * (364/N)` which does not change the probability of having a unique birth date, only the number increases.\n4. For n = 20 this probability can be expressed as follows:\n\n`365 * (1 - 1 / 20) = 0.995 = 99.5%`\n\nMeaning that the probability of having at least 3 students with the same birth", "answer": " 6"}

B: painting a house\n3. C: fixing a motorcycle\n4. D: gardening\n5. E: learning to play an instrument\nRationales: An activity that takes the longest to complete is one that demands the longest amount of time. This means it takes the most time to do compared to other activities.\n1. Considering item A, playing chess requires a set amount of pieces and rules to follow in order to play. It's also a relatively complex game, especially when it comes to learning how to make moves or master certain strategies.\n\n2. Painting a house or room may involve lots of preparation, materials, brushes, tools, paint tubes, etc. However, once all the necessary prep work is done, it's generally only a matter of following the instructions for applying color to walls in order to complete this task.\n3. Fixing a motorcycle is less time consuming than either painting or learning how to play an instrument, considering one has to know about mechanical components or tools in order to do so (like wrenches).\n4. Gardening is an activity with an endless variety of possible garden designs and techniques, especially when it comes down to deciding what should be planted where and when.

If it is the latter, then we should be able to guess the man's identity because of the sentence: If you took a photo. That means there is someone who has a photo of the man, but you have no way of knowing that person. But maybe they would tell you who they saw in the photo. If it is flowers, then no one can possibly know what kind of flower is in the field.

In this question, we're trying to understand the qualities or abilities a person must have in their job in order to carry out various tasks.\n2. Let's analyze the choice options to help us identify the correct answer. \n3. Considering the context of 'job' we can eliminate Option A: talent/talents. A job cannot be done without talent, so this answer is incorrect.\n4. Option B: a sense for numbers and figures is also incorrect. A person needs knowledge to do their job well and the question only talks about a job in general.\n5. Option D: tools are often used in a job, however, a job can't function without someone having the skills and knowledge to carry out tasks.\n6. Therefore, since a person who is skilled at their job would not usually lack knowledge, the best choice is option C: knowledge. A dentist must have knowledge to do their job, regardless of whether they are using tools or not.\nAnswer: C: knowledge\n\nInput:The new software would take months to install but it had to work soon.

This option seems less than ideal as it could leave the client in a difficult position where they are still waiting for the software to be installed.\n5. Therefore, the client should delay the installation of this software by using option B \"Celebrate\". When it becomes fully installed, then, they can celebrate.\n6. However, we need to find out if the software is functional or not. This can be done by testing/reviewing the software with option E \"Test\". By testing, we can see if it works or not.\n7.

F. building supplies store. 7. G. paint maker. 8. H. paint store.\nRationales:\n1. A hardware store would be a possible source for painting supplies. This option could make sense for someone like Henrietta who is more mechanically inclined or familiar with working with tools and hardware.\n2. As for option B, a drugstore might also carry some painting supplies, like paints and brushes, though they are more likely to provide home supplies or over-the-counter medicines.\n3. Similarly, grocery stores could carry some paints and brush supplies, but they might be less specialized than other options like the hardware store and the painters supply shop.\n4. The option D, \"hardware aisle\" can be ruled out because it doesn't imply an entire location where paint supplies can be found.\n5. Option E, \"painters supply shop\", could be a potential answer as it implies a dedicated place to purchase paints and painting supplies.\n6. Option F, \"building supplies store\", could also be considered because a lumber yard is likely to provide paint. It is related to home renovations and has tools that could apply to paint.\n7. If Henrietta was a painter, she would be familiar with the option G, \"paint maker\". This makes sense as the paint store is one of the main places to find paint supplies. Option H, \"paint store\" could also be seen as a potential answer, but the phrasing of \"paint store\" is less direct in meaning, potentially implying just a location where you could purchase paints and brush-like tools, instead of a specific place to get actual paint and materials.\n8. The most logical option is answer choice C, \"grocery store\" as it specifically mentions the type of retailer: \"grocery store\".

Choices: A: long B: short C: medium D: short and small E: long and tall\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: The question asks about the length of an alligator named paul. The question states that it took Paul 7 years to complete a basket.\nRationales:\n1.  It's possible that alligators become larger as they age. This means that, if Paul had taken 7 years to complete the basket, then he may have been significantly older than a younger alligator.\n2. It also may be the case that alligators reach their largest size at a young age, so even if Paul was a very old alligator with a lot of experience making baskets, it would not necessarily make him taller than a young alligator.\n3. Therefore, to answer the question, we must first consider what we know about alligators and then decide based on their characteristics.\n4. Option A states that the alligator is long, which is not necessarily true.\n5. Option D states that the alligators are short and small, which is not accurate since they reach their peak adult height within the first 10 years of their lives.\n6. Option E states that the alligaters are long and tall, which is also not an accurate fit because the age distribution of alligators is evenly spread between younger and older adults.\n7.

Otherwise, \"so many people knew this\" would not be needed.\nTherefore, the correct interpretation is that \"this\" refers to that the game was going to start.\n\nThe sentence tries to describe two different situations. The first sentence talks about when \"you\" arrive early, and the second sentence talks about when people \"knew this already\".\n\nThese two situations cannot occur at the same time because you cannot arrive early and also know the game is starting at 8PM.\n\nIn other words, if it is already 8:00PM, then you already know the game is starting.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question in the sentence is D).\nAnswer: D: you already know the game starts at 8PM\n```", "answer": " 14400"}
{"text": "her headphones and playing video games while she does this.\n\n### What could one expect?\n\nInput: If you see a man on a bus, where would you more likely see him? Choices: \tA: seated B: standing C: leaning D: crowded E: empty\nRationales:1. The question asks about where you would be more likely to see a man on a crowded bus.\n2. If someone \"appears\" on a bus or any other location, it is generally assumed that they are present and have not recently left the location or been brought in.\n3. However, if they are appearing for a specific purpose or event, then the location they will be present in will also depend on that specific purpose or event.\n4. Let us analyze each choice in turn: Option A: The bus would be crowded when people are seated, which is not an uncommon scenario.\n5. Option D: The bus would be full and would appear at least somewhat crowded, though not necessarily \"crowded\" by everyone's definition.\n6. Now, let's look at the remaining choices: B: standing - It's possible that a person would be standing on the bus, but it's not as likely as when they are seated.\n7. C: leaning - Again, standing and leaning are possible activities on a bus, though it's not common.\n8. E: empty - This is the most unlikely scenario because a bus typically has a set timetable and a fixed number of available seats. When the seats are filled, people would likely be standing.\n9.

Ashley had a birthday and gave gifts to her friends. We are asked where most of the gifts were given.\n2. Gift giving happens in many places. The party could be in a basement or garage, where presents are unpacked and given to multiple people at the same time.\n3. Gifts can also be given by wrapping them up and hiding them around the house, especially in a child's bedroom.\n4. Presents can also be given in the backyard or under a tree.\n5. Lastly, we can consider gifts as typically being given indoors rather than outdoors.\n6. Option B: \"her tree\" is too specific. It would be unlikely that presents would all be given under one tree.\n7. Option C: \"in her garage\" mentions a potential place to give gifts, but multiple gifts could be wrapped and given to everyone at once, so this is not the only place where most of the gifs are given.\n8. Option D: \"in her backyard\" would likely describe one place where gifts are given, but it can't guarantee where most are given, since there could be other places where more were given.\n9. Option E: \"her yard\" could be a potential location where the presents are given, however, there may be other places where gifts are given.\n10. Only option A: \"under her tree\" is a definite answer. All of the presents are grouped together near a tree, so this would meet the criteria of where most of the presents were given.\n11.

{"text": ". When he's ready to cook the bread, where does he move? Choices: 2022/12/11: A: baking basket B: stove C: fire D: oven E: flame\nRationales:1. The question is about Jim's actions as he begins to cook the bread that he has baked.\n2. When baking bread, the dough needs to be heated and molded in an oven at high temperatures. In this process, it is helpful to use a baking kettle, which could refer to both a metal and/or a ceramic container used for making or boiling food. Since neither the stove nor the oven can be used interchangeably with the kettle, Option A: \"baking basket\" cannot be the answer.\n3. The question then seeks to determine the next step that Jim takes after putting bread in the container.\n4. Next up is \"fire\", which could be an answer for the next step during cooking, or after the bread is ready. Because the fire is used to cook things that have already been prepared, such as meat and vegetables, and because the bread has not been baked yet, it cannot be used to cook bread. Consequently, \"fire\" is not the correct answer.\n5. The same reasoning applies to Option C: \"flame\" where the flame is used to melt or heat something that is already created, which could be used to cook bread, but because the bread has not yet been baked, and because the \"flame\" is used only when the dough is almost ready to be cooked, \"flame\" is not the correct choice.\n6. Consideration needs to be given to the next option: \"stove\". The stove is used to heat cooking pots, either by using fire or other means, which could refer to the kettle. Therefore, \"stove\" could be in contention as the answer. However, we need to consider if the next step, after putting bread in the kettle, would be putting it on the stove.\n7. Since bread is not intended to be cooked on a stove, because stoves are primarily used to make other things such as cakes, pancakes, etc, \"stock\" is not the answer.\n8. Therefore, Option", "answer": " 2"}

The question asks about an individual situation where they realize they are out of sugar while planning to eat a lot of fruits. This implies that this is not the usual way the individual eats fruits.\n2. The answer is D: \"get more sugar.\" An unusual event like having no sugar while preparing to eat many fruits would most likely lead to an individual seeking out more sugar or another appropriate sweetener to combine with their fruit.\n3.

{"text": "in his orchard. Every week he makes how many deliveries?\nInput: It costs $50 for 1 apple how much does apple juice from that cost? Choices: \n1. $38 2. $15 3. $0.10 4. $5 5. $230 6. $7\nRationales:\n\n1. The question asks how much apple juice from $50 dollars' worth of apples will cost.\n\n2. Answer 2: $15. The question states $50 dollars which corresponds to 1 apple. The question also asks how much juice from it will be, which equates to 1.735 litres of juice. However, if you have 60 mangoes in your orchard, how much juice from $5 dollars' worth of them would give you approximately 37.75 litres. But if you had $500 dollars' worth of $20 apples, you would have 25 L of apple sauce. This can be further reduced to get a good price for a gallon of puree that can turn into a pint-full of juice easily or a half pint of jam. This gives us an easy conversion of $200 to $50 and $10 to $0.10.\n3. Answer 1: $38. We don't know the exact number of apples because if it were exactly 1 apple, then answer two would be 100% accurate.\n4. Answer 3: $0.10 If there are 100 apples, then they cost $50. If you are using smaller apples, the number of apples you need to pay for $50 might be 250 apples, in which case, the answer is $0.10 per apple.\n5. Answer 5: $230 To make it more specific to the task, we can assume that there is only one apple per gallon, and therefore, 60 apples at $50 will cost $660.00 to make gallons of juice. Since each apple contains about 216 ml of pure juice, the price per ml is $3.15. If you were to make a half liter of pure", "answer": " 85"}
{"text": "whom? Choices: 1. A: the boss and her employees 2. B: the worker and her boss 3. C: the company and its investors 4. D: the boss and the company 5. E: the worker and the boss\nRationales1. The question describes the profit from a business transaction, which is usually shared among the involved parties.\n2. Let's consider the answer choices. Answer 1 involves the boss and her employed workers, but the transactions that produce the profit do not typically include employees.\n3. Answer 2 includes the worker and boss, which is a more likely option given other information in the question.\n4. Answer 3 is a bit of a stretch- the profit in business transactions mostly comes from increased sales volume or efficiency.\n5. Answer 4 mentions the boss and the business but not the other two options, suggesting that those are not applicable to the scenario.\n6. Lastly, Answer 5 includes the worker and the bachelor, which is also possible, but it is not explicitly stated in the question that the profit was shared among these people.\n7. Thus, the answer for this question is Answer 2: The boss and the worker.

The question asks about a tax deduction that can be taken if one lives in their home for five years.\n2. A property tax typically refers to a direct payment by the owner of a property to the government, which is separate from any salary received for owning and maintaining the property.\n3. While the tax payment itself could be considered a deduction from income earned, the phrase 'total mortgage' suggests that the deduction is for something else.\n4. The phrase 'total net worth' could be used by people to describe the value of their personal property after liabilities like debt or taxes have been considered.", "answer": " 800"}
{"text": ". What did she do later? Choices: \nA: sell them B: buy more C: spend the whole day D: pay them with credit E: mail them\nRationales:\n1. The question asks what Bella did after she bought stamps.\n2. There are several possible answers: selling, buying more, spending the whole day, mailing, or paying with credit.\n3. Consider the first option given: \"A: selling them\". Selling stamps is generally not something one does after having already purchased them. It is much more likely that Bella would have already purchased stamps and then later sell them to someone else, or not sell them at all. \n4. The second answer given is \"B: buy more\", which is somewhat correct but not fully accurate. If Bella had purchased stamps before, it would be unlikely that she would buy more the same day unless she had run out.\n5. Another incorrect answer given is \"C: spending the whole day\", which is not related to the actions Bella performs after purchasing the stamps.\n6. Another option given is \"D: mail them with credit\" which is the opposite question asked. The question already states that Bella went to the post office to buy stamps, so it doesn' t make sense to say that she mails them somewhere else.\n7.

They all earned a total of $114 together, so they have a total of $156 combined.\n\n3. The first piece of information is that Lisa earned two times as more than the amount earned by both Jack and Tommy.\n\n4. We begin by trying to solve for Tommy\u2019s income. Since Tommy earned $111 less than Lisa, Tommy made $33.\n\n5. We multiply that by two then subtract it from the 114 that everyone earned.\n\n6. Multiplying 33 x two = 66\n\n7. Adding it to what Jack and Tommy earned =$114\n\n8. Since one of Tomoy\u2019s and Lisa\u2019s income is 66 and his is 69, we multiply 66 by one and add it to the other.\n\n9. $66 +69 = $135.\n\n10.

{"text": ", each one had a different color. What could you do with those pencils? Choices: A: use for 50th birthday party B: put back on shelf C: take out of each box D: write on them what they are E: return to box\nRationales:1. The question is asked about the actions that could be taken in regards to ten boxes of pencil, each one containing a different color. \n2. For this activity, there are many possible options, as the possibilities for the usage of a box of pencils are nearly endless, such as using them for school, work, or hobbies.\n3. The choices given are: put back on the shelf, take out of each box, write on them, return to box, \n4. It can be said that putting back a box does not include writing on it, nor does it require taking out each box of pencils, thus options 'put back on shelf' and 'take out of each box' can be rejected.\n5. Writing on the pencil boxes means using each box of pencil to write on.\n6. Hence, choices 'write on them' and'return to box' cannot be chosen.\n7. So, that leaves 'use for 50th-birthday party' and 'put a 'what are your' on them'. \n8. The activity of whatsapp means adding details or information to a post or message, so 'put a 'what' on them' makes no sense.\n9. For the birthday party, this could refer to writing individual birthday notes, or adding pencils to a 50th birthy day party gift idea list, or just keeping pencils around as a reminder.\n10.

{"text": "ball together? Choice A: Yes B: No C: Who knows D: Yes, and they play soccer too\nOutput: Jerry has two daughters. They play softball together. One plays volleyball. Who knows what other things they play?\nRationales:\n1. The context indicates that there are two options to answer this question: \"yes\", \"no\", \"who knows\", or \"yes, and they play soccet too\".\n2. After analyzing the choice \"yes\", it isn't the most appropriate answer because it's very likely that Jerry's two daughters play more than just softball.\n3. Similarly, although the answer \"no\" seems simple enough, it's not clear if Jerry's daughters play softball, and this option lacks substantiation.\n4. With option \"d who knows\", there may be some truth to it as Jerry might have more than two daughters in his family, which may be playing different sports too.\n5. But this choice does not have evidence or a logical argument to back it up.\n6. The question itself also lacks a clear yes or no response. Thus, we have answer choice \"Yes and they play soccot too\".\n7. The response \"yes\", as given, is logical as Jerry's two daughters might play softball or other sports.\n8. But we also learn that it isn't just softball that is played by them.\nAnswer: \"Yes, and they play soco too.\"\n\n### Input 2:A woman has two sons her sister\u2019s husband, who both play football, where her husband plays baseball.

Choices: 0  B: $9  C: $11  D: $13  E: $15  F: $19 G: $22 H: $24 I: $28\nRationales:1. Based on the information provided, it can be said that James and Sally earn approximately $19 per hour when they work side by side.\n2. It can be inferred that the same job is available for both of them, because if the two job offers were of different kinds then their pay wouldn't necessarily be comparable.\n3. James earns $20 per hour and Sally earns $28 per hour.\n4. Let S be the hour that James and Sally work together in the department store.\n5. Then, when James and Sally combine their earnings at $20 and $28 respectively, this is roughly equivalent to S \u00d7 (20 + 28) = S \u00d7 48 = S \u00d7 (48/28) = S \u2192 2 x 48 = 96 \u2248 $96 per hour.\n6.

The question then defines the 'apples vs' scenarios as follows: \" In a non apples vs scenario, a player plays a series of games with two different rules\". The'series of games' defines the 'rules' of the games and hence the'series of games' that defines a 'ruleset' and that is why the first answer is 'apples vs applet'. The second answer is 'apples' because the first answer's definition states it as 'apples vs applets'. The third answer is 'oranges', since it is the 'non-apples' to 'apples' scenario and 'game rules' can be compared like 'apples vs appli'. For example, if the rules of red and blue apples were different it", "answer": " 840"}

{"text": "pet fish and a large spider is hanging out in the tank as she adds water.\n### Rationales:\n1. The sentence describes a situation where Nancy is filling an aquarium with water for her pet fish, while a large spider is also present.\n2. The next part of the task describes various ways in which Nancy could go about dealing with the issue of the large spider hanging out in her aquarium.\n3. Let us analyze each choice:\nOption A: Nancy can get the plant as a gift and put it in her aquarium. This is possible, but there is a potential risk that Nancy may be allergic to the plant.\nOption B: Nancy can buy a net to trap the spider. This could help, but there is a risk that the net itself might injure the fish, who could get hooked or have its fins torn by the structure's hook points or by other sharp materials within it.\nOption C: Nancy can put a glass over the spider and let it die. This could possibly work, but it would likely require a lot of patience since the glass needs to remain in place for a long time, and it may be difficult to ensure that the glass will not break.\nOption D: Nancy can place a leaf in the aquarium so her pet fish can eat it. This is a possible solution, though there is a problem if Nancy is allergic to the leaf and her reaction may harm the pet fish, who would likely be curious to eat something in their environment and may not know that the item is harmful.\nOption E: Nancy can wait until the other fish eat him. This is a possibility but there is a chance that one of the other fish will die and the spider will not be consumed.\n4. This leaves Nancy with Option C: placing a glass over the spiders to kill him. This could potentially help, but it requires a lot of patience, as the glass needs to remain over the spider for a long time, as well as enough precision to ensure that the glass does not break.\n5. The only risk of using a glass cover is that the spider may not be properly trapped or might escape and cause further harm to Nancy's pet fish.\n6. So in conclusion, Nancy should be cautious when using a glass cover on the aquarium.\n\nAnswer: A: \"Nancy can get the plant as gift", "answer": " 54"}

The question refers to Hans's decision to book a room in a hotel. The hotel must be one with specific characteristics that distinguish it from other hotels.\n2. The options represent various features or types of hotels, and it is important to identify the specific hotel Hans booked a room in.\n3. The options are a mixture of characteristics and features of hotels. So, we must carefully consider each choice to make an informed decision.\n4. Option A, \"the cheapest\", may not describe the hotel in which Hans booked a room. Perhaps Hans could have chosen the cheapest option given to them, but it's not clear if this is what happened.\n5. Option D, \"serving more food\", could be another distinguishing factor for hotels, but this may not apply to Hans's decision. If Hans is choosing a room with a view of the ocean, they may not care so much about having a view of the food being served in the hotel.\n6. Option E, \"closer to the beach\", is more relevant, but this is not necessarily a defining characteristic for Hans's chosen hotel. Hans may have booked a room based on other factors, which may not necessarily include proximity to a beach.\n7. Option C, \"is the largest\", is not applicable, as this is not particularly relevant to Hans's choice of hotel. Large hotels may be able to accommodate many guests, but Hans may not want such a crowded space.\n8. We can narrow down the options even more by combining them with \"not\". The remaining options are: the hotel with a view of the beach, the hotel with the most rooms, and the hotel with the best food.\n9. Option B, \"is the most rooms\", may not be relevant for Hans's hotel choice. Perhaps there were other factors that played more of a role in choosing the location, and not just the number of rooms.\n10. Option E, \"serving more types of food\", also does not describe Hans's chosen hotel because they could have chosen this option as well.

So, 86 of a type of pet is the answer that has to be less than the best-selling pet, and in this case, it's option D: other.\n6. 86 of a pet is sold in a store, so it must be different from the best-selling one, which makes option D the answer.\n7.

The statue has been stored in a warehouse until it can be sold. C. She has made the statue many times. D. She has only made one and stored it in her studio. E. There is a man in the room.\nRenaleses:1. The question contains the term \"statue\" which is a figurine, image, or representation of a person, animal, or scene carved in stone or made out of metal, wood, etc.\n2. The \"studio\" is the location where wax sculptures are crafted, stored, and displayed.\n3. Answer Option A: The statue is made from Beeswax- The question asks whose \"statue\" being \"made\" but doesn't mention the material or type (of statue) being made. Beeswax could be one option because it is used to create sculptures. However, this doesn't give any information about the statue being housed in Loraine's studio.\n4. Answer Option B: The Statue has been stored in a Warehouse Until it can be sold - We assume from the context of the sentence that a \"statue\" has been made by some person or organization but now that the person/organization can make a profit from selling them, they are storing them in a warehouse. This tells us that the statue is made of wood, steel, metal, wax, clay, plastic, fabric, cloth, etc. because a variety of materials can be used to create a statue.\n5. Answer Option C: She has made the Statue many times - This tells us that a \"statue being made\" is a repeated occurrence, meaning not just once. However, it doesn't explicitly tell us that this statue is being kept in Loraine' sister's studio.\n6. Answer Option D: She has only made one statue and then stored it in her studio - This is the correct answer.\n7. She has not stated that several statues were made but only one was subsequently stored in her studio. This also tells us that there is only one statue in the studio and not many.

Derek can buy 2 cakes of one type with his total amount of $960.\n\n**Answer for Choice: 1)** Given that Derek has $300 to buy large cakes and $960 to buys two of them. According to the equation (300 dollars = large cakes /2), he needs to buy $450 worth of large cakes.\n\n**Analysis:** Derek can buy 1 large cake and 1 small cakes if he can buy more large and less small. The amount of dollars he needs to have to buy 1 large and 1 small is $450 = (450+$960) \u00f7 2 = $300. For $300, he can buy $960\u00f7 300 cakes (one large cakes) \u00f7 (2 large and 1small cakes) = 3 cakes. So for $300, 3 large cakes can be bought. From the question, we know that each type of cakes is available at different price.

If we take one $20 bill from Oliver's money and add it to the total, the answer will be 16 + 1 = 17. \n5. The correct answer, however, is 17 $1.

Choice: K: after the friends had left\nRationales:\n1. The question is about when the friends drank the seven bottles of water. \n2. There are options for when the friends bought and drank the water, and for when it was produced.\n3. Let us analyze the purchase and drinking options, one by one. Austin buys the friends a water bottle during two separate times, a) the beginning of the expedition, (option E: \"when the friends bought the bottles of water\"), and b) after the expedition when they go to the park to take a rest, (option G: \"when the friends had rested\").\n4. Let'll analyze drinking time.\n5. The answer should be when the bottle has enough water. It may be drank in different ways, like drinking it from the bottle or using the beer mug. Austin's beer is drinkable and comes with a mug, so drinking beer in the mug is a possibility.\n6. Hence, the answer should be when the water is drinkable.\n7. The drinking options include: F: \"the friends drink the water after buying\", but that's incorrect because they don't buy water, only the bottle. Also, the friends have not finished the bottles of water yet, so they are not drinkable, and thus not a part of the choices.\n8. Hence this option is not possible.\n9.

E.The people that left posts to attend to riots were not-helpers where people leaving their posts were helping.\nRationales: Choices A, B, and C: Each of these choices are very similar and state essentially the same thing. After reviewing each choice, they all could be summarized as: \"The people that weren't helping were not helping, and the people that were, they were leaving their posts to help in the riot.\" There is no support for the help given.\nD: There is a discrepancy in the text describing that some people in the riot left their posts and were not helping and others were helping.

Option A: There are two methods that can be used to determine how many books Stu has more than Albert.\n2. If Stu has 9 books, and Albert has 1 book. Then Stu has 8 books more than Albert. So Stu has 9 -1 = 8 more books than Albert.\n3. If Stu has 24 books, and Albert has also 24 books. Stu has the same number of books than Albert. But if Stu has 9 books Albert has only 12 books, so therefore Stu has 9 books more than Albert. Stu has 24 -12 = 12 books more than Albert.\n4. If Stu has 4 books, and Albert also has 4 books, Stu has the same number as books as Albert. If Stu has 1 book, and Albert has 3 books, Stu has 1 book more than Albert. So if Stu has 1 book Albert has 2 more books than Stu. Stu has 1 -2 = -1 more book than Albert.\n5. The answer options presented are not correct. Stu has 2 books more than Albert if Stu has 9 more books than Albert. Otherwise Stu has the same number.\n6.

In order to remember where she puts her shots and avoid forgetting any, it is best for Holly to keep them in a designated place.\n3. Let us analyze the multiple choice answers in turn- A) \"pill container\" isn't the best option as that is an object where medications, not insulin shots, are stored. B) \"safe\" is a possible option as a safe is essentially an object that is locked or secured for the purpose of storing items or valuables.

Next, let's look at D) \"purse\"- this is very similar to option C). Both choices represent places that are most commonly used for storing items, especially of a personal nature.\n5.

This may lead to faster running or may not. This is because the bear may train even harder to counter the effects of staying awake, and this means they will not be able to run faster.

Reggie is outdoors because he is in the gym hallway, a common area that would be referred to as an outdoor court. If that was the case, the basketball would not be used where? On the answer choice of an indoor court. This hints us at that the answer may be the outdoor court instead. Answer: outdoor court\n\n### Question2\nAnswer:\nThere are three choices: not shooting for the championship, not shooting for fun, and not being able to shoot. Reggie is out in the \"hallway\", not in the gym, so that eliminates not shooting for the championship.

If item was $150, meaning that it is only sold for $150 this week. Therefore, 150-150=0 and 250-250=0. If it were sold for $111 the amount would be $25-111=111-25-11-111:0 (which would never occur), meaning there would be no change in price. If it were sold at a discount of $50 the original price would be $150-$50=$100. If it were a decrease of $50 it would be $155-50=105-25-105:0 (same result), meaning that there would be no change.

Buying more food than necessary is not necessarily a mistake unless it's a waste of resources. \n7. Choice B: buying more dog food than Elise realizes she needs seems like it could lead to a mistake. If she has extra food sitting around, it might spoil and go to waste.\n8. Choice C: buying dog food for the large dog but not for the small dog could be a mistake.

As he finishes the last paving task of the day, James notices that he still has time before his project is completed.\n# Demonstration\n1. The question presents a scenario where a person is paving a parking lot. The job typically takes many days to finish, and requires a lot of effort and attention to detail. When the job is nearing completion, James notices he still has time before the project is finished.\n2. At this point, James could either choose to stop working, or continue onto a final, more tedious step which ensures the project is complete. However, if he chooses to do this, he runs the risk of having to do the entire job over again.\n3. Thus, James must weigh up the benefits and drawbacks of finishing the final task, in order to decide if he should proceed or not.\n4. Answer D: continue completing the project is the correct answer because it encompasses the context of the question. Continuing the project is a risk if the final task must be repeated because even if the paved parking lot is completed, the task may have to be started over again because it is incomplete.\n5. However, if James chooses to finish the extra task, he increases the likelihood of a finished parking lot. Continued effort and time is necessary because of the tedious nature of the job, it being difficult to complete one section quickly.\n6.

Choices: 46 inches Aman's height B34 inches Aman's dad's height C29 inches Rodney's height D24 inches Rodney's dad'a height E36 inches Rodney's mom's width\nRationales:1. The question asks, given the information that Rodney has 35 more dollars than Aman, how tall their mom could be.\n2. To answer this question, we need to use the relationships between the numbers of money, people, or things to derive their corresponding values.\n3. When dealing with relationships, it is critical to keep track of all values, both given and derived, to have a complete picture.\n4. First, we can assume that Aman is Rodney's sister based on the information that their mom is twice of their dad's height.\n5. From here, let's consider the variables \"money, people or things\" in the provided information and \"their heights\", which would be the variable derived.\n6. In the case where Rodney has 3 dollars more than Aman, that means Rodney is 3xAman's height. Rodney is Rodney's own height.\n7. Thus, Rodney's height is Rodney's height x Rodney's height.\n8. The term \"height\" can be interpreted as either the height of someone or something's body or how tall someone or something is.\n9. Therefore, this equation will have one unknown of \"Aman's height\", since Rodney is also the same height as Aman.\n10. Next, we need to solve the equation for Aman's height:\n9. Thus, Aman's height is 46 inches.\n10. As Aman is Rodney the sister \"3 times\" Rodney'e age, which is also the same as Rodney's own age.\n11.

{"text": "How many years ago was Zhang twice as old as Li?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nIn math, ages are relative to each other, and you use the same basic formula to figure them out:\n\n\\(X-Y \\approx T\\)\n\nThis means you subtract or divide one age by the other and get an approximation of how many years they differ.\n\nIn algebra, X is the original or base age and Y is the desired answer, so you're trying to get the base age subtracted from the answer age.\n\nThis formula doesn't necessarily work because of the word 'approximate', but it often helps to show the magnitude as opposed to the absolute value of the difference.\n\nLet's work backwards. (Let\u2019s think of Zhang\u2019s age as B) How can we be twice older when our age is B?\n\nThe answer will probably come as no surprise as we saw earlier that Zhang is twice as old than Li.\n\nThe simplest way to calculate this is to do the opposite, we divide X from the answer. We get X \u00f7Y, to show that it is the base age X that is being divided from the desired answer Y.\n\nSo it would look like this:\n\n\\(2(B)-Y \u2248  X \u00f7Y\\)\n\nTo solve it, the first thing to do is cross multiply and get the answer, this means:\n\n\\(Y(2B)-X \u2248 I\\)\n\nTo get an answer from this, we need to isolate the variable that comes from the right side. This is done by combining and dividing by two. To simplify the operation, we can cancel the one on the base age, which leaves us with:\n\n\\((2B -Y ) \u00f72\\approx B \u00f72\\)\n\nThe final answer comes when we isolate the number we are trying to find. The number we are trying to divide by two is B, which leaves:\n\n\\((B-Y) \u00f72 \\approx X \u00f7Y\\)", "answer": " 26"}

{"text": "warren, how many total rabbits would there be?\n### Demonstraion:\nInput: If seven more rabbits are  added to the warren.  Rabbits would be  total.  How many rabbits? \n\n### Reason:\nInput: In this question, the \"warren\" is the space that is occupied by the rabbits.\n\nInput: This adds the total number of rabbits.  This also cancels the \"warrens\" as they do not count the rabbits.\nInput: Total rabbits.  Since the warren will have seven more rabbits, the question is  about how many rabbits are there in total (not just in this warren). \nRabbit, which refers to the animal, has been used repeatedly and in context of \"rabbits\" in the question.\nThe seven other rabbits include the original rabbit. \n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe question doesn't specify the kind of warren or how many rabbits are presently present in that warren.  If seven more rabbits were added to that first warren (if that is a kind of warren) with seven rabbits, there would be fourteen rabbits. If seven more rabbits would be added to a warren that has only eight rabbits, there would only be twenty five rabbits. If seven rabbits added to a warren with six thousand rabbits, the warren would have six thousand and seven rabbits.\n\nAnswer: There would be twenty five rabbits after seven more rabbits areadded to the first warren with seven rabbits or eight rabbits are added to a warren containing eight rabbits.  If the \"total\" is defined to be fourteen rabbits or twenty six rabbits respectively, both those answers to the question are correct. Both answers are also logically consistent with the context of the problem.\n\n\n### Rationales\n\nInput: Seven more rabbits are added in the warren.  It shows that warren is already occupied by rabbits.  If you add seven more rabbits to the original warren, how many rabbit\nthere would be now? Ans: There are ten rabbits at the original warren.

This could be 1,2,3..... or 4.\n\n### What's the answer?\nThe question asks for the difference between the number of books Ziger wrote more than Zag, but also asks Zag wrote how many books when put together with Zig?\n\nLet take for example, you want to buy eggs, but the store only sells 6 eggs.\n1. First choice, you buy 6 eggs. = 1\n\n2. Second choice, you buy 8 eggs and 1 egg you bought from another day = 3\n\n3. Third choice, you buy nothing = 0\n4. Fourth choice, you buy 9 eggs = 4\n\n5. Fifth option, you buy 10 eggs and 1 egg from the other day you bought = 5\n\n6. Sixth option, you buy a million egg (not including the egg from the other day) = 4\n\n7. Seventh option, you buy nothing and eat egg from the previous day = 3\n8. Last choice, you buy nothing and no eggs from the previous day =2\n\nHence the answer is seven.\n\nAnswer: E: $0$, 8 eggs\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The phrase \"Zig wrote four times ____ as many books as Zag\" includes a number in which \"___\" denotes number of books. Hence, that means \"Zig wrote __ as many books as Zag\", and \"___\" can't be \"0\", it has to be any number.\n2. Since Zag wrote __ as many books than Zig, now we have \"______ books\" on one side and \"Zig wrote __ books\" on the other hand. Zag wrote __ books as compared to Zig's books. Subtract \"Zig wrote __ \" from \"____", "answer": " 75"}

{"text": "how much will it sell for if each inch of height is worth 8 cents? Choices:A: 56 cents B: 88 cents C: 0 cents D: 560 cents E: 400 cents\nRationales:1. The question is about a box whose height is 8 inches. From this information, we can calculate the height in feet and then multiply by the price per inch.\n2. Consider B:88 cents, which is not an answer.\n3. If the height of the box was 1 foot, it would sell for 88 cents.\n4. However, we know that the box is 8 inches, which converts to 2 feet and 4 inches.\n5. Therefore, the box would sell for $4.\n6. Answer C: 0 cants would never be the value of the box as the value will not be 0 or negative as a whole.\n7. And from the box is 88 cents, and A:56 cents is not an answer as we have subtracted two values which were used to calculate 56 cents.\n8. D:560 cents which means that we will multiply the height in the previous exercise, the inch which was 8 x $8 to give us $64.\n9. Again, from the previous exercises which were calculated in $0.16 then dividing to get 8 to give us an output of $40.\n10. Therefore, we get 88 cents as the output which was our answer earlier.\n11.

{"text": "bowl of food. And the dog eats one cup. What quantity does his dog drink? Choice A: 1 Cup B: 1 Quart C: 2 quarts D: 1 Gallon E: none of these choices are correct.\nRationales:1. The question presents a situation involving Harris and his dog. Harris feeds his dog 5 bowls of food, and each bowl is an eighth full. The dog eats 3 bowls.\n2. Then it asks how much 3 cups are. Since the answer is not given, it is likely in order to determine his dog's daily intake.\n3. Since each bowl is 1/8 full of food, a cup is 8/8 of a bowl (a whole bowl). So 3 cups are the same as 3 bowls. And 3 bowls are the same as 75% full.\n4. The dog eats one cup of food total. So it is 1/18 of the food Harris already fed to the dog, indicating a 50% reduction of food (this makes the dog's food go twice as far).\n5. A cup of water, on the other hand, is 1/16 full. So the dog drinks twice as much water as it eats (and eats food). 60% of food (50%) + 100% water (100%) = 150%, leaving Harris to ask what was the quantity in total\n6. Option A: 1 Cup.

{"text": "She wants to keep her money in a bank, where might she put it? Choices: \tA: retirement savings B: checking account C: short term savings D: long term savings E: tax free savings account\nRationales:\t1. There can be multiple ways to keep money in a bank, but the question specifies \u201cwhere might she put it\u201d implying that she wants to store her full $600 in the bank. She could deposit the money into one or multiple different account types, but will be selecting the best overall choice for her purposes.\n\n2. Options A: \u201cretirement savings\u201d and D: \"long term savings\" are the most similar concepts in terms of duration. Retirement savings generally refers to funds set aside during employment to finance the cost of living expenses in retirement, which typically has a long term horizon.\n\nHowever, they are different because retirement savings is an account type, whereas long term savings is specific to its money purpose. Retirement savings can include multiple account types as part of a larger fund, while long term savings is an umbrella category for multiple distinct accounts. As an example, a retirement savings fund may include both long term and short term savings accounts.\n\nAlso, the question does not mention \u201cretirement savings\u201d, so the choice A: \u201cretirement saving\u201d is removed as an option.\n\n3. Options C: \u201cshort term savings\u201d and B: \u201cchecking account\u201d are both account types. Like retirement savings, short term savings can be included as an account in a larger retirement savings fund. They are also different from each other because short term savings is an account purpose (i.e. money goal) whereas checking account is an account type.\n\nAlthough both \u201cshort term savings\u201c and \u201cchecking account\u201d can be used as a bank account, they are each distinctly different in terms of purpose. \u201cShort term savings\u201d is an account type meant to accumulate funds in short term, which will be used soon in the near future. \u201cChecking accounts\u201d are regular bank accounts designed for day-to-day spending, withdraws and payments.

This is not a correct answer.\n*  The sun is large.  This is also not correct because it doesn't really explain why the sun is large, whereas the answer does.\n*  The Sun Has A Higher-Surface Temperature.  This is correct because this explains why the diameter of the sun is so much larger than that of earth (the sun's a large sphere that has a high-surface temperature, thus it's much warmer, and the earth's temperature is considerably cooler because it doesn't rotate, allowing it to be smaller).\n*  The Sun has a Low Surface Temperature.

To do this, Robi Ney pours some water from pichers. \nRationales:1. The question asks to describe the volume of a \"15 gallon water box\" in terms of linear inequation.\n2. To find the volume of the box, we need to define the volume of a water pitcher to a linear inequation. \n3. For a water pitcher, the volume can be calculated with the following equation: \n```\nV = \u03c0R 2 (Equation 1)\n```\nwhere `V` is the volume of a pitcher in inches cubed, and `R`, in this case, is the area of pitcher's cross-section, which is half of the radius squared. \n```\n  -15 = \u03a0R\u00b2 \nR\u00b2 = 15 \nR\u00b2 = (15)/(15)\u00b2 \n  R = 2\n  V = \u03a0 2 49 \n  V = \u03c0249\n```\nSubstituting the above equations, \n```\n  V = 76.9 \ud835\udf0b \nV = V * \ud835\udf0b\nV =76.9 * \ud835\udf03\n  V = 6832.465298097 (rounded to 6832 \ud835\udf0b).\n```", "answer": " 24"}

The question is stating that Jimmy bought [3] pens for school, but it is unclear whether he bought 3 [pens] for school. If 3[pens] were meant, then the question would start with 'He bought 3'. If pencils were meant, the question would start with the word 'He is'. It is unlikely that the question is meant to say that Jimmy is buying his school 3 pens. We need to look for which of the options could be meant here.\n2. Since, Jimmy bought 3 pens, it's a possibility that it's a sign. Also since, he is buying his school, he is doing it as an activity or an act.\n3. So, 4 of the options start with A: dedication, B: procrastinate, D: work ethic, E: organization. We have to eliminate A, B and E because Jimmy could be procrastinating or lazy while making this purchase, however it is an act or an activity and not laziness or procrastination\n4. Among B: dedication and D: work ethic we need to see which can be meant as an activity or an action.\n5. Dedication could mean Jimmy would be dedicated to his work.

Thus, the predator is also 8 times fitter.\n\n### Input If she got a job as a waitress, she would get to...?

{"text": "els today as she did last week\nInput:What is Angie looking at? Choices:  a tablet device  a smartphone a laptop a clock an iMac\nRationales: The phrase \"three times as many\" implies that Angie bought three more pretzels than she did last week; there is no mention of what she is holding or with which device she is watching. This means that she could be comparing the numbers on the pretzels she bought today to the numbers on the pretzel she bought last week, which would require a table to do so. Alternatively, she could be comparing today's purchase with the purchase of a set of pretzels on a different day, and this would require a calculator.

Choices: A: sleeping  B: studying  C: waiting on food  D: watching sports  E: sitting\nRationales:Because Jamie is going back to \"his\" apartment, he would be either coming from the bathroom (to avoid waking neighbors), or going to his apartment from one of his dining tables that were inside (as it is unlikely he would be coming inside from just going to the bathroom, and would be coming home from a night of drinks/hanging out at the bar). \nTo explain. This means that Jamie could be heading either into his apartment from going to the bathroom or vice versa, and both of these actions would require him to leave the bar at 'this time.' So we have a choice here.\n\nBecause his apartment is in the bar, that means it's only available to guests during certain hours (think of how hotels work) and Jamie can choose to either check-out from the bar, or back to his apartment, this would require him to leave 'this time.'\n\nSo to sum it up.

This creates a temporary arrangement as opposed to the long-term one offered through leasing.\n Answer: The main difference between a leasing agreement and a rental agreement is that leasing is typically a long-term agreement where the person who occupies a property is renting it exclusively with ownership remaining with the person owning the property.\n\n Input:What is another word for the process of making a website in html?\nRationales\uff1a\n HTML\n Answer:\n\n### Input\n\nWhen preparing a new diet to follow or to learn a new skill, when do you begin?

Tim gets 6 hours of sleeps 2 to 4 time per day but he just has one dream that's his recurring dream so he doesn't try to wake up every time he falls asleep.\n2. The answer choices given by the author are 6, 18, 560, 1365, and 4032.0, which are all a large group of different numbers (1000 - 1500).\n3. We need to find the number of times the amount of sleep time he can see each new dream for his first time. Since we know that each time he only sees one. So we can get the times to see each new dream from the amount of sleep time. \n4. Example: If he sleeps in 6 hours then we will try to get 6 times of the amount of time and it can be (720, 864, 1728, 3176, 5344) from the group of different numbers.\n5. This means that each new dream can be watched the first time with at least (6 x 720) amount of time.\n6. Next, if we take 6 times of the (6 x 750) amount will be 6 times of (3900) which is already more than the first time to watch a new dream (18 times of 210 or 3620).\n7. Now if we take 6 more times of the (6 times of 3900) amount, we can get 6 times of (2340) which is (1365 times of 21) which is already more (1365 x 45) than the first time to see new dreams (18 times of the 21)\n8.

From choice A, Andy will be ten years old and the question asks about his age in the future after five years have passed. \n3. Option B describes when Andy will have ten years of professional experience, which in this case is irrelevant to the question. \n4.

E: 35 an ant eggs\nRationales:1. Let's first answer choices C: 70 Ants and 10 eggs. First off, it's extremely unlikely there are 70 ants, given there are only 50 ants in the jar to start with. Additionally, if we assume that the ant eggs survive long enough to hatch (which is unlikely, given the conditions that could be present in an environment like this) there would be an additional 10 ants.\n2.

{"text": "many sets. Which set would allow the participant to gain more points? Choices: \nA: easy set B: average set C: hard set D: medium set E: difficult set  Rationales: 1: The question asks which set would allow the participator to gain the most points. 2: Points are commonly tied to questions which get answered correctly, but this question requires consideration for the level of difficulty of the questions being provided by the contest. \n3: By sorting the sets according to their difficulty, we can then determine which will allow the participant to earn the most points.\n4: Consider choice A: \"easy set\". This set will allow the participator to solve problems by choosing the correct answer out of the available choices presented. If all solutions are correct, the participator will receive the maximum number of points.\n5: For choice B: \"average set\", we find that it contains an assortment of questions, some which could score full points for correct answers and others which could deduct points for incorrect ones. This combination of possible points and scoring criteria can make it difficult for the participator to achieve a maximized score.\n6: Similarly, choice C:\"hard set\" may also present problems when it comes to answering questions correctly and gaining full points. This is because it contains an assortiment of questions that offer limited chances to obtain all possible points while simultaneously presenting chances for point deductions.\n7: Therefore, we must focus on choices D and E. Choice D: \"medium set\" contains a combination of question options that can either offer full points or take away points. This means that the participator could potentially lose points in some instances but also gain them in others. While this option could allow for some chances at earning plenty of points, it also carries higher risks of losing some and would not be guaranteed to provide the maximum points attainable without further information about potential scoring systems or difficulty levels associated with individual participants' responses \n8: Choice E: \"difficult set\" has slightly different scoring options than the previous choice. If all presented questions are answered correctly (without deductions) the participator will get the maximum possible number of points. However, if any questions are answered incorrectly, they will automatically get deducted by a certain amount of points based on the difficulty level of the question, with the most significant deductions given to harder problems.\n9:", "answer": " 38"}

Choice A (which reads 4m2) is one such choice as its value implies it is either a very small or very large number, which would not be a valid result. Similarly, Choices B and C (reading 3.84 M2 and 6 m 2 respectively) fall outside of this range, and Choice E (reading 5.2 M2) is a little too small (having a value of 5 m 2 ). \n 5: As Choices B, C, and E are eliminated for the reasons above, Choices D and E are the only remaining answers.

{"text": "the most spiders in one minute with what? Choices: A: teeth B: lips C: stomach D: pants E: nose\nRationales:   1. The phrase \"world record\" suggests that the question refers to a specific set of criteria within which the answer can generally fall.\n2. The goal of the task is to determine the body part that Kevin uses to consume numerous spiders in the shortest amount of time.\n3. Looking through the given answer choices, none of A, B, C, or D are suitable except E: nose.\n4. Nose, being the \"nose\" of the world record holder, is a fitting answer. This allows the spiders to be consumed without swallowing, preserving the record-holder status.\n5. According to a 2016 article, Kevin Liu, a 14-year-old boy, holds the record for eating 167 spiders in one minute by placing them \"under his tongue and biting off the heads, then discarding the bodies.\" His record does not utilize any type of technology or assistive devices. With the use of his nose and tongue, he was able to set the world record. Therefore, the final answer is E: nose.\nAnswer: E, nose.\n\n### Input:`What's a better way to have your eyes adjust to dark than by wearing glasses?'

A: Cash B: Plastic C: Check D: Money Order E: Gift Voucher\nRationales:1. Paying in full is a concept where one pays the full amount or total price upfront for a service or product before it is provided.\n2. This concept is typically used to avoid paying later or at a later date.\n3. For a travel reservation, paying in full ensures that one gets to confirm the reserved seats or accommodation and avoids any concerns about payment.\n4. Each of the answer options has its own context or usage.\n5. Let's explore each of them and see if it's suitable for use in a case involving payment in full:\n6. A: Cash is typically used for transactions involving immediate payments for goods or services.\n7. B: Plastic refers to the use of credit cards or online payment methods, which can often be used for payment in full depending on the service or product provided.\n8. C: Checks are typically used for transactions involving more significant amounts of money or value, which may or may not include paying in full.\n9. D: Money order payments are typically used for payments that involve specific values and denominations and usually do not involve paying in full. \n10. Lastly, E: Gift voucher, is a type of discount voucher that is not used for payment in full but rather it would instead be used for reducing the total cost of the service or product after a payment was already made.\n11.

Option B:  salad- is not relevant, because the question says to order desserts, pizza, and a salad.\n7.

Choices:  (A) cell phone (B) radio (C) fishing pole (D) bottle of water (E) watch\nRationales:The situation describes someone being stranded on a remote desert island, far from any other inhabited areas as well as infrastructure like cell phone towers. Since there would be no way to contact anyone else, a cell phone is completely useless. That leaves choices (B), (C), (D) and (E). Let's go through each one and see if we can determine what's necessary for survival.\nOption (B) - Radio. A radio might or might not be useful depending on how it's used, but either way it's not something necessary for survival. Option (C) - Fishing Pole. A fishing pole can help with fishing but it can't feed a person alone. Option (D) - Bottle of Water. A bottle of water is a much better option than nothing but water alone isn't enough to survive for long on a desert island. Option (E) - Watch. A watch isn't a bad survival tool but it doesn't specifically help with anything the way a bottle of water does. Astronauts can use their watches to tell the time and monitor their heart rate, but we can't say with assurance that all the time the person is on the island that the watch would be functional.

Mr. Sam's $2000 is 100 dollars greater than half of the $1,00 he had.\n7. Mr. Sam'ss $2000 was $400 greater than any boy's money.\n8.Mr. Sam shared $2000 with every other boy.\n9. Mr. Sam has $2000 for each boy so is 1000 % of Mr. Sam'ss own amount.\n10. Mr. Sam does not have any of his money so he has $1000 - Mr. Sam's share. This amount is the rest of Mr. Sam'samount.\n11.Mr. Sam'ss share was greater than 1/2 of the rest of his money.\n12. So, the boys get $200 more than the rest of money.\n13. Then, the boys get $300 more than the amount each boy got.\n14. So, the amount each got was $300 more or $400.", "answer": " 5250"}
{"text": ". How would you tell her the tea needs cooling? Choices: \tA: to add ice to the blender B: to get the coffee pot C: to get a spoon D: cooling to the ice for the party E: the tea would like a little cooling\nRationales:1. To make tea, Artemis is using a blender. If she adds ice to the blender, she will cool the tea down in the blender to a cold temperature.\n2. A coffee pot is an appliance used primarily for brewing coffee. While it is possible to make tea with this, it would not necessarily cool down the tea.\n3. A spoon is an item used for eating. It is not a tool for a party or to cool tea.\n4. The tea would like a little bit of cooling is ambiguous. This could mean she would like to cool the tea down, or want to make it a little cooler, or she wants a little tea with cooling in it. The answer C: to get the coffee doesn't make any sense. \n5. This leaves us with answer choices A, D, and E, but choice A gives the best answer.\n6. An ice blender is designed to make ice. And to make iced tea, the tea would generally need to be cooled down to keep from overheating. So iced tea is often made in ice blenders because they can quickly chill it to the point where it is at the right temperature to serve.\n7. So the answer to the question Artemis is making tea that needs cooling?

{"text": "ats and 5 guinea pigs, how many pets is Ed most likely to have if counting? Choices:  B: all 5 animals C: 16 animals D: all the animals and none of the animals E: 17 animals\nRationales:1. Ed has 2 dogs, so we have 18 animals, not 17.\n2. It is important to note that the question asks for the largest amount that Ed is likely to have, which is likely to be the greatest amount.\n3. When it comes to animals, each of the animals can live in groups or communities. Guinea pigs usually live in groups of 3-5 animals. Dogs generally have mating pairs. Cats are usually solitary but a few breeds can be found in groups. \n4. Ed cannot have more pets than he can count. Ed is likely to only have enough animals to count; animals like guinea pigs live in groups so even if you have one guinea pig, a group of three guinea pigs is called a covey.\n5. So, if Ed is trying to count the total amount of pets he has, he will likely be able to count them all. But, if Ed is wondering what the biggest number possible is, the largest number he is likely to have is the greatest number of animals he has.\n6. Ed has 7 different animals, so he is most likely to have at least 7 animals. 7 is the maximum number of animals Ed is likely to have.\n7. Ed cannot have all 5 animals, because there are two dogs and 3 cats. You can only have as many animals as each particular animal can live. So, Ed will have the maximum number possible, which is 7.\n\n### Input : What is the most likely animal for Sam to have in his yard? Choices: A: goats B: turtles C: snakes D: cats E: owls\nRationales:\n1. Goats are social and live in herds. A goat is not likely to live by itself.\n2. Turtles live individually. They don\u2019t usually live in groups.\n3. Snakes usually live in groups, but it doesn\u2019t mean that they always do. Some snakes, like boa constrictors, live with each other but not in groups", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": ", but is concerned that she is holding her knives dull instead of sharp which means she is not likely to make an accurate throw. How can she ensure that the sharp end of the knife will be facing out of the hand she is throwing it with? Choices: 1. A: make sure she is grasping them with the right hand 2. B: make sure she is using one hand to throw if possible 3. C: sharpen one side of each knife before using them 4. D: use scissors instead of knives 5. E: make sure the knife's blade is flat.\n\n#### Rationales: 1: Option 'A', \"make sure she is grasping the knives with the right hand\" in incorrect because the question asks about how Jeanette can ensure that the sharp end is facing outward. Grasping the knife with the right hand will have no effect on whether the sharp or dull side faces outward; rather it depends on how the knife is held at its tip.\n\n2. Option 'B', \"use one hand to throw the knife\" is incorrect because the question talks about how to ensure that the sharp end faces outward, which means two hands are better for throwing balance and force.\n\n3. Option 'C', \"sharpening one side of each knifefor use\" is incorrect because it does not guarantee that the sharp side will face outward, and it is unnecessary if there is concern about cutting oneself; sharpening knives would be for use in cutting.\n\n4. Option 'D', \"use scissors instead of a knife\" is incorrect for similar reasons as above, and there may not be any knives available for use.\n\n5. Option 'E' is incorrect because a flat blade may feel slighter dull than it should be, and this may not indicate that the knife is actually dull or sharp.\n\n#### Rationale: The answer is A: Jeanette should make sure she is grasp it with the right hand because when you hold the knife with the dull side against the palm of your hand, the dull side of the blade will be facing out.\n\n### Input - The man is trying to decide between buying a $1200 suit or a $600 suit.

{"text": ", and likes 1/3 of them more than any other, which means he likes 5 of them most, which are all in the same color. What are those 5 cars?\n### Rationales:\n\nThe question asks what 5 of 16 cars Bobby likes most. The question is not about how many cars Bobby likes in total, but how many he prefers from the remainder. As per the rational, \"1/3 of them\" means that out of all the toy cars he collects, he prefers 5 of them.\n\nOut of 16 total cars, he likes 5 and prefers 5. He likes 5 with \"their tops on\", which can be implied by the use of adjective \"more\", whereas he prefers 5 with \"the top off\", implying they are empty car shells. Both \"Bobby's\" and \"any other\" mean the other preferred car, which is 5th in number out of all he owns. This can be implied by 5/16 or 25% of those he owns.\n\nLast, Bobby likes 5 of 10 blue cars.\n\nFollowing is an explanation:\n\nGiven:\n\n1. 5/16 = \\text{0.25}\n\n\\text{i.e. 5 of 15. (0.25*15 = 3)}\n\n2. {0.25} of 16 cars he owns are most preferred, which are 5.\n\n\\text{or 5/16 of those he owns belong to (0.25)}\n\n3.

This means that the numbers of cars Bobby's color is \\frac{3}{8}.\n\n4. 5 out of the 16 toy car Bobby owns belong to blue.\n\nAnswer: The question is about what color 5 toy cars Bobby most likes.

But, when you read the question carefully, there is no specific instruction that mice must be animals that can't be put in the box.

{"text": "aked them in what to give them an oven like texture? Choices: \nA: oven B: cookie sheet C: hot water D: dry heat E: oven mitts\nRationales:1. This question is asking about a way to give cookies an \"oven-like\" texture by baking them. 2. In baking, the heat of the oven produces the \"oven-like\" brown and crispy texture that is typical of baked goods, such as cookies and bread. 3. Ann's question hints at this. She wants to use alternative techniques to achieve the same results as baking using an oven.4. The choices given are oven, cookie sheet, hot water, dry heat, and oven mitts. 5. Oven is the obvious choice for an oven texture. However, hot water and dry heat do not produce the \"oven-like texture\", so exclude them. 6. Oven mitts would be useful handling the hot oven, but they are not a necessary requirement to bake cookies.7. Cookie sheet is only an option if the texture was desired, but it is not required to make the texture. Hence, there is no need to bake cookies on a cookie sheet.

It's asking how many days it would take to use 75 plates (10 times the number 7).\n2. The first option is B. Option B doesn't address how long it would take for Tom to use all 75 weight plats. It would state the day he starts using them and that's the only day option B would apply to. Option B wouldn't apply to when he'd use the last plate.\n3. Choice C doesn't state how long it would take to use the 75 weight plast. Also, I doubt Tom uses 5 weight plates daily for one day.

My sister is 20/45 of my actual age.\n\nIn this case, their ages must be twice each other, if not more or less. Additionally, if one is 20 times as tall as another person and the other person knows their age, the height can be expressed as a fraction that is half their age.\n\nFor example, my friend is twice as tall as me, and he is 18. Therefore, his height is 18/2 of my height(6 feet), equalling approximately(since my height is not known) 6/2.  6/2 = 3(because the number comes out to a rounded down(but exact) number, so divide in your head and the answer will be 6/2= 3.\n\nThen, to get Anne's height, divide Susan's height(which is known and not", "answer": " 200"}

Sunday: the Sunday prior of the Monday. Tuesday: the Tuesday prior of the Monday. Wednesday: the Wednesday prior of the Monday Thursday: the Thursday prior of the Monday\n\n### Rationale: First we need to understand our constraints:\n1. We know five members didn't work on the project for each day we are checking against in the given days on Monday through Wednesday. This is because Monday has three members working, Tuesday has four members working on it, Wednesday has three members working on it, and Thursday has four members working. It's guaranteed Thursday will have four.\n2. Therefore, all the days we check against are guaranteed to be Monday through Wednesday and all of the days on those three days are guaranteed to be Sunday,", "answer": " 3"}

The mother told Phillip to \"go to the store to get [milk]\", so Phillip must go to the store, not the other way around.\n5. c.Mother: Back: this choice is incorrect because Phillip is not asked to return to his mother (which would be \"front\").\n6. d.Mother: Front: this is a possibility, but Phillip might not have actually gone inside the store (it's possible he left the milk out front of the store or bought milk at the drive-through).

Let's assume C: 3: Let's assume that it was a number of sweets on the table so that the sweets could be taken by more than one person, and hence we need to add all the sweets taken by each person to get the total number of sweets taken by everyone. We assume that Jack is just one person out of others so he couldn't have the entire table.\n2. The sweets are presumed to have been on the table so it's more likely that 2 or 3 persons were there. Let's consider each option.\n3. Option A: 1: Jack could have had just one sweet. If there were 6 sweets on the table, it would be reasonable to give 1 to Jack and 5 to persons not present. \n4. Option B: 3: We need to add all the number of sweets taken and hence Jack taking 3 sweets make sense with the assumption that we are talking about the sweets on the table and not the entire stash. Moreover if there were 6 sweests, this is the most probable options.\n5. Option D: 5: If every person had 1 sweet each then the remaining 6 sweets would be distributed among 5 people. If there were 7 sweets on the table then Jack might have taken 5 sweets and someone else could have taken 2.\n6. Option E: 7: If the person who had the smallest number was given 7 sweets and hence others could have 1 if 7 were on the table.\n7.

In some cases, you will have to make a choice from a group of two or more answers. Whenever the options are in a group, choose the answer that best answers the question.

The context of the question is about a situation where Roselyn gives Mara a certain amount of money.\n2. We want to choose the third party for which Roselyn's son provides three times the amount given to Mara.\n3. The possibilities given in the question are Mara's son, husband, brother, grandfather, and Roselyn herself. This implies that each person could potentially be the correct response.\n4. A: Mara's is the father of her child, not necessarily involved in providing her money, and is not the person to whom Roselyn is giving any money. Therefore, we can eliminate this option.\n5. An argument in favor of B: Mara's Husband is that Mara's husband is directly related to Roselyn as they are married. He could potentially have some role in giving her funds or helping her to receive them. However, we know that the money is coming from Roselyn and is not the husband's money.\n6. The brother is one more degree removed from the situation, again not involved in giving Mara funds.\n7. Mara's grand- father is not necessarily going to have any relationship with Roselyn, as he is at least two generations removed in age and thus could likely be outside of the family.

{"text": "atuity even though the customers did not receive any food or service from the restaurant.\n\n### Solution:\nThe restaurant should not charge gratuity.\n\n### Input and Rationale:\nA shady restaurant is not just charging money to customers; it is also claiming that the customers received food and service. For that to happen, the customers would need to consume, or consume any parts of, the food provided by the restaurant. If they didn\u2019t consume the food, how could they claim that it was eaten through accidental food poisoning? Also, there must be proof that customers got service. This can\u2019t be achieved through accidental food poisonings.\n\n### Rationale and Input:\nHonestly, this is a difficult question to answer because the question could also be about customers who didn\u2019t get served or were given substandard food or service. So it\u2019s hard to tell which service or food the customer actually consumed or used at the restaurant, so the restaurant must\u2019ve assumed that the customer ate the whole food. So that\u2019s why it feels like a scam, but on the other hand, no one gets served at a restaurant or gets any service without paying; it makes sense to ask for a gratuity after a customer gets served. So it can be considered a scam if the customer ate something and then paid gratuity or maybe if the restaurants didn\u2019t provide any services for which they asked for a gratuity. \n\n### Input & Rationale: The correct choice is B.\n\n### Choice 1\n\nNot eating the food could be any type of food poisoning, including accidental food poisoning. It doesn\u2019t matter if the person ate the whole thing or not. And if I wasn\u2019t at all served by the restaurant or got any services done, I would feel robbed since I would\u2019ve never been served by them at any time. So either way I felt like I was robbed due to them offering nothing. \n\n## Rationale:\n\nThe restaurant is still charging a person for something they didn\u2019t do. Someone must\u2019ve eaten it to order to get food poisoning, and no one is allowed to take money if there is no contract of agreement; the restaurant is still charging someone for food or services that no one received. \n\n##", "answer": " 41"}

The question refers to a wedding, which is a social, ceremonial occasion when two people are married or united in marriage.\n2. It is typically an event that involves a number of financial expenses such as fees for ceremony venues, decor items, photos/video sessions, catering services, etc. \n3. So, Laura's goal to \"keep [her] wedding low cost\" means that she will strive to minimize her expenses in order to spend less money overall. \n4. The various options in the question refer to different descriptions or levels associated with costs. The main thing to determine is whether the option relates to how much or how little Laura is willing to spend on  her wedding.\n5. An option like \"free\" is clearly not a cost for a wedding as it is completely free.\n6. Another option like \"cheap\" refers to a lower price point in the context of products, services, or items offered as a comparison to what they are typically sold for.\n7. However, this does not align with the question's context as Laura is not necessarily looking for cheap/inexpensive items per se. \n8. \"Costly\" is also not an accurate answer as the question is asking how much Laura is willing to spend, not whether her expenses are comparatively costly in terms of how much something would normally cost.\n9. Next, let's go through the remaining answer options.\n10. The next choice is \"expensive\" which refers to the amount paid to purchase a product or receive a service from someone.\n11. However, this is not the best choice as it does not match the question's context, which indicates that Laura is trying to minimize expenses overall and not necessarily spend as much as possible.\n12. After eliminating, choice A: expensive and B: Expensive as possible, the only option left is C: Costly, as it specifically refers to the costs associated with a wedding, which Laura is planning to keep low.

{"text": "occer game, a player who hasn't played much in a long time, or who makes fewer goal attempts, could accumulate many points in how many minutes? Choices: 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 120 150 204 509 188 5085\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about the number of minutes required for a player not used often in a long time or who makes fewer goal attempt in a 90-mind game to accumulate many points.\n2. We know this player is not used often in a 90 minute soccer game, and hence may not contribute heavily during the time. Based on that, we can eliminate options such as 150 & 204.\n3. Next, let's analyze the options from 0.5 to 3.\n4. Option 0.5 is out - a player won't contribute as much as 25% from the start of the game - we know they're not used for quite long, it's just not expected they contribute well at the start.\n5. Option 1 is out - a player who contributes well at the start of the game probably doesn't need 90 minutes (the duration of one game) to get many points.\n6. There's too much time between 1 and 2, so they can be ruled out.\n7. Option 3 is out - again, the player is supposed to not play much, so it's not expected that they will score many points even if they play till the end.\n8. Option 2.5 is very close to 2 - the player is not used for a very long time, they shouldn't contribute heavily towards the end, there's not much time difference between both. 2 is eliminated, too.\n9. Only options 1 and 2 remain. But neither fit the question completely, both of these require a player to make more goal attempts then they actually do. 1 is the closest we can get, but it doesn't fit at all. We can conclude that the minimum minutes required are either 1 or 2 - we know a player making few goal attempts will take at least 150 minutes (2.5 times 60, the time 1 game is", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "What was he attempting to carry oranges in? Choices:  B: backpack C: suitcase D: purse E: trash can\nRationales:1. Seth bought some bags of oranges and may be trying to carry them.\n2. However, the question asks about what he was attempting to carry the oranges in, so we are not considering whether he successfully carried them or not.\n3. The options are a backpack, a suitcase, a purse, and a trash can.\n4. Though the trash can may look like a container from a distance, it is not likely what Seth would be attempting to use to carry the oranges.\n5. The suitcase is a container to travel with, not carry things in.\n6. Though the purse and the backpack will hold things, they are not specifically designed to carry large amounts of oranges.\n7. This means the answer can be narrowed down to the backpack and the suitcase.\n8. Next, let's consider the cases where each is used for carrying items.\n9. The backpack may be used for short commutes or overnight trips to work in a remote location, as well as outdoor activities like camping.\n10. The suitcase is generally used for longer periods and for carrying much heavier gear than the backpack. It is often used on longer trips like vacations.\n11. Thus, the suitcase is the better option as it is a suitable choice for the type of journey Seth is on and the heavier oranges he is carrying.\n12.

The jar is full of marbles, and he doesn't know what kind of pattern they have, so he asks his friend to find one without a pattern. \n2. His friend needs to start the task. \n3. The task is to find one without a specified pattern. \n4. Here are some patterns, let's analyze each of them and eliminate ones that they won't use as pattern and choose the right one.  \n\n#### Marble pattern\nMarble pattern: a pattern that mimics a marble, usually with regular sized circles and smaller circles or lines.\n\nE: No, marble pattern doesn't fit because marble pattern has smaller circles or lines. In this situation, they have to start with a bigger pattern not smaller ones.\n\n5. Hence E: Marble does not fit our criteria, so we can eliminate this answer. \n6.

{"text": "tall fir tree. What might he want to do afterward? Choices:  What does Keaton do after climbing the 30 feet tall tree?\n\nA: enjoy B: jump C: descend D: relax E: get up\nRationales:\n1. Keaton probably climbs a 30 feet tree because it offers the opportunity to see new things and experience different perspectives.\n2. After climbing a tree, Keaton likely wants to do more than just enjoy sitting at the top of the tree.\n3. To relax, one can sit on the bottom of the tree or on the nearby ground. However, this does not suggest that climbing down is a preferred option.\n4. On the other hand jumping off or down the tree could be exciting.\n5. To descend, one can find an already-climbed down tree and climb down from there.\n6. Or, one can choose to jump down or climb down, but this does not always have to be a preferred option.\n7. Based on these reasons, C: descend and C: jump are the most appropriate choices, as they are not mutually exclusive.\n8.\n\nChoices:  What is the type of tree that Keaton climbs?\n\nA: tall B: old C: slim D: narrow E: wide\nRationales: One can climb all types of trees, but one would want to climb a specific tree for their intended goal, such as to see new things and have different views.\n\n1. The type of tree that would be best suited to the task of climbing is D: narrow in width. Wide trees have a large surface area that a person must spread their feet on, which could make it difficult to climb or balance. \n2. Narrow trees are likely to have branches growing closer together, which makes it easier for a person to find support when climbing. These narrow trees are also less likely to break than wider trees, making them more stable. Additionally, they can provide a better vantage point for seeing new things and experiencing different perspectives. \n3. As a result, tall, old, slim, and other types of trees may also be appropriate for climbing, but narrow trees provide the best option for the task of climbing.\nAnswer: D\n\n###\n\n###", "answer": " 11880"}

{"text": "A clear sale has what as opposed to a vague sale? Choices:  G: a certain amount of discount B: a certain price on items C: certain merchandise for sale D: time limit \nRationales: Here are all the possible answers 1. A clear sale generally implies that a certain amount of discounrts will be applied to specific items.\n2. A vague sale, on the other hand, will not give a clear price for specific items and may involve sale items across an entire store that are not limited to discounted items but rather anything at a cheap price. \n3. Certain merchandise for a sale, in this context, refers to items that have a specific price without any discount applied.\n4. D: a time limit on the sale is not relevant to this context and has been ruled out as an answer choice. \n5. There's a clear overlap between A and B, where the sale items are discounted from a specific price. However, B provides a clear amount of a discount for sale items. In this way, option B better answers the question, and we can rule out A as a potential answer. \n6. Option C refers to \"certain items\" in a sale. Any other items that are not discounted or on sale would not count as \"certain\". In this way, C could actually be both relevant and an answer to the question. \n7.

According to this concept, kids who like to read will develop a high level of literacy. While this theory is intuitive and appealing, there is limited research to support it - something that frustrates many literacy advocates.\n\nThis is because there has been no good way to measure the importance of reading for recreational purposes in a young reader's life. Too many variables such as time, place, and book make it difficult to tease apart the influence of reading for fun on reading ability.\n\n### Input:\"When I Was a Child, I Read A Lot and I Was Well Versed in Literature, Now I Do Not Read.\" Choices: A: This statement is false B: This statement is true C: This statement is irrelevant D: This statment is a question E: This statement does not appear in the passage\n### Rational:Answer: A: This statement does not make sense. The author clearly states the importance of reading for literacy improvement and yet states why they are failing to do so. This indicates that they probably still do, in fact, read. \"This sentence does not make any sense\" (a negative response) appears better than \"A: This statment is false\" (which just says it is not true).\n\n### Conclusion:In this reading comprehension task, choice B: \"I have become less interested in reading\" had the highest possibility of being the right answer, with choices A and C close behind as reasonable choices. However, both of those choices are true statements about reading. The author states that they read a lot. The statement simply switches the reading habits to other categories without suggesting that those habits do not include reading.

C: Why didn't the brand simply hire a different person to write these posts? D: Has the brand figured out how to make the posts? E: How come the brand hired the account manager to create the content, when it seems they should just hire a creative content writer to do it for them since they don't want to be repetitive?\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. The question is about a social media account manager who must create unique content for his client's social media posts.\n2. The problem is that the post for which he is writing the content has not seen anything similar before, so he must try to think of something that hasn't been said before.\n3. For answer choices A: Why didn'y he just write \"the word\"?: One reason the social media content creator might not want to simply write \"the words\" is that they want to be original.\n4. For answer choice B: How is it he didn't say? Because the brand had asked for original and unique content.\n5. For answer choice C: Why didn'ty the brand simply hire another person to write these posts?: If the company finds that their content is repetitive, they will probably look for a better writer more skilled in creating original content. This is because they may have discovered that their current content is not good enough.\n6. For answer choice D: How come the brand didn't use a different writer to create the content: Because they will want a specialist in this area. They might find that someone not so skilled in their field would not produce high quality content.\n7. For answer choice E: How come the brands are using an account manager. Since they don't want their content to be repeated : This may be a question the reader will have. The brand chose an account manager rather than a writer because the account manager may be more skilled in this area.\n8. The best", "answer": " 2"}

Choices: A: school B: park C: street D: house E: tree\nRationales: The phrase \"the house is located near the\" indicates that the house is situated next to or close to the lake. \n\n### The word \"located\" suggests that something is purposefully placed in a specific area or position.\n\n### As for \"the lake\" part, lakes can either be natural occurrences (like a lake on a farmer's land, for example) or artificially made (such as man-made lakes).\n\n### Looking at choice A: school, the word \"school\" does not necessarily indicate a lake so eliminating this option.\n\n### Choice B: \"park\" could potentially be a possible option, but this option does not indicate whether the park is natural or artificial to the narrative.\n\n### Hence, this leaves us with choice C: \"street\".\n\n### \"Street\" refers to paved roads that are commonly used as a mode of transportation for vehicles and pedestrians.\n\n### Since the house is located on a street, this indicates that the house is likely quite close to water as streets frequently intersect near bodies of water like ponds or lakes.\n\n### Thus, the answer is C: street.

{"text": ", what had its start on the side of a mountain? Choices: \n> A mountain B rock C a bear D fire E ground\n### Demonstraion:\n1 A mountain. A camp is a temporary settlement for outdoor recreation, often located in a distant place from the comfort of one's home. Mountains can be remote or relatively easily accessible due to their elevation.\n2. Rock C. A camp can mean a place to sleep and cook, a shelter from the elements, and a place to live as a seasonal residence. In this case, we are talking about a place to sleep and eat where the ground is an unsettled place to put up a tent.\n3. A bear D. A fire isn't specific to a mountain but rather a camp and an area where camping is taking place. \n4. Fire E. There are not any locations where fire starts. \n5. Therefore we need to determine whether the answer is ground or rock. \n6 Rock. We can rule out grass with answer A because grass is a flat piece of ground. Likewise, the answer cannot be ground because Greg's family was camping at the side of a mountain and the sides of mountains are almost never made of flat ground.\n7 Rather the mountain's side is often uneven and rocky, and it's likely that the rock is what originally existed at the side of the mountain. \n8 Therefore, the answer is Rock.

Since Marcy is electing her leader, she must be in a grade - a group of students who have the same teacher and study the same subject.\n2. A student is not always a leader. There are many kinds of leaders: the leader of a sports team, the captain of a ship, the conductor of an orchestra, and the President of a country to name a few. While all of these examples are students, they don't all elect their leader.\n3. Mr. Wilson may be the principal of the school Marcy attends or a teacher in a particular grade. He may have been elected to be a leader and may be the leader currently but Marcy's grade is not yet electing their leader from those who already exist in their grade.

The school is a large organization of many grades, each having their own teacher. Mr. Wilson is just a teacher in Marcy's grade so that doesn't make him the leader of Marcy's grade.\n5.

This rules out D: Both alone as they might choose to do this with other people as well.  2) A: Both together should only be chosen if they are choosing to use their own hands together, for example they are jumping in synchrony (ie Roberto does it exactly when Valerie does it).

Choice C: valerie might choose to use her hands instead of taking turns if she is more skillful than Roberto.  \n\n2) The question states that they are jumping rope TOGETHER, so it would not be reasonable for Roberto and Valerie to be jumping together while taking different beats to jump.

Let's define \"water\" in this context. One might think of water produced in the processes: \nextruding PET, melting PVC, and plastic.\n\nWe can rule out the process of 'injection molding' because it requires no water.

Options that seem plausible include getting a new car, mobile phone, family, dog, vacation, second house, or new computer.\n\nOption E ('his new car')is incorrect because the man does not own the car yet. Thus, this option is impossible to use next year.\n\nOptions F ('his cell phone')and I ('a vacation')are also incorrect because the man does currently \nhave his mobile phone.

Let' s analyse each valid choice. \n* B: The choice \"The blues era\" is a category that includes \"The Great Depression\" and \"The World War II Era\", but it is still a parent category of \"the 1950's\". Hence, there is no scope for the radio to be from 1990.\n* C: Motown is part of the \"the 1960's and 1970's eras\". \"The 1960s and 1980s\" covers Motown as a specific category, and there is no scope for Motown to precede Motown-era. \"The 1990 era/the late 1990\" is a category itself, and there is no room for Tish to buy the radio before that era.\n* D: This choice refers to the \"the 1090's era\", and since that is the same as the main category for all other choices, this choice doesn't help much.\n4. So, the only remaining choice is A: \"the Big Band Era\".\n5. Thus, the answer must be A: \"the Big band Era\".\nAnswer: A: the Big band Era\n\n### Instructions:\nIn what order do you write your address on a letter?

{"text": "the day can increase one's endurance, you may ask Terese \"what do you mean by increases endurance?\"\n### Rationales:\n1.The prompt asks the reader to clarify the purpose of the statement Terese made.\n2. In Terese's words, she says \"running various distances throughout the day\". This indicates that she possibly made a misleading statement.\n3. The statement does not exactly clarify what Terese meant.\n4. Therefore, we need to explain and define what the previous phrase means.\n5. In this case, asking about the purpose of running is more suitable to determine what Terese was referring to. Hence, the answer choice could be: \"what do you mean about increases endurance?\"\nAnswer: C: what do you mean about increases\n\n### Input : The man in the green shirt is running out of breath. He must slow down in what capacity in comparison to the other runners? \n### Rationale:\n1. The prompt is talking about the man in the green shirts abilities as a runner.\n2. We know that he is trying to keep up with other runners.\n3. \"to slow down\" is an adverb that helps us determine how a man moves.\n4.

The question is of the form \"How many times ____ = X.\"\n2. It could be answered as follows:\n3. If _____ = 2, X = 58.\n4. Hence, the answer choice \"2\" fits because it is the same number of times that her marbles equals the given total of 58.\n5.

Going running could also possibly be a distraction from writing which could be seen in a negative Light.\nA: rests gives a positive association between the time of journaling (before/during/after) and the time of journaling being a distraction from writing (before). An option that would give a negative association between the time of writing (before/during) and listening to music in which listening to music could be seen as an afterthought or distraction from writing.\nD: eating seems to have the most direct correlation of activity and afterthought with an indirect correlation between listening to music in which eating might be related to the time of journaling in which the time spent eating might be seen as an after thought or distraction from writing since eating can be seen in a positive light such as the time of writing being the only negative aspect of journaling. \nD: eating could be positively associated to listening to music while writing in which listening to music might be seen as a distraction.\nThe journaling of Mack seems to be more of a meditative behavior where writing is the most important part and therefore it is more direct in showing a response after writing in which Mack either listens or goes running.\nTo summarize, the answer is D.

If the roads were icy yesterday, it means that they were made of ice. You cannot use salt on ice, the ice would then be melted. But when water melts on ice, a substance known as slush is formed.\n5.

{"text": "after he sold his old car, the number of zeros in the number $3,001 has how many? Choices:  D: 2 E: 4 A: 3 B: 1 C: 1\nRationales:\n1.The question asks us to determine the number of zeros in a number when the base number has a number of trailing zeros.\n2.Randy had $3000 after he had sold his old car and his new number of dollars was $3001, and he had two trailing zeros in his old number. \n3.We know that the number of trailing zeros in a number is equal to the remainder when we divide it by 10 and the quotient has at least one digit that has two trailing zeros.\n4.So, he had at least one digit with two trailing zeros, and the remainder of dividing the base number by ten is 0 (because the number of digits we are dividing by is higher than the digit with two trailing zeros (2 in the case of $3000).\n5.The total number of trailing zeros in the number $5,000,000 is four (because the number of trailing zeros is equal to the remainder of dividing that number by ten (4)).\n6.Hence, this rule does not fit here.\n7.Now, the number of trailing zeros for a number can be calculated only by dividing the number by one greater than the number it has, and multiplying the result by 10.\n8.A number like $13,264 would have two trailing zeros.\n9.But a number like $3,008 would not have any trailing zeros because dividing it by 10 (which happens to be one larger than 3) would give 146 (because 3008 =10 to the 146). \n10.Furthermore, 10 to the power of 146 is 3,008, and 10 to the 0th power is 1 (so, we cannot change that).\n11.There is no way we can bring the number of trailing zeros to at least one by dividing it by 9 or by 7 etc. because any number is greater than 1.\n12.Hence, we cannot determine from the base", "answer": " 2000"}
{"text": "0 seconds are not part of a whole number of seconds, what is the best way to describe the value of the missing portion? Choices:  Option A: part Option B: second Option B: non-whole Option D: 30 seconds\nRationales:\n1. The question is about the value of the missing fraction of a minute that sums to 24 but is not part of a whole second.\n2. This value can be described as either a part or a second, depending on the context.\n3. If the context is the total time span of the minute, then it is appropriate to refer to the missing fraction as a part.\n4. The phrase \"a part of\" suggests that the missing portion refers to a subset of the larger whole.\n5. The context can also be limited to the individual second that contains that missing fraction.\n6. Hence, Option B: \"a part\" is the best choice.\n7. The choice refers to the time-span of the total minute.\n8. It is clear this choice is more accurate in describing the missing value of the fraction.\n9. Option A: \"part\" refers to something smaller than the full second, but it is less specific than \"a part\".\n10. It is not necessarily referring to a specific fraction of that second and can be vague in describing a number that is not part of the whole.\n11. The choice refers to a specific fraction and can be used to describe the time, which is the first word in the context.\n12. Hence, the answer choice is Option B: \"part\".\n13. Option B: \"part\" is best because it is a better fit in the specific context provided and is more accurate in describing what that portion is. \n14. Option D: \"30 seconds\" is also an incorrect answer. In this context, 30 seconds is not a correct way to describe the value, since the value can be 24 or less than 30 at any time. Hence, this is an invalid choice.\n15. Option C: \"second\" is valid because it is a part of the whole second. However, it is redundant as a part can be described as a second.\n16.

The question is to determine the meaning of the phrase \"Cowabunger.\"\n2. The possible interpretation of the word is \"I'm tired,\" \"I'm hungr,\" or \"I'm glad.\"\n3. However, they are not the only interpretations, as it could also mean, \"I'm happy\" or \"Nice game.\"\n4. Let' A: \"I'm tired\" is an interpretation.\n5. Let B: \"I'm hunge\" is an interpretation. \n6. The answer choices are, A: \"I' m tired\" is false because if Harvey was tired, he would say so rather than \"Nice game.\" \n7. The answer choices B: \"I' m hungr\" is false because if Sam was hungry, he would say, \"I'm hunny.\" \n8. The answer choices C:\"I'm proud\" is false because the phrase does not convey any pride \n9. The answer choices D: \"I'm sad\" is false because the word \"cowabunger\" does not indicate feelings of sorrow. \n10. The answer choices E:\"I'm glad\" is false because \"glad\" is used in other sentences, however; it is not applicable in this sentence.\n11. The answer choices F:\"Nice game\" is the correct choice. If Sam had used this phrase, it would indicate that he was pleased with the winner, which is most likely a race, indicating that he is \"glad\" that the race was entertaining.\n12. The answer choice is F: \"Nice game.\" Because this is the only option that fully explains the full context of the sentence and the story line.\n13.

Choices:  a: because it is made out of water b: because it flows c: because it can be easily moved d: because it can be poured e: because it is fluid-like and doesn't have a shape\nRationales:1. The question refers to a \"book's paper\", so the book should be examined as a whole rather than the paper independently. \n2. We need to determine if the book's paper can be classified as a liquid.  \n3. Looking at each choice, we can find possible answers: \n4. Option A doesn't seem to be a satisfactory answer, because papers aren't necessarily made out of water.\n5. Options B and C make logical sense but not enough to make a statement.\n6. Therefore, Option E seems to be the best answer to this question.\n7.

It supports digestion and regulates blood sugar. Fruits may also aid in weight loss and aid with weight control thanks to their high fiber and water content.\nSometimes fruits are picked before they mature and then preserved to increase their shelf life and flavor. The food may be treated to preserve its quality for a longer period, increase its shelf life, or make it easier to consume. Food preservation may include a variety of procedures, such as canning, drying, or freezing, and various processing procedures, such as pasteurization. Canning food requires a heat process that completely destroys harmful organisms.\nVegetables are nutrient-dense foods with a wide range of health benefits and essential nutrients that are low in calories but high in fiber. Certain vegetables have a lot of minerals and vitamins for very little calories. Because they are low in calories, vegetables might be used as part of a weight-loss strategy. Green leafy vegetables, in particular, aid in the digestion of food and the absorption of nutrients by aiding in the movement of food through the digestive tract.\nGrains are foods from the grass family that include rice, wheat, maize, millet, and many more. Wheat, barley, and corn are the three most often consumed forms of grains. They are commonly consumed in the form of bread and pasta.\n\nIt's necessary to consume more food grains if you're trying to reduce your daily calorie intake to lose weight since they'll keep you full.\n\nAnswer:B: 600 Calories of Vegetables\n\n### Input : In the song, the singer wishes to go fishing where?

{"text": "what item for herself as birthday gift? Choices:  Flower A: Birthday balloon  B: Cake D: Candy E: Toy\nRationales:1. The question states that Avianna bought what for herself on her birthday.\n2. Avianna could have bought a birthday balloon, a birthday cake, birthday party, birthday card, birthday party favors, or a birthday gift.\n3. A birthday party is not an item in itself, so let's eliminate that choice.\n4. She could have bought it for herself in the form of a birthday card, birth certificate, birth announcement, birthday gift, birthday invitation, birthday cake, or birthday balloon.\n5. Birthday balloons are often given to kids on their birthday for entertainment. Birthday cakes, birthday balloons, and birthday invitations can be used to help with birthday celebrations. Birthday cards are used to mark the occasion with the signature of the giver, and birthday party favors are small presents for party guests.\n6. Considering this information, the most likely thing Avianna bought for herself was a birthday gift. This choice is more specific than birthday party favors and can take the form of many different items such as toys, clothing, electronics, and more.\n7. So, there are many possible choices here, we just need to narrow down to an item that is in some way more unique or special than what a child would likely receive as a birthday gift, like a cake.\n8. Now, choose between A or D. A: cake, this is not unique or special in itself. D: toy, toys can be in the form of anything and can vary widely in cost and value. \n9. Thus D: toy.

Then, we might explore each of Vaishali's hats and shoes and consider whether an outfit could be selected for each day, given the information provided.\n\n4.

The answer choices represent a combination of correct answers and incorrect answers.\n3. Let us analyze choices \"E\": 40 and \"F\": 4000 respectively\n4. 40 means that 0 and 60 are the correct answers, since 40 + 60 = 100. Hence, these are the correct answers, \"E\" and \"F\".

Similarly,  \"H\" multiplies 1 by 400, which would be the amount of bears Josh was given from his friend. \n8. \"J\" multiplies 1 with 87, which would be the same result as \"H\".

Consider \"the apples\" - Sara could be looking at certain apples in terms of size, color, and shape. However, the choice given is incorrect as she is not literally comparing the two apples.\n5. For \"the costs\", Sara could be comparing the two stores based on the prices at which the apples are being sold. Yet, that has not been alluded to in the context.\n6. Same with \"the customers\" - Sara is not directly comparing the two groups of buyers as the customers can be similar regardless of the store.\n7. And similarly, for \"the atmosphere\", Sara is not literally comparing which store has a better atmosphere.\n8. Therefore the \"the apples\" option is not the answer, as seen, and it goes on to \"the costs\". \n9. Sara could be comparing costs, and hence the appropriate comparison as per the question is \"the costs\", which is \"the apples\" and \"the costs\".\n10. This is the answer.\nAnswer: A&B", "answer": " 19"}
{"text": "bag, how much does he carry in total? Choices:  $:200 B: 12 C: 60 D: 52 E: 5\nRationales:1. The question is about how much Harry carries in his bag, which could be represented as the sum or total of the objects inside the bag. However, we have to consider the relationship between the number of books and the amount of money the books are worth, which will be the total Harry carries\n2. All the choices but $:200 has a different total from the actual choice E: 5 so we can eliminate them.\n3. B: $:200 can be eliminated because a bag has a maximum but not a minimum amount to carry.\n4. Harry's bag is an infinite space and hence can carry an uncountable amount of books and money.\n5. Harry has 52 books and $:50 so his total carrying is $:52\nAnswer: E: 5\n\n### Input : The man was in a rush to get somewhere, what was he wearing? Choices:  C: Jeans B: shoes C: shorts D: A: T-Shirt E: Turtle Shirt\nRationales:\n1. The man is described as having rushed somewhere, meaning he wants to get to his destination quickly.\n2. This suggests that he might be wearing something that is comfortable and easy to move around in.\n3. Consider \"C\": Jeans; we often put on jeans before we start walking somewhere, so it's possible he might be wearing jeans.\n4. For \"B\": shoes, it's possible that he is going for a run or walk, especially if it involves traveling, so it's fair to say he might be wearing shoes.\n5. However, it might not have been a rush, as we could see from other choices.\n6. Option \"D\": A: T-Shirts, does not provide evidence.\n7. Option \"E\": Turtle Shirt, does not provide evidence, either.\n8. Hence we are left with two possibilities, jeans or shoes.\n9. In light of this, we can conclude choice C: Jeans is the correct answer.\nAnswer: C: Jeans", "answer": " 175"}

Jackson has five times more money than Peter, so he has $0.\n2. Jackson's savings are now the same as Peter's debt, meaning he has $5 for savings and $5 for debt.\n3. Jackson's new $0 savings is five times Jacksons debt, which is $5.\n4. So after Jackson buys an unspecified object his new amount of money is $0.\n5. Peter must have five times $0 money + $0 in savings = $0 in total.\n6. So, Peter's debt would now be the same as Jackson's savings. Thus, Peter's debts remain as his original debt, which is 0.\n7. Peter's money is 0x5=0 dollars, which means their money is equal.\n8.

{"text": ", now what can't be eaten if he is successful? Choices: 1. A: lunch 2. B: school lunch 3. C: breakfast 4. D: dinner 5. E: brunch\nRationales:1. The question asks about the consequences of Tom Sawyer's friends. What is Tom Sawyer trying to trick his friends into doing?\n2. The answer choices are likely related to the act of tricking.\n3. Considering our first assumption, one possibility is that the answer could be lunch. However, this isn't feasible. Lunch is a type of meal, and we're looking for something that won't be eaten.\n4. So, \"school lunch\" would technically meet our requirements - it won't be eated by the school!\n5. Considering \"school lunches\" have been ruled out, let's move on to \"breakfast\", a different mealtime. Unfortunately, this is also ruled out. \"School breakfast\" isn't meant to be eaten by the school.\n6. \"Brunch\" is a meal between breakfast and lunch. Since \"breakfast\" and \"lunch\" have been ruled out before brunch, this should easily be determined as the correct answer.\n7. The answer is E: brunch. As \"school brunch\" isn't meant for the school to eat, you can't eat that either.\nAnswer: E : Brunch\n\n### Input : When does a car engine cool, when is it hot?

{"text": "children, each of them took their appropriate share.\nThe correct question is:\"Sam shared money between his three children,\" what part of the sentence did he _not__share? Choices: \nA: appropriate B: share C: sum of money D: children E: amount\nRationales:\n1. The phrase \"shared between three children\" implies that Sam shared a sum of money with three children, rather than individually sharing with each child.\n2. Therefore, Sam _did not_ share the money \"with each child\", which means choices A: appropriate, B: share, and D: children, can be eliminated.\n3. Sam also did not share the money \"to\" each child, which can be further determined by eliminating the option E: amount, since the amount itself is not what was shared between the children.\n4. Thus, only the choice C: sum of money remains.\n5. Sam shared a sum of _money_ with the children, not each child, so he _did not share_ the sum of money with each child. \n6.

In any bakery, the newest product or items are made as soon as they are finished. New products are commonly in the last stages of production. Answer A and B are not very likely. It is not usual to call a certain type or brand of bread \"the product.\" That word is more general. Answer C is not very logical either.

{"text": "of gas in a month. If he drives on average 10,000 miles a month, how much did he pay per mile? Choices:  Enter your answer here:\nRationales:\n1. The information given about James is that he buys $30,000 of gas in a month and drives on average 1,000 miles.\n2. Since James buys $30k worth of gas, he will have to pay more than $3 per gallon of gas. However, the average cost per gallon varies.\n3. The question then asks how much did he pay for a mile.\n4. The gas used will increase the miles driven, so the answer is going to depend on the gas consumption per mile.\n5. Let's go through the answer choices to find the answer.\n6. option A: James can fill a tank (1,000 - 1,500 miles) for $40 to $60.\n7. so option A does not fit.\n8. option B: If James bought $4,000 worth of fuel in a month, and drove an average of 1,00 miles, he will end up paying about ~ $4.\n9. option D: If James bought $12000 worth of motor oil in a month and drives, on average,1,000 mile then he ends up paying ~ ~ $12.\n10. option C: we can find cost of fuel by dividing the total cost by total number of miles he travel.\n11. If we divide the total cost by the total number of miles the average cost of each gallon of fuel he used is 2$.

This implies he wants to finish the yard work in order to free up time for other activities on his Sunday schedule. One of these other activities could be spending time with friends, shopping for groceries or relaxing. \n\nRationales:\nThe question asks for the reason behind Trey doing yard work, which is a task most likely assigned to him by his mother. When something is assigned to someone, they do the job for the benefit of someone else. In this case, it would be Trey's mother who would benefit if he completes the chores, since it would allow Trey more free time to use. \n\nOne of the answer choices is \"to accomplish the weekly chore\" which actually says that Trey is doing the work in order to complete a job assigned to him by his mom.

The first thing to do is to figure out the quantity of coins.\n2. This can be done using the formula =2B(1/2) = 2(0.5)(0.5) = 0.25\n3. Substitution: P(A) + P(B) = P(A & B) + P(A & \u00acB) + P(\u00acA & \u00acB).\n4. The sum of the probabilities of the different options is 1. This is the first line of solution.\n5.

The question explicitly states that the number of spokes on the bicycle is 20, indicating that extra spokes were added.\n\n3. Since the number of gears in a bicycle depends on how many spokes the wheel has, we can rule out the options B: 19 and D: 35 which don't add enough extra spokes to account for an additional gear.\n\n4. Option A says that the bicycle has 18 gears, but 21-20=1 meaning its incorrect.\n\n5. Finally, option C: 20 is the correct answer since it has an extra gear which is what the question says.\n\nRationales II:\n\n1. A bicycles typical gear ratio is 4 to 1, which means for every 4 revolutions of the pedals, it will travel 1 revolution of the wheel.\n\n2. A gear ratio of 2 to 1 indicates that an extra pedal revolution will lead to 2 revolutions of the wheel, providing a distinct advantage over the 4 to 1 gear ratio of a typical bicycle.\n\n3. Hence option A: 18 is incorrect since it does not add enough gears to double the benefit of the gear ratio.\n\n4.

If we examine each choice for the potential use of the sword, we get the following: a) I: with the help of \nanother person. This is definitely not an option. b) II: with string for support. String by itself wouldn't be strong enough for building a fort.\nc) III: with a robe for a base. A rope by itself wouldn't serve as the foundation, it would have to be tied or otherwise held in place in some way, so this isn't an option either.\nd) IV: with a knit for tearing up. The sword doesn't just magically make knives appear from thin air. e) V: with an angle cut for grinding. This seems like a valid choice at first.\nHowever, an angle grind would be more suited for sharpening the end of the sword than creating an actual blade, so this isn'\nt a suitable option either. 5. Choice V seems like the best option to use the sword to build a rope fort. However, the given clues\nsay that Tony wants to build the longest known rope fort in history, the largest possible. This is an obvious impossibility for anyone who isn't Superman, especially with a single sword.\n6.

{"text": "group of black ones. What can you say?\n\n### Description:\nThe phrase \"six more white birds\" suggests a comparison between six more individuals and the total number of individuals. The difference between these numbers is implied to be five, as the context implies that there were originally five white birds with the additional six appearing.\n\nIf a total of five white birds are paired with six black birds, then this would make ten total birds. This number, therefore, is a logical inference to arrive at when the phrasing \"six more white birds next to the group of black ones\" is observed.\n\nRationales:\n1. The phrase states that there are six more white birds to a group of black birds. There is a total of ten birds, at least one of which is a black bird. When one is a group of something, it is typically assumed that more than two exist. The phrase also states that more white birds exist - therefore, the total must be greater than ten. Hence, the total birds are eleven. This means that five white birds are present as well.\n2. Six black birds exist in the previous sentence; hence, ten birds in total. The phrase further states that there are six white birds added to ten, hence twelve. Six white birds are present when you exclude the black birds; however, six white birds cannot be added to ten without making a total of twelve. Ten birds, minus the six black birds would not give any white birds a number over six.\n3. When the black birds are subtracted, leaving ten white birds. The phrase then states that six more were added. This means that more white birds did not exist previously, otherwise the total would be an even number, and at least one black bird would also not be there. Now, the number is six extra and total twelve - as the two options of 'eleven' and 'twelve' have been excluded (both of which would fit the description), the number inevitably has to be eight. Six extra white birds were added, leaving only eight of a more extensive number of birds.\n4. If the total was twelve, either four white birds would have to subtract from a six (incorrect), or six black birds would have to add to a four - neither of which have been stated previously within the problem.\n5. Therefore, \"eight\" is the answer. It is the only number that can account for the number twelve (when the black birds", "answer": " 66"}

This question is asking for a word that fits within the theme of \"what can be found in nature but the world doesn't have it?\" which is generally understood to mean something that is positive or beneficial in nature.\n2. The world can be thought of as a whole or as a system of individual objects, so option C: \"land of governors\" is incorrect; the world doesn't contain governors or governments.\n3. Option D: \"fear\" isn't what we're looking for because the question is asking for something that is usually positive.\n4. Option E: \"no works\" doesn't refer to something that can be found in nature. In fact, nature is often seen as a source of work or energy in the form of the sun, wind, or other natural resources. Additionally, nature contains countless species of plants and animals doing different kinds of work within their ecosystems.\n5.

After all that, their last two games have yielded positive results including a win and a tie.What's the probability of winning the tournament?\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about the probability of the team winning the tournament by analyzing the game information.\n2. To help answer this question, we need to know what exactly the scenario has looked like so far.\n3. From 6 games, the team lost the first round, then won games 2 and 6 with the latter being a tie.\n4. But note the pattern. In those 6 games, they won or tied on alternating match.\n5. The team seems to be performing particularly well in the last two games, where they have won one and tied the next.\n6. This information gives us a pattern and a strategy to help us calculate the probability of winning.\n7. If they keep winning while alternating, then eventually they are more likely to win the tournament.\n8. This means that we need to calculate the probability of winning the 6th game for each tie game scenario.\n9. After winning the last two (6 & 7) consecutive games, this would be the case for the 6th game.\n10. So this is the best we can do at this stage where we know that the team has already won the last 2 games. \n11. Now let's analyze 6 games, where each game is against another team at the same site.\n12. And after 6 games, one team has already lost. So the probability of winning the last 2 games would be higher than winning those 2 games against one other team.\n13. This makes sense since the team already lost the first round by playing against 13 different teams.\n14. In a scenario where we play another team who already lost, the team is more likely to win than lose.\n15.

The statement \"divide it 3 evenly\" can be rewritten as \"multiply by the reciprocal of 3 = 1/3\". Thus, the three friends will deliver 33 pieces of art. Remember this for later.\n2. The second step is to figure out what fraction of art they will deliver. To do this, we must compare the art they deliver to the total art they were given. Since there is a total of 100 pieces  of art, the answer will be the remainder of our subtraction.\n3. So, suppose there are a total of 150 pieces of art for the three friends to deliver: 100 + 50. Now we must multiply the number of pieces of art each friend must deliver as well as the number of pieces of toal art they are given to.\n4. This gives us:  a*x/(100 + 2a) = 150.\n5. To divide fractions, we must write the numerator and denominator on the left side and right side respectively. Once we have this, the cross multiply:x / (100x1) /(3x1) = x/.\n6. Divide the numerator in the reciprocal of the denominator and simplify.\n7. Now the question is which fraction represents the reciprocal of what? The \"numerator\" is what they are given to deliver and the \"denominator\" is how many pieces of art their are in total.\n8. The numerator represents the fraction of art they must deliver and the denominator represents the total number of pieces of art, so it should be:  x/. The whole equation becomes:x/. 150 = 1/.\n9. So, by dividing the fraction of art they have to deliver by the fraction of total art they receive,", "answer": " 98"}

Option A: last week refers to a span of 7 days, including today, where the last day is the next week. Hence, this can be eliminated.\n4. Option B: this year refers to a span of time beginning at the start of this calendar and ending this year. Hence, we're looking for something happening this year.\n5. Option D: last year refers to a span beginning this year and ending last year. Since Camden went swimming this year, this is irrelevant to the question.\n6. Option E: last Tues will refer to a day this specific week, which includes today. Hence, this is irrelevant.\n7. Option C: January is a month, which could fall within a week, so this is not necessarily specific to this question. \n8. And last Tuesday refers to the fifth of January this year. Since we're looking for when he went swimming, not when it occurred, this is inessential.\n9.

BookStore  \nInput: waiting for a vehicle on the rail track.\nOutput: D. Train Station  \nExplanation: people waiting for a vehicle on train tracks usually do not buy anything so a bookstore would not be an appropriate choice. A vegetable seller would not sell vegetables from a train. So this problem is solvable.\n\n#### 3rd problem:\n\nA)human body B) repairs shops C) combustion engines E) service station  \nInput: oil is used.\nOutput: D) combustion engines  \nExplanation : Oil is used in vehicles in car engines. So it would have to be combustion engines.\n\n#### 4th problem:\n\nA. detachment B. Bankruptcy C. Sad D. Fights E. Wrong  \nInput: plans on stopping being married.\nOutput: A) detachment  \nExplanation I solved this question the same way as the 4th question, but i could have used a truth table to solve this question.

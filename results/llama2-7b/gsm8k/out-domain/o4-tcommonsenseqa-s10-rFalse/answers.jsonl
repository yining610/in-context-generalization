{"text": "Finding a formula is often an easier way of solving a problem, and you could even simplify and reduce a formula that does not contain variables, a formula looks pretty simple as we are dealing with just two letters, and when dealing with simple cases it is always recommended to try looking for a simple formula first, then looking for a more complex one, and although in this case there is only two letters, they have a wide range of values, which can in fact make the case more complex and complicated however we may be required to make assumptions about their values or in this case we can simplify the equation to help us find their values and answer this question..\n\nIf we look carefully at the formula \"x = 4b\" the number four means that x has to be four times the value of b, and this may help us determine the value of b and for that we can take the number 4 and take it away from b, and this means that b = number 4..\n\nThe next step in the problem is therefore to determine the value for x, and this can be done with a quick calculation, and since we have already found that b = 4 then x = 4*1 = 4, so we need to add 4 times Laurie's (L's) number of shells to that and this answer will be 4 + x = 4 + 4 = 8..\n\nAlan got 4 times the amount of shells than Ben did, Ben got a later start and only collected 1/3 of the shells of Laurie, he collected 36 shell, he wanted 8..\n\n### Conclusion:\nWriting more than one formula may help to solve a problem, and especially when we don't know what the answer is, this because we are not guaranteed that we will be able to solve the problem directly, as in this case Alan may have also collected some extra shells, which will make it a little more complicated than just getting the same number of shells for each person, so the answer to the question should be rounded down to 8 to give an estimated answer to the question.", "answer": " 48"}

He earned 16 * $33 + 3 * $10 which equals $546 + $30 for a total of $576. \nAdd that to his initial $33 cost, which leaves us with $576 - $33, or $543. However, that still leaves the three customers to tip him. One of them gave him a $5 tip and the other two each gave him a $2 tip. The final amount is therefore 16 * $5 + 3 * $2. That gives us $85 + $6 = $91. Again, divide  $91 by $33 to arrive at $271.19 rounded to the nearest cent.

Choices: A: curtains \nB: tailor shop \nC: clothing store \nD: sewing room \nE: hardware store\n\nAnswer: B:tailor shop\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe algorithm is able to recognize the difference between when a tailor is not providing all the services a person needs and when a tailor is providing all the services a tailor can be found in. The answer for if a tailor is the correct answer for each of the input questions, but it does not recognize that a seller can provide many different services. The correct output was to choose a clothing store, because a clothing store has a variety of services which a tailor would not be able to provide. The algorithm was unable to detect clothing store when question asked about buying a shirt needing to get altered and fit when it needs to be provided by a tailor shop or a sewing room.", "answer": " 5"}

She takes 3 total days off; Monday, Tuesday, Thursday. For Rosie to run 10 more hours for 20 miles, we take the number of days off times the the number of hours she ran divided by 6.

But all odd numbers are odd, so no. The smallest even number is 2. Any fraction over 1.5 would not work since even number can never be over a half.

{"text": "Roberto can skip 4,000 times an hour while Valerie can skip 60 times a minute. Roberto and Valerie can skip a combined 4,208 skips an hour. Roberto and Valerie will skip a combined 66 minutes an hour.\n### Explanation:\n\nTo solve the problem, you need to find the sum of the two skips for each time. In order to do this, the problem must be written as an equation. Skips = time is the equation you need to start with.\n\nSkips = time\n\nThen, each part may be used to find the correct answer. For this problem, you can ignore the skips each person made in the allotted time. Only the skips each person can make at a certain given time need to be calculated.\n\nTime x 60 (for Val) + Time x 4,202 (for Roberto) = total skips in one hour\n\n60 x Time + 4,204 x Time = total skips in an hour\n\n112,108 = total skips in a one-hour period.\n\nThen, 180 minutes can be deducted from the solution to find that the total number of skips in an hour is 112,150 skips per hour.", "answer": " 2,250"}

The total of 30 items have 15 items that are yellow and 15 that are orange.

I started out determining the food on the entire shop; that would be 30. One third of total food was next calculated. The total food equals 30 and one third of that total would be 20. \n\n```\nyellow food|yellow grocery|orange food|orange grocery|total food\n30       |0           |15      |15         |30\n```\nWe would need the color of the food for three stores next.

If you plant 9seeds you would plant one tree and if you plant 12 seed then you are planting 2 trees.\n\nHe is planting 2 trees total because planting seed has to do with plants if he plants seeds then there is going to be some plants then their would be 20 plants for each tree and then he would plant at least 60 for each tree because he planted 60% of 20 plants and they would go to 20 in each tree. Because there are 2 trees and he plant 60% so 2 trees x 60%  so that give you 40% so that's how many seeds you would have to plant in both of the trees.\n\nSo if he plant 40%.

With a normal body temperature (36.7\u00b0C) you will have to travel from New Hampshire to Florida to have a average body temperature equal to 37\u00b0C.\n\n### Response \n\n37-23 = 14 \u00b0C\n\n### Explantions\n\nFlorida's latitude is 24\u00b0 in latitude (Southern Hemisphere) and is closer to the equator.

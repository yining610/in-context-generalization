{"text": "1. This question will need three subtractions: subtracting the number of yellow flowers from the number of flowers in the garden,  subtracting 80% of the number of yellow flowers, and subtracting 1/3 of the number of green flowers.\n2. We will have to begin by identifying the total number of flowers in the whole garden.\n3. First we need to get the number of flowers in Mark\u2019s garden. Ten of them are flowers. \n4. We know that there are 1000 flowers in the garden. We know the percentage on yellow flowers: 1000 \u22c5 10% = 100 and so yellow flowers make up 100 flowers out of a total of 1000 in the garden.  This means that there are 900 flowers in the  garden. So, we know that there are one hundred yellow flowers in the garden. \n5. What we need to do is take 80% of 100 flowers. Since there are 10 yellow flowers in the garden and there are 8 other flowers in each color, we need to make sure they are all taken into account  and not just 8 flowers out of 100. So, how do we show in our equation that we are taking 80% - 8 of the other flowers? To do this, multiply 100 flowers and 80%, then subtract the 10 yellow flowers to get the remaining 80 flowers. So, 100 \u22c5 80% = 80, and 80% -10 = 60, so the remainder is 60.\n\n6. Finally, the number of green flowers is 75 in comparison to the total number of flowers.  \nFor example, if there are 10 green flowers out of total 999 flowers, this will represent 1%. The same formula applies to this example.\n\n\nLet's find the total number first by applying the formula for percentages, which is: p(100) = p \u22c5 q / 100. p=(percentage) = 75/100, q = - = 999 - 100 = - = 899.\nSo there are 899 flowers in total.", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "1.```````````````The first question that we need to answer is what Tina's base pay rate is\u201418.00.\nWe know that she's eligible for over time if she works more than 10 hours per day, but if she works too much, there's a penalty\u2014an hourly rate of pay of about half of what she normally makes.  So we can set up a two different rate equation: \n  18.00\u201418.0(0.5) = 8.0.  Tina's base hourly pay,\n   18.00\u2212 (8.00) = 10.0\\. her bonus hourly rate, and\n   18.30  \u2014  (8.30) = \u22120.30\\. the penalty for working more than the maximum number of hours.\n\nThe second thing to solve for is how much she worked in the first place\u2014the number of hours.  She's working 10 hours per shift, so there are two shifts.  This gives us a total of 20 hours or 1 shift + 1 shift: \n   18.40 \u00d7 2 \u2212 (8.30 \u00d7 1) = 100 - 8.30 = 91.7\\)\n\nThe last thing to solve for is the overtime bonus.  We know that the overtime bonus is 1/2 her hourly rate of pay, and that total pay is 75.00 + 66.90, so her overtime bonus is 66.92\n20hours + 100 hrs + (20 hrs) = 150 hrs.\nTheir bonus is (20 hrs * 150/20) = 300 hrs.\n`\n# \n```", "answer": " 990"}

{"text": "1.. It is worth mentioning here that if the above condition remains the same (i.e., John takes away 6 green hard hats and twice the number of pink hats that Carl takes away, where x indicates the total number of pink hatts that Carl takes away).\n2. Next, we will write down a list of all the things we know given the conditions in the problem:\n3. There are 26 pinks and 15 greens hats in the truck. Let's call them X and Y respectively so we can denote those variables later on. Therefore, X + Y are the total numbers hat in the truck. Given that, we can see that there is a total number of Y hats remaining in the truck. If we know from this equation that John takes away X hats and Y, it means that when John removed X hats, there were X - Y hats remaining in total. This can be written as: X - y = (x - y) =x + y.\n4. Next, let's calculate what Carl did: first he took away 4 hats, so at that moment there are 26 - 4 = 23 left. He took away more than he took, so we know that he removed at least 4 hats:\n5. Let's call these 4 hats he removed A,B,C,D. Then what was left in the truck was 26 - A - B - C - D = 20.\n6. After that John took away 6 hats. Given that each of the six hats John took away is \"twice\" the number of hats Carl took, there must be 6X number of pink htats in total and 12Y number of Y. If 20 remains then: Y must be = Y - 12 (6 \u00d7 pink that Carl took)\n7. We should be able to simplify to Y = X - 12(6.\n8. Using that, we can solve for Y = (X - 12(X + 12(X - 12))) / 12 X\n9.

{"text": "1. The question requires you to find Ironman's age given that Thor is 1485 years old. \n2. Since the information is provided in a ratio format, it is important to convert it to an equation.\n3. To do this, we'll need to multiply the first ratio by 5/13 and the second ratio by 13/5, which will make both ratios 1:2.\n4. To solve for the first ratio, you'll need to have 2 values, one for the numerator and one for the denominator. To do this, you can add the denominators, which will result in (1 + 2) / 3.  You can then use this to find the ratio of the first age, which will be 1;2.\n5. Similarly, you'll need (1) / 1:2 to solve for the second ratio.\n6. This process can be repeated for the other ratios, so for the third ratio you'll end up with ((1 + 3) / 2) / (1:2), so it would be (1 + 3) : (2 * 5).\n7. When this process is done for all 3 of the ratios, you'll have gotten a single equation of (1) : (2) : (3 * 2) : (5 * 13), which can be simplified into (1) : (7) : (32 * 5) : (1456 * 13). You can evaluate this equation, but you can use order of operations to simplify it to (1) : (5) : (7 * 13) : (1404).

{"text": "1.\"The question clearly states that the washing machine needs 20 gallons for a heavy wash and 10 for a regular wash. So we can see that it's always safe for our use if we choose 30 gallons (20+10) as a starting value for water needed.\n2.From the other side, we can see that one heavy wash and one regular wash cycle will take away 30 gallons, and that will leave us with light wash cycle as 1 gallon will be used for rinsing off the first heavy wash and regular wash, respectively, and 2 light wash cycles will be used to rinse off another heavy wash and another regular wash.\n3. As 2 regular wash cycle adds up to 10, the first extra light wash will remove 1 gallon and the second one will reduce 2 gallons. In all 3 washes, we are only adding an extra 1-2 gallons, which is negligible.\n4. We can use this as 30-20 (our starting value) = 10, i.e. the washing cycle ends up using 10 gallons, which includes the 2 gallons in the extra light washes.

The question says it in two different ways, but it's basically this: if a tree that's 20 years old cannot be recycled then it can be cut till it's 40 years old, at which point it will need to be recycled, therefore take at least 40-20 = 20 years on average to deplete the amount of old trees we can use, which is why we take 20 years as the average length of time.", "answer": " 76"}

Choices: 1. 94. 2. half of 47. 3. half of 556. 4. whole number.\nOutput: \n\nThe sequence of whole numbers (or integers), the sequence of numbers which begins with the unit of one (or 1) and includes every value between any two given whole numbers, increases by a constant number each time. To find whether a number is or is not part of that sequence, we can examine whether that number is an even whole number raised to some power.  \n\n1) 94: Even number squared, but not even whole number itself.  \n2) 556: Even number squared itself.  \n3) 47: Not an even number squared.  \nWe can thus conclude that the number 4 does not belong in the sequence of whole numbers.\n\n\nTo solve this problem, we should use the sequence of whole numbers, 1, 2, 4, 8, etc., to reasonably calculate the fraction that is the \"best\" fraction to add to the number of a whole, to make the number an even whole number. For every even whole number that we raise to the power of 1/2, the value of the number is less than or equal to the value of 2.\n\n\nThe best, most intuitive and the easiest to explain fraction would be 2.

{"text": "1. The question implies that the chairs and tables are a part of the company's furniture inventory, indicating that the total quantity of furniture Kenzo's company has is 100. \n2. For the tables, the choice with \"three legs\" is the correct one because it implies that the total number of legs in one table is 3.\n3. On the other hand, the choice with \"five legs\" is incorrect because 5 is not a perfect multiple or divisor of 40, so the total number of legs for the chairs cannot be reduced by 5. Also, since the question is asking for the number of legs left remaining, it should be the number of legs that's reduced.\n4. The formula to calculate the total number of remaining legs is: NumberRemaining = NumberBeforeReduction - (NumberBeforeReduction divided by NumberToBeDivided).\n5. The number of legs after the reduction is 60, which is calculated with the formula: NumberAfterReduction = (NumberBeforeReduced) - (NumberBeforeRreduction divided by NumberToDivide).\n6. Number of legs to reduce is 80, which is converted to a fraction with numerator 80 and denominator 100.\n7. The formula for calculating the number of legs, Number Before Reduction, subtracted from the original number of legs is: NumberRemained = NumberBeforeReduced*100/Numerator.\n8. Numerator is equal to 80 and denominators is 100, so the formula 80*1/100 = 149/100 becomes NumberRemained = NumberAfterReduced * 149/ 100\n9. The number of total legs is 169, which is calculated with: NumberOfTotal Legs = NumberRemained * 100/Denominator\n10. Total number of remaining legs is 60 which leads to TotalNumberOfRemainedLegs = Number 60 * 100 / Denominator\n11.

To solve the problem correctly, we need to substitute age for a number and use the formula to find the age of the two people.\n3. \"Ten years\" is a specified period of time, but it does not provide a value for age.\n4. We could interpret \"ten years\" to indicate time as a measure or the passage of time (as in \"an eternity\"), but that's not what the question asks.\n5. So, we must choose the actual value for age that makes sense.\n6. We need to factor in the given information and substitute the appropriate values.\n7. The question makes clear that the younger person is 10 years younger (as in 10 * 1) than the elder sibling, who is presumably 20 years older (20 * 1) at 30 years of age.\n8. This would leave the younger sibling at 20 years old when the formula is solved.\n9. So, the sibling younger than the interview applicant is 20, making the 20 years older 30 years at the present time.\n10.

It\u2019s also important to note that snow doesn\u2019t pile evenly, so we subtract from the current depth, which is 34 inches. We can\u2019t make it 0 because it\u2019s 34, not 0.\n3.

The base penalty is $50, but the speeding penalty (going 15 mph over the speed limit) is $10, which we need to add to the base penalty.\n3) In this case, since Mark was driving 45 mph in a 30 mph zone (going 15mph over the speed limit), he owes $65 for the base fine and the speeding penalty.\n4) Finally, we calculate the total fine for having gone through a school zone. Since this is a criminal conviction based on the fact that the ticket was issued in a school zone, the base fine in this circumstance is $100.

There are two main reasons that indicate this is the case:\n2a)The last sentence in the prompt states that Sarah has twice as many as Jim, which would mean that Sarah would have twice as many toads than she started with.\n-2b)The first sentence gives us a piece of information that tells us Sarah started with how many toads again? How many toads did she start with? We know she started with 30 toads, from the first sentence.\n-So Sarah started with 30 and Jim has 20 toads. If Jim had 20 more toad than Tim, it means that he now has 40 toads. So, that means Sarah started with 320 toads.\n-But we know she started with how many toad?

This gives us a ratio of 4:6, so we can represent this using the equation `r = distance_jogged/time_run`\n5. The total distance travelled would be the time spent  running multiplied by the constant rate at which John is jogging.\n6. So, the total distance travelled can be computed as follows:\n`( \\frac{30}{4} + \\frac{30\\times 4}{2})x6`\n7. This gives us an answer of `48x6 = 288`.

It then goes on to state that Henry and Paul combined ended up collecting 59 shells each. This means that of the 59, Henry collected 11 seashells and John collected 24. It then asks about a new total.\n4. \"In total now\" is a little confusing. It could mean any of these options, but it's likely that it means \"all together, including those we've collected and those we've given away\".\n5. We also know that Leo has given away 1/4 of his seashells. If he keeps and gifts away one-quarter of the seashells he has, he will only be left with a quarter of his original amount.\n6. This means he has 8 seashells left in total.\n7. We know this because for 8 seashells, 24 = 16, leaving 2 remaining shells. 16 + 2 = 18, which is 18/4 or 4.5.\n8. Therefore, we know that there was a total of 59 seashell collected, with 11 being Henry's and 24 being John's. Leo gave away one-quarter or 4.5 or his seashells, leaving 8.

We need to solve these equations for x and y to find out how many dollars in sales Village Foods receives per month for lettuce and tomatoes.\n9. Let's begin with the equation for lettuce sales:\n10. Because the letter \"x\" is already in the expression, the letter \"x\" must appear inside the brackets, to account for the parentheses in the parenthesis outside the brackets. We can, therefore, move the parentheses closer together to form a product and distribute the product symbol to match the parentheses:\n11. Next, the letters \"x\" and \"1\" must also appear inside the brackets, as they are already in the equation:\n12. Thus, we can rearrange the bracketed part of the formula to read:\n13. We can multiply both sides of the equation by (1/2) to eliminate the fraction:\n14. Because the letters \"x\" cannot be placed anywhere else in the equation, we can only use the letters \"x\" for lettuce sales as they were given, and all other variables (y) to be assigned to tomato sales:\n15.

{"text": "This question is about two people, Nadia and Hannah, who walked the same total distance (18 kilometers), but Nadia walked more.  So we want to use twice (2x) and subtract (\u2212).\n1. We first need to identify that we are multiplying by 2 and we are subtracting to get the total distance walked by both Nadia and Hannah.\n2. Multiplying by 2x is equal to 2\u00d718 because we multiply 2x by 18. This calculation gives us 36.\n3. We now know that 36 km is twice the total distance walked by Nadia and Hannah and that we are subtracting, but we don\u2019t know their individual distances.\n4. So, we substitute the distance Nadia walked for 36 + 18, which would be 54 (we subtract 36 from 54 to get the individual distances).\n5. We are now looking at a situation where both Nadia and Hannan walked 18 km, but Hannan walked 2\u00d718 -36 = 18 km.\n6. We substitute Hannan\u2019s total distance by + 18 and then add + 36 kilometers to get the total distance covered.\n7. Adding 36 + 36 + 2(18) would give us the total distance covered by both Nadia and Hanann.\n8.

We can identify the remaining digits from those choices.\n1. We begin by figuring out that the first missing number is 5, and the missing letter is D. This is because the pattern from numbers 1 through 15 has 5 numbers missing and D is the missing letter.\n2. The second number is also 5. This is because there is still a pattern of 1 missing number and 5 missing letters (with the letter D removed). The pattern repeats from 2 through 25.\n3.

The total number of cans and bottles will be the sum of the soda cans and the sparkling water cans.\n5. The total number of soda cans consumed was 50 so we'll start by subtracting this number from the total number of cans which is 90.\n6. We're told that four-fifths consumed juice\n7. Now add 40 recyclable juice bottles to the original number of cans. The total recyclable can collection is 40 + 90 or 130 cans.\n8. We are told that two-thirds drank sparkling water.\n9. Subtract the sparkling water can count from the original count of cans to get the sparkling water used in one-third (40 - 50 = 10). So the sparkling water collection will be 10.\n10. Add 10 from the sparkling water collection to original number of cans to get 90.\n11. Subtract the juice bottles drank - four-fifths - from the total number of bottles available to get the number of bottles consumed.\n12. Add the recyclable juices to the collection.

Choices:  The least temperature at which humans can survive is A:  minus 40 degrees B: below 28 degrees C: 0 degrees D: 25 Fahrenheit  The least temperature at humans can live is E:- 28\nOutput: 1;The temperature in the question doesn't explicitly provide the unit, so we need to use our knowledge of human physiology and thermoregulation to determine the answer.\n\n2. Generally, in a human body, the temperature range between 37-38 degrees Celsius is considered optimal, and any significant deviations from this range can be dangerous and even life-threatening.\n\n3. While there have been reports of individuals surviving at body temperatures lower than 37 degrees Celsius, it's important to note that these cases are rarer, non-reproducible, and usually involve extreme environmental conditions, such as frostbite-induced vasodilation or hypothermia-induced tissue insulation. These individuals may not survive for long, and even if they do, there's an increased risk of long-term health problems.\n\n4. Additionally, it's worth noting that while the human body can tolerate low temperatures to some extent, it can't tolerate hot temperatures. Above 38 degrees Celsium, the body's core temperature rises, resulting in a condition called hyperthermia, which can be fatal if left unaddressed.\n\n5. Furthermore, it's not possible to survive outside the body's norma temperature indefinitely. Even if an individual were to survive at low temperatures, they would eventually succumb to hypothermia and death.\n\n6. Overall, the", "answer": " 480"}

We need to determine how many letters Bobbie takes from her last name, in order to determine how many letters Jamie's last is, if we know her full name.\n4. We know for certain that Bobbie and Jamie have 5 letters each in their full names, because we are given that full names can each have 5 letters.\n5. Thus, we can find that _if two letters are taken from Jamie's full name, the remaining letter is 3 letters_.\n6. We then know that Jamie's last word is _3 letters_.\n7. We can substitute in the information about the full names of Samantha and Jamie and deduce that Bobbie took 2 letters from her full name, and the resulting abbreviation had to have been either \"Sam\"(3 letters) or \"Sami\" (4 letters). We can eliminate \"Sam\" because we know that Samantha's full name is longer than Jamie's by 5 letters, and for this to be true, \"Sam\" has to have more letters than Samantha's.\n8. Thus, Bobbie's abbreviation is either \"Sami\" (with 4 letters) or \"Samie\" (with 5 letters).\n9. We also know that Samantha and Jamies' last names both 5 letters long, and Bobbie's abbreviations can only have 4 or 5.

In English, the word for the number \"3\" is pronounced \"three.\" Thus, there is no need to use the \"th\" sound when writing the number 3, since it is written as \"3.\"\n2.) Choice A is also correct: the number 3 can be written as \"3.\" \n3.) Choice B is incorrect: while \"ty\" could be used in speech to represent the sound of the letter \"s\", \"ty\" is not the correct spelling for this sound in written form, as spelled \"3 t y\", since \"ty\" is not a recognizable English word. \n4.) Choice C is also not correct: \"teen\" is an adjective that refers to a person's age, not a number, therefore it cannot be used to represent the number 3.\n5.) Choice D is not correct either since \"twenties\" is the plural form of the word \"twenty,\" which refers to 20 objects, not 3 objects.\n6.) Choice E is correct as well: \"3 twenties\" is a valid phrase and is a word for the number 3. \nSo", "answer": " 4"}

If all the seats at a movie theatre are sold, 50% of them are occupied. If there are 7 more seats in the theatre which are always left empty, the remaining seats are occupied by 1/3 of all the people who bought a ticket. How many seats were sold at this movie theatre?\nOutput: A. The first step is to calculate how many seats are left unoccupied given that half of all seats in the theatre are occupied and there are seven empty seats (which always remain empty). This involves subtracting 50% of the total number of seats from five-sevenths (which is 7/7, or 1/7). The answer is that seven empty seats remain in this scenario.\nB. Next, we need to find what percent of all the seats that were sold the ticket were occupied. This calculation involves taking one third (3/12) of the number of empty seats that remain (the number of unoccupied seats that remain after 50% of all seats are left vacant). We get 3/12, or 25%.\nC. Finally, we need to find how many seats were sold in total. We need to multiply the percent of seats that were sold by the number of seats sold (which is the number of seats plus the number of unoccupied remaining seats). The answer in this case is that 25/12 = 2/3 = 66.67%.\n\n### Instruction:Solve all the question", "answer": " 48"}

So, the answer is 1.875  (6/3) But it is possible that  the man is 1 person. When we take 1, 18 people are more than 3 clerks (18 - 3 = 15), So, again we can't use it.

In the same way as with x and y we can simplify this. (75% \u2013 x)/(75% \u2013 y))\n4.

We also know that on Wednesday, he could have watched on the Hallmark channel twice as many moviews as he did Tuesday. \n###   We know that the next Tuesday (the day  after his birthday, which was Tuesday), the day he watched 2.4 Hallmark movies\n###  We need to get the number of total movies of the Hallmark channel\n###  If we take the number of how many on the Hallmark channel are the Tuesday before his Birthday, then he will watch 2.4 movies. And also on Saturday, he will watch 4 Hallmark movies.\n###  The total number of movies that Grandpa could have watched is 2 + 4 = 6 full-length movies.\n##\nSo the final answer in that problem is 6 full-length Hallmark channel movies. \n\n\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Solution 2:\n\n\n\n\n##### Instruction:Analyze the following string and then type in the answer.\n\nInput: \"The apple did not fall far from the tree.\"\nOutput: \"The apple did [not] fall [from] the tree.\"\n\n##### Instructions:\n\nGive me your answer.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "1-  In order to solve this question, we need to know the cost per square foot of the property as a whole.\n2. We first calculate the cost of the house based on the prices of $98 per square ft: $98 x2,400 = $23,840.\n3. Next, we calculate the cost of the barn based on the same prices: $98 x 1,00 = $98,000.\n4. The total cost of the property is the sum of the two previous values: $23,800 + $98,090 = $121,890.\n5. The question asks how much the property is - we already know that the total cost is $121,000. The amount of square feet tells us that the first and second cost is $23,890 (2400 sqft)/98 and $98,020 (1000 sqft)/38.\n6. The square feet, when multiplied by the respective costs, will provide us with the price for the house and the barn, respectively. We can now substitute the square foot values and find the final cost for the property.\n7. Since $98 x 2400 = $ 23,849.20 (rounded to nearest dollar): $23,850.00/0.77700475097 (rounded to 3 digits with 0 decimals) = $30,727.77.\n8. And since $98 x 98 = $97,919.60: $97,920.00/ 0.7774 (rounded to 2 digits with 0 decs) = $125,183.75.\n9. Combining the two final costs, we get $121, 890 as the total price of the property of 2,406.31 (rounded to 0 decimals with 2 digits) square feet.\nSo the final Answer is $121890.00", "answer": " 333200"}

There are five options, \"Under the table\", \"on the floor\", \"next to the window\", \"in the cabinet\", and \"facing south.\"\n3. \"Facing south\" is not a literal location where chairs could be located. It's a descriptive phrase that means a chair faces in the south direction, which is not an option.\n4. \"on the floor\" is inappropriate because floors typically aren't used to store chairs.\n5.\"In the cabinet\" could be correct if there are chairs in a cabinet. We need to know if the chairs are located somewhere in a cabinet or a cabinet has chairs stored within.\n6. Since three of the options are literal locations, we can eliminate the other two (\"facing south\" and \"on the floor\").\n7. Choices \"Under the table\" and \"next to the window\" are both locations, but they're not specific enough. We need to know whether or not the chairs are under the table or next to the window.\n8 The word \"next to the window,\" for example, would allow for the chairs to be under the window or next to the window, both of which are incorrect.\n9.

{"text": "1.\"Carrie is wrapping three presents:\" Since there are three presents, the number of wrappings required is directly proportional to the number of presents. This suggests that the question follows the form \"X=K * Y,\" where \"X\" is the number of wrappings and \"Y\" is the number of presents, and \"K\" is the proportionality constant.\n\n2. \"One present needs two square feet:\" The number of square feet required for a single present is directly proportional to the square feet requirement of the other presents combined. This suggests that \"Y=K * (X + X + X),\" where \"Y\" is the square feet requirement of a single present and \"X\" is the square feet required by each of the other presents.\n\n3. \"The second present needs three-fourths of that amount:\" The square feet requirement of the second present is inversely proportional to the square feet required by the first present. Therefore, the equation is \"Y = 4/5 * X.\" Since \"X\" is given by the previous calculation, \"Y\" can be calculated as \"Y = 4 / 5 * 3 / 2,\" or \"Y = 6 / 10.\"\n\n4. \"The third present needs the same value as both other presents put:\" The square feet requirement for the third present is not given, but we can deduce that it is equal to the sum of the other presents' requirements, since the statement explicitly states that the requirements are equal. This suggests that the requirement is also directly proportional to the number \"X.\" Since the requirements are the same amount, the coefficient of proportionality is also the same in both cases, which yields \"K = 1 / 2.\" Therefore, the equation for the third present's requirement is \"Y = 0.5 X,\" which simplifies to \"Y = X.\"\n5. Now that we have all of the equations in place, we can sum them together to find the total number of square feet required, which is \"0.5 X + 6 / 15 + X.\" This simplifies to \"1.5 X + 5 / 15\"; we can cancel the 5s and multiply both sides by 15 to get \"Y [answer] = 30 square feet [exact answer].\"\n6.

{"text": "Solution:  First of all, it is assumed that 90-minutes = 90/2 = 45 minutes, since a soccer game typically is 90 minutes long.\n7. Then it is asked, \"How long was he on the side line?\"\n8. If he first played 20 minutes in one segment, then played another 35 minutes in the other segment, it can be inferred that the first segment he played in was \"45 minutes\" and the second was \"35 minutes\".\n9. The first choice of time of which he played \"20\" minutes has his time as 20 and total as 55 minutes.\n10. The second choice of time of which played \"35\" minutes, has his time as 35 minutes and total as 90 minutes. Since he played for 35 minutes it can be inferred the he had 20 minutes rest. Therefore, the total time he played for was 90 minutes of which he initially played for 55 minutes followed by 35 minutes rest (20+35 = 55+35 = 90).\n11. Accordingly, option A is not the correct answer.\n12. Similarly, option B is not correct either since his time played is 90 minutes and total 90 minutes.\n13. Option C is wrong also. His time was not 60, then rest. It was 90 minutes total (45 + 45 = 90) and he played for 55 of them (20 + 35 = 50 + 35 (since he rested)) and the total time was 90.\n14.

Here's what you can do:\n\nYou can say \"We can use this\" and explain how you can eliminate choices for that. For example the second question, where A and F aren't acceptable because they're the same object. Or C and E aren't acceptable because we can use those in A or F and it's redundant. But that's only one aspect of this.\n\nSecond, you can say \"This is right\" with justifications. Not only are the sentences grammatically correct and not incorrect, but also they're complete sentences to begin with because they don't only end in a punctuation mark, or start with a punctuation mark. And because you stated that they're grammatically correct/complete sentences, you can just as easily start with the question and add how you could eliminate other answers.\n\nYou don't always need to end sentences with a punctuation marks, it's not a requirement. Some sentences can just end mid-way, without the need for a conjunction at the end, and you still have a complete sentence.\n\nYou also don't always need a statement to end with a \"but\", the word \"BUT\" is a conjunction after all, just as \"AND\", \"BUT\" can be an and/or OR a conjunction. Here \"but\" is the only correct answer to that sentence. You used the wrong conjunction, but your answer is still acceptable and correct.\n\nThere isn't a need to always add a statement such as \"That makes", "answer": " 192000000"}

We can add the number of hours Bryan works each day (8 hours) together with the number of hours he spends on marketing posts each day (2+2 = 4). \n5. This tells us that Bryan spends a total of 9 hours on marketing posts each week.\n6. This means he works 5 hours for every 10 hours he spends on his job, which is a 50% time-usage ratio.\nSo the final math answer is D: 50%", "answer": " 2"}

How many bikes were in the bike lion? Choices: A: none B: 5 C: 6 D:7 E: 13\nOutput: 4  The sentence describes how many bikes were in order.\n4. Bikes were all in order, because they were in a bike lane\n1. The youngest, and therefore only one bike, was out of order\n3. If the oldest bike is closest to the curb, then the second bike, which is the youngest, is closest to the lane, and the third bike is the oldest\n4. We therefore count the bikes from the youngest, the second bike, to the oldest, the very last bike, but NOT including the bike closer to the curb\n5. This is because in this answer, the youngest is also the oldest (youngest second bike)\n6. Because the youngest is also oldest, and it is the only bike that is not in order, we need to add the youngest to the end\n1. We then have to subtract the only one bike that was not in order, which was the youngest bike\n2. Therefore, there were 5 bikes, not 13\n\nInput: A man with a beard visited the zoo, where he saw a lion, a monkey, and a leopard. Is he sure? Choices: A B C D E\nOutput", "answer": " 6"}

We can interpret that the goal is 10 cuts and that Calvin is halfway to that goal.\n4. In order to solve, we need to know what 50% is as a decimal. Using mental arithmetic, we can divide this number in half and multiply it by 10. This gives us 5%. Therefore, we can interpret that Calvin is 5% of the way towards his goal.\nSo the final calculation is: .5 * 10 = 5%\nSo, the percentage towards his goal is 5%.\n\nInput: A team\u2019s probability of winning next matches depends only on their success ratio from the last 3 matches or so.\nThe team with the best success ratio should always win.\nIf there are several teams having the same success ratio and if so, the team that has least matches won should win.\nOutput: 1.\u201cThe question is asking about the probability that a given team will win.\n2. The answer is \"C\".\n3. We know that the probability of winning will depend on whether a team has won 3 or more matches, but not if it has won 4 or more matches.\n4. We can reasonably assume that a team playing very well will definitely win more than 30% of their games.\n5. Since a team cannot win more matches than they have played, they must eventually stop winning matches and start losing matches.\n6. We can eliminate B because a team with 60% will win far more than 35% of matches and will therefore never lose 65% since no one can win more than 100% of games.\n7. We can also eliminate A because a team winning 65% of matches will never be under.35 since winning more than 50% of games means winning more than 5 matches in a row out of 10 possible games.\n8.

No other information is provided. In the context of the problem, there is no reason why Flora shouldn't spend her entire weekly wage on groceries and clothing, so the total number of groceries and clothe purchases must equal the weekly wage.\n2: We know that Flora\u2019s weekly wage is a total of [8.25 + 2.75 + 0.5] dollars, and she spent that wage on grocerie & clothing; so those values would be on the correct side of the equation.\n3: Total weekly cost of groceries + weekly cost of clothing divided by week wage.\n(153.2 + 68.75)/8.25 = 153.20 + 68.8/8.25=154.25 which is equivalent[154.5/8.25]\nSo the final 154.5 is equal to(162.25-8.25/8.29]\n\nInput: After buying 300 pencils and 5 packs of paper,", "answer": " 2"}

The possible divisors, including the \"each person gets the same number\" constraint, is much larger than the actual food choices.\n\n3.) To solve this logic problem, the \"each person gets an equal amount of each dessert\" restriction should be reevaluated.\n\n4.) If we know that there is a lot more food than people, and each person gets an equal amount, then the number of possible desert choices for the whole group should only be 34 (7*42+63+21).\n\n5.) Then, if we know the number of possible desert options (n) and the number of people (k), the \"divide equally\" statement can be rewritten with the formula: n/k = (42+63)/7.\n\n6.)

Weight of the ladder per foot = 8 pounds. Multiply by the number of feet high to obtain total weight. 144 sqft x 8 pounds per foot = 1152 pounds.\nWe know this is wrong.

And that is why is assumes that 152 lbs to be the correct answer. But if one is using their math intuition, 152 lb for this problem doesn't work.

Note that we do not know the number of people that were taken on the first trip from city A or the number of people that the bus that carried on the second trip from city B so we can consider them as xn and xd respectively.\n4- The equation expressing the capacity of 20 people in the bus is:\n\nCapacity = 200n+xn\n\n5- The equation expressing that 200 was taken on the bus from city A is:\n\n(n-xd)+xn=200\n\n6- The equation expressing 160 was taken on the same bus from city B is:\n\nxn+xn+xd = 160\n\n7- The total number of people that was taken on the bus for a given trip is 200.

{"text": "1. We know that Harry's books are 50, but we are not given specifics about the books owned by Flora and Gary. In order to solve this question, we need to break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces.\n2. We know that the number of books owned by Flora is twice the number of books owned Harry because she owns more than him. For simplicity sake we can assume that Flora's number of books is 2x50, so it is 100.\n3. Likewise, we know that Gary's number of books equals \u00bd the number of books Harry owns because he owns less than Harry. For simplicity sake we assume that Gary owns \u00bd of the total number of books owned by Harry.\n4. The question is asking about the number of combined books owned by Harry, Flora, and Gary.  So, we cannot apply the simple division operation of dividing the total number of books by the number of people.  Rather, we need to find another method to solve the problem.\n5. Let's look at Harry's library. If we add the number of books owned each individual and divide that number by the total number of books, we can understand the number of books that each person owns in the Harry's library.\n6. Harry owns a total of 50 books. If we subtract the 50 from this total, then we have 0 remaining.\n7. If we add this 0 to Flora's total of 100, we will obtain the total number of books in the Harry's Library. Therefore, the total number of books for Harry and Flora's library will be 150.\n8. Similarly, to find the number of books in the library owned by Harry and Gary, we start by finding the number of books owned in Flora's library. Then, we subtract that number from the total number of books. Finally, we add the resulting remainder to the 50 to determine the number of books owned between Harry and Gary. \n9. Therefore, Harry owns 50 books, Flora owns 150, and Gary owns 70 books total in the libraries of the three of them.\n10.

The question indicates that renting a cottague for eight hours costs $40, so the cost per hour is 5.\n2. If we multiply 5 by 4, we get 20. This is the cost of renting the cottagge per total number of hours (8 in this case).\n3. We then need to determine how much each friend pays for the cottage. The question indicates that Jack and Jill share the cost of renting it, so each friend pays half the total cost.\n4. If we multiply 20 by 1/2, we get 10, which is how much Jack and Jill each pay for the cottage in total.\n5. To determine how much each friend paid individually for the cottage, we need to divide 10 by the number of hours they rented the cottage. If Jack rents it for 4 hours, he will pay $1/hour, or 1 for 4 hours = 3.\n6. If Jill rents it for 5 hours, she will pay $1/hr as well, or 1 for five hours = 5.\n7.

{"text": "1) First, we need to determine how many imported bottles were used in the party.\n2) To figure out which bottles are imported or not we can use our assumption \"half as many bottles of domestics wine as imports\". Which means \"half as many imports\" means that half of the imports and half of the domestics were used.\n3) Therefore 1200 bottles were imported and 600 were domestic.\n4) Now let's assume each was served on average. We have 600 bottles of domestic wine per party, times 14 servings = 8400 servings. Total servings = 9600. So each bottle had 14 servings.\n5) Now we know that each bottle had 9600 servings so we can calculate the remaining bottles.\n6) So there are 400 bottles left of imported wine and half of it is 200 bottles left. \n7) So the total imported bottles left is 2400 + 200 = 2600 bottles left!\n\nInput: 1 2 6 4 5 10 15........................................................... 399  Output: 2.

Choices: A: Both 72cm B: Both 72m C: Perimeter only 0m D: Circumference only 0m E: Perimeter only 72cm\nOutput:\n1. The perimeter and the circumferene of a circle are both lengths that describe the circle:\n2. Let's define the distance around the circle as the circumference, C, and the line/wall of the circle as the perimeter, P.\n3. The perimeter of the circle has a length of 2*2\u03c0r, where \u03c0r is the circumference of the circle.\n4. So, the perimeter is not 72cm but instead 2*2\u03c0*72.\n5. Now, look at the lengths available to us as options:\nOption A, B, and E say that the perimeter is 72cm or m.

If she sold all the bikes at the lowest price, what would she earn?\nOutput: \n1. The question asks Lenny how much money she earned by selling the bikes in 3 different ways.\n2. We find the lowest price the bikes can be sold at and use that price to find how much money she earns if she sells all 3 bikes at that lowest-priced point;\n3. We know that 3 bikes can be sold for $1,200, one for $400, two for $500, or all three for $1500;\n4. We subtract $26,000 from $25,999 to obtain a value of $1, which is how much money Lenny earned, if she sold all the bicycles at the lowest priced point in accordance with the sale;\n5. We subtract $1500 from $27,000 to find that if she sold two bikes, Lenny would earn $15,600.\n6. We subtract $400 from $26,800 to find that she would lose over $12200 if she sold one bicycle.\n7. The last question asks how much money Lenny would earn if she sold all the remaining bicycles at their lowest price.

Since there has to be half as many blue candys as yellow candys, but we're told that there's 60 total yellow and 50 total blue, we can determine that there has to be 30 total blue.  This would then leave 30 blue candies, 30 yellow candyes, and we're told that Carlos eats all the yellow candies so theres only 10 remaining red candys.  And since each red candies equals three yellow candies, theres 30 yellow candies.  And since there's only 10 remaining, theres 8 remaining.  And since there are 10 red candies, theres also 8 remaining red candies.  Since each red candies equals a yellow candys, there must be 24 remaining yellow candies and 24 remaining blue candys.

Therefore, we can't accurately determine the number of people currently on the bus. 3- Even if we knew exactly what number of people got on or off at each stop, it would not be possible to figure out the number of people currently riding the bus. 4- There is no mathematical or algebraic equation that we can use to derive the number of people currently aboard the bus. 5- This question is not meant to test for an explicit understanding of complex mathematical concepts, but rather a general mathematical and problem-solving skill. 6- It's possible that some students may know how to get this answer without a calculator, which might make it appear difficult. 7- A common misconception is to look at the answer choices, which are clearly wrong, and then think that they couldn't possibly be correct because they don't make sense. However, they might be the correct answer for a different, but related, question.  8- The answer might be confusing because it is technically correct, but it doesn'\u200bt make sense in the context of the question.

To determine the total we know we need to use multiplication so let's multiply the number of bathroom sets (2&4) by how many bath towels each set contains (4&6 respectively) so there are (2 x 4 + 4 x 6)towel sets.\nTo add onto that, the question states that 1 set from the guest bath would cost $40.0 and that the bath towel sets are $50.0. Thus meaning there are (2 x $40.0 + 4 x $50.0)sets available for both towel sets. However, we don't buy the complete sets. We buy them 20% off or simply divide the sets by two. So (100, 2x40) becomes (50, 2x20). So in total, Bailey needs to spend $... on towel sets.", "answer": " 224"}

Choices:  A. down B. outside C. off D. away\nOutput: \n1. There is no opposite of \"up\", because \"up\" can be used to describe \"something that is on a raised position\". \"up\" refers to \"somewhere or something higher than another object or position\". \n2. \"Down\" means \"toward or in a lower position\". So, \"down\" cannot be a synonym of \"up\".\n3. \"Outside\" refers to \"someplace that is outside an indoor area\". That does not give a meaning associated with a raised position. Therefore, this option is incorrect.\n4. \"Off\" is not an antonym of \"up\" because \"off\" \"means to remove a person or thing from some place\" (Merriam-Webster).\n5. \"Away\" means \"to be separated from some place or person\". It should have the meaning exactly opposite to \"up\". But it should not have the description of \"on position or higher position\". So, this option is incorrect too.\n6.

In total, for each minute that it takes to fill the pool, the height of the pool will increase by 1.6*60 gallons.  If it takes 1 minute to fill the pool, it will contain 60 more gallons and thus be 60 gallons taller.  It would then require 2*60 gallons to add an additional height of 120gallons.

The same would be true if we replaced \"Monday\" with any of the days in the previous sentences (e.g., on Tuesday he had 34 baseball cards, on Wednesday he had 35 baseball cards, and on Thursday he had 31 baseball cards).\n8) Therefore, if we compare Thursday to Monday, we see that the number of baseball cards increased by 1 or 12.

{"text": "1) This is a multi-step math problem. 2) The formula for this problem is: P = A / (sum of all products of A and the quantity) 3) We set up our problem with an equation using an algebraic version of \"farmer\". 4) Next, we solve by determining the value of the total water used for any given farmer. 5) Since each farmer is growing a different type of crop, all we need to do is to determine the total water used in each kind of crop. 6) We multiply the water used by each crop with the quantity used to determine the total water to each kind of crop used. 7) We then subtract the corn from the cotton and subtract the cotton from the beans, to get the total water used for each farmer. 8) Once you know the total water used for this farmer and the percentage used for corn, you can determine the percentage used for Farmer Bob's corn crop. 9) Since Farmer Bob's crop takes up the same amount of space, and uses the same amount of total water, as Farmer Brenda's cotton crop, then the percentage used by her to grow cotton should be equal to the percentage used by Farmer Bob.  \n10) We get that the cotton crop percentage for Farmer Brenda = (20 / BW) = (20 / (C + 42)) = \\((20/54)) * (100)/(100/54) = 36\\% 11) Similarly, the total water for Farmer Bernie's crop (beans) is 9 times as much as the total water for Farner Bob's crop (corn) - (9 x 2) = 18 gallons 12) Because the total water uses the same number of gallons as the total number of Corn acres (C) (108), the percentage of water used to grow corn for this farmer is: Corn percentage = (18 / 108) * 100 = 17\\%.\nSo the final result is that farmer Bob uses 25% (36/136) of the water, with farmers Brenda and Bernie using 15% (36 / 2", "answer": " 36"}

For example, if Stu has 9 books, then Albert has 4X= 36 books.\n3) If Stu has 9 books in total, then Albert has 36 books in total.\n4) If Albert has 36 in total, then Stu has 9 in total.\n5) The only numbers that remain after substitution are 36 and 9.\n6) Therefore, the answer is 36 + 9 = 45.

{"text": "1 Average Time per km (round to 2 decimals): 6.5, is the answer of TJ.\n2. To figure out what TJ\u2019s average per kilometer was, we need to know the times for the 2 halves of the race. We know TJ ran the first half in about 20 minutes (give or take).\n3. Because the half marathon is about 10K, TJ will have run 5K in the first half. So, we already know that he ran a little over 5K in 20 minutes (or, for the sake of calculation, call it 20 min).\n4. To figure out how long it took TJ to run the second half, we can subtract how long it took him to run the first half. The second half of the race was 30 minutes.\n5.

The sentence gives us the details we need to answer the question: we know how long it takes to wash each type of item, and we know the total number of items.\n3. Let's start by determining the total number of items Naomi wants to wash. It looks like she has three separate piles - towels, clothes and sheets. The question doesn't ask for the amounts, it doesn't tell us to exclude any items from the totals, so we can assume she's going to wash all three piles.\n4. In order to arrive at the total time, we will first calculate the wash times for each item separately.\n5. Since the question is asking for wash times, not for the time it will take Naomi to complete the wash, we will calculate the wash time for all three piles separately.\n6.

The monthly midpoints of May through July are May 15, June 16, and July 16. 2)To answer the question you need to apply the formula for geometric progression. Given that the deepest point at mid-July is 3 times deeper than a mid-June which is 10 ft deeper than a mid-May 5-ft deep, the formula for geometric progresion tells us that the depth at mid-July (the next mid-point) would be 15-ft.\n3)The original question asked about the July river depth in comparison to the May River depth (5f). Because we are now speaking of depth, \"feet\" was substituted in the response.  4)We are now told that the mid-May depth is 5 feet deep. We know mid-June is 10 feet and mid-July 15 feet. To find the May, we subtract May depth (5) from mid-June (10) to get 5-5=0. The formula for the mid-point does not subtract. Therefore, knowing that the mid-July depth is 15 feet, we subtract 15-mid-June=10 which is then subtracted from the current mid-May=5.

This job is not a private enterprise. Whoever you are, I want you to get off my back!\nOutput: I work for the government. What type of worker are you?\n1. The sentence states that the job of the person working for the government is a job in a government organization.\n2. If it was a private enterprise, the person would not work for the government but for a private enterprise.\n3. Therefore, in what type of job the speaker is engaged is not a private business and that is what he/she wants to express.\n4. The person wants the speaker to leave him/her alone, i.e., stop talking, stop bothering, or stop pressuring him/her.\n5. The sentence also points to the fact that the sender works for the government. The speaker could be someone who is not satisfied with the activities of the sender, i.e., this job is a public enterprise or this job is a private business\n6.

[The word inclusive in this question refers to an element that is a part of a range rather than a separate entity, and the word exclusive denotes the opposite of inclusive. This means that while John worked a total of 40 hours, the 3 rd day did not count towards that total. Likewise, the 8 th day was not included in the total.]\n3) To answer this question, we need to calculate the number of hours worked without the 3 rd as well as the 8 th.\n4) The 3 rd was counted, so we can subtract 1 from the number of hours worked. Similarly, the 8 th was not counted, so we can add one to the number of hours worked\n5) The work schedule included a total of 6 days, so we can substract 6 from the total number of days, giving us 40-6-1=33.\n6) Finally, we can subtract 8 from the total number of hours (240-8=232), leaving us with the answer A: 232.\nSo the final anwser is A\n\nInput: What's my age?

Jim, in turn, sells 50% fewer apples than Steve. In this situation, we can write the % difference equation. Steve (original amount of apples) - Jim (% difference Steve experienced) = John (% difference Jim experienced) - John (% difference Steve experienced). Now we can simplify this to Steve / Steve * Jim (% difference Steve experience) = (Jim / Jim * Steve (% difference Steve experience)). Steve (original amount of 0 apples) / Steve * Jim (5% difference Jim experience) = (Jimi (60% difference Jim experience) apples, as 50% / 60% = 5% difference Jim experienced.\nOutput:1.The question is asking us to simplify an expression. Since we're working with percentages of apples, we can't divide by 0, so our first step is to divide both sides of the equation by Steve.\n2. We're left with Steve / (Steve * Jim) = (Jim) / (Jim * Steve). This equation is more difficult to simplify than the first because we need to raise both sides of the equation to the power of 1 / Jim.\n3. However, since we know Jim sold 50% fewer than Steve, we can rewrite the equation as follows: Steve / (Steve x Jim) = (JIm) / (Jim x Steve), which is more manageable for simplification.\n\n4. After raising both sides to the power of 5/Jim, we're left with Steve = (Jim x Steve) / (Jim). By dividing both sides of the equation and diving both sides by Steve one more time, we get the simplified answer Jim x Steve / Jim = Jim x Steve.\n\n5", "answer": " 250"}

So we can write 810 = (65+20)*x where x is the number of minutes it will take Mike to type the document and we're trying to solve x for the value inside the parentheses\n\nSince we know Mike originally could type 65 WPH, we can use the formulas:  WPH = CP WPM (where WPH is words per hour and CP is the conversion factor). WPM = WPH / HR (where WPM is the conversion factor and HR is Hourly Rate).\nHR = (1hr./60min)/65\nHR = 3024/65\n\nHR = 47\n\nNow we can write 808 = (65+47)x where x is the hours it took Mike to type the document.\n\nIf we solve for x, we get that it took Mike 25.07 * HR = 113.2 minutes to type the document.

The given information in the problem includes: how far Yolanda travels and her average speed. The husband's speed wasn't given, but we can assume it's constant.\n4. Because the routes are the same, we can use the \"travel distance\" formula, d=(1/2)a*t^2 to determine how much time it takes to travel the distance that Yolanda has traveled. When d=1 hour, that gives us t = (1 hour)/(2 mph) = 30 min. That's how long it takes for Yolanda to complete her trip.\n5. Next, we need to determine if her husband reached her during the trip by using the formula: time-time = distance / speed. We get 30 min-30 min = 6 min.\n6. We still need to find the time in which they meet. In Yolanda's time (in route 1), her husband didn't start his journey right away. It took him 15 minutes before he started to chase after her. \n7. Time 2 represents the total time it took him to drive until he caught up to her. The formula to calculate this time is: Total time (T2) = d/s + t1\n8. Total time (T2), in Yolanda's route, is equal to 30 + 6 = 36 min. \n9. Since their routes are the same, if her husband catches up to her in T2, he catches up to her when she's done traveling.\n10. We still have to determine the exact distance he has to travel from when he leaves. The distance he has to travel is equal to how far she drove + how far she drove before the husband caught up to her, expressed in the equation: Total distance (D) = d1 + d2 where d2 = d + d1\n11.

{"text": "1st step: 12 pages = x\nThe first step is to determine how many pages Tom can read in an hour, which we know is equal to 12 pages.\n2nd step: The second step is to factor the speed by a multiple of 3, which we know means he will be able to read more pages in a shorter amount of time.\n3rd step: This final step is to solve for the new reading speed, which is equal to 24 pages per hour. We can do this by simplifying the equation, by removing the denominator and multiplying both sides by 3, which gives us x = (24 pages per hour) x 4 = 96 pages per hour \nSo the final answer should be (with a different formatting, not necessary): 96 pages per Hour\n\nInput: Which word in the following words is an example of a palindrome? Choices: 1) love 2) read 3) race 4) table 5) palindromes\nOutput: 1) Choose \"love\" - this is a word which reads the same forward as it does backward. You can try this with a few of the other options, and they'll be the same, so you can eliminate all of them.\n2) \"Read\" - This is a reading from left to right, and not a palindrome.\n3) \"Race\" - A race is a competition from a start line to the finish line, and does not read any particular way upon being reversed.\n4) \"Table\" - This is not a letter but a word which is not a word which reads the way you expected when reversing the letters.\n5) \"Palindromes\" - This is not the same as using a palindrome. \"Palindromes\", and palindromes for that matter, are words that read the same backward as they do forward. However, there are lots of words that are palindromes, but do not start out as palindromes, which is the case for the word palindromes itself, which starts out as \"palindromes\".\n\nSo the final answer and this one is Love!", "answer": " 72"}

Next, we need to determine the total number correct in each round, which is done by multiplying the total points in each round by the number of correct answers per round which is 2x2 = 4 for easy, 3x2 =6 for moderate, 5x3 =15 for the hard\n3. We need to evaluate the points for each round and add them up, which is 4+6+15 for 3 rounds.\n4. The next step is to determine the number of correct answers in each round.\n5.

The answer to the question would be 31,40 if we break it down into days and then nuts.\n7. \"All\" for \"30 days\" and \"all\" for \"40 days\" means \"no nuts were left untouched by any squirrel\".\n8. We see that the squirrels (2 busy squirrel) + (1 sleepy squirrel) = (3 busy squirrels + 1 sleepy squirrils).\n9. \"How many\" would then be 31 squirrels, as we saw there were \"all\" squirrels in the car and \"all\" for each type (busy and sleepy).\nSo the final answer would be 31 squigrls.\n\nInput: Is the number of apples one eats for dinner a single event?

Things had gotten a bit sad.  And then my friend came around and everything suddenly became so much better!\nOutput:1) \"Things had gotten a bit\" is the present perfect continuous tense. The simple past tense is called the preterite. 2) When there's an adverb between the auxiliary verb and the main verb, this is called a progressive. 3) The progressive is formed by adding -ing to the verb with an auxiliary verb (i.e. in this case was), so \"Things were getting\" rather than \"Things get\" is the correct phrasing.    \n4) The past participle is \"gotten\", which means you use the verb form we use for an \"ing\" in the past tense. \nSo the correct phrasing here is \"Things were getting a bit sad.\"\n5)  When an adjective comes after the verb \"is\", it is necessary to place the adjective before the noun: \"My friend\" rather than \"My friend is\"\n6) The verb \"have\" can be used as a synonym for \"get\" in certain contexts, but in this case you would use \"had\" rather than \"have\".\nSo the correct answer is \"Things had been getting a bit sad\" rather than \"My happiness had been getting bit sad.\"\nSo the final answer will be D: Things had been getting a bit sa\n\nInput:He's got a lot of time on his hands.

To get to the total amount of strawberries they used to make jam, we have to add in Natalie's: 36 + 16 = 52.\n8. Since Matthew picked 3 strawberries more per jar of jam, each of his added 3 strawberis to each jar.\n9. This means each jar of jam received 10 more strawberies from Matthew and 1 more strawberry from Natalie.\n10. Each jar of jam required a total of 17 strawberies, so Matthew used 20 - 17 = 3 extra strawberries per jar of jam on average.\n11. Matthew's jars of jam consumed 52 - 17 =35 strawberries, so Matthew used on average 3 strawberies more per jar than Natalie.\n12. The jars of jam used 7/17/3 = 4.2 strawberries per pot.\n13. So to make one pot of jam, Matthew used 3 strawbery more than Natalie. We can now multiply 3 by 4.2 and find that for each pot of jam made, they used Matthew's 12.6 extra strawberries.

The question asks how many times Jason goes to the library in 1 week.\n3. William goes to the library twice per week.\n\n4. We are given that each of the 4 weeks of the month has a total of 2 weeks, so 4 weeks is equal to 2 * 2 = 4 weeks.\n5. So, from the given information, we know that Jason goes to the Library 4 times in 4 weeks.\n6. There are 7 days in a week so 4 times in 1 week means that Jason goes to theLibrary 4 /7 = 0.57 times in a week.\n7. So, Jason goes to the Library approximately 4 times in the first week and 0.55 times in every other week.\n8. In 4 weeks, Jason goes to theLibrary approximately 4/4 = 1 times.\n9.

Let's take a look at $60 and $30 prices for large and small paintings respectively.\n4. Since $560 is for 4xlarge and 8xsmall paintings, the new month's paint will be for: 4x$60 + $30/xlarge + $30/xsll: \n    This means that this month he'll make $1000.", "answer": " 1200"}
{"text": "2. The question is asking how many of the 60 Grade 5 students in the class overall got a final grade of at least B if 40% of those students got a final grade that was less than B.\n3.We can use the percentages given to solve this question using a table.\n4. A common way to solve these percentage calculations is to draw a table so that we can organize the given percentages into the values we know, and in the case of this question, we know how many students in each grade, the percentage of each grade, and the final grade of each grade.\n5. First, we need to organize the information and decide what information each column will be labeled. In this case, it might be best to label the first column with the grade names (0 - 10), the second with the percentage of students in each grade, and then the third with the number or percentage (including decimal values) of students in each of the grades.\n6. The percentage of students who got a final grade of A or above is 60%, so we note next to that number that 60% of 60 students = 36 students.\n7. We can continue to do that same calculation for the next percentage, which is 40%, and 40% of 66 students = 26 students.\n8. Finally, the percentage of students who got the grade of B or higher is 45%, so we note next the 45% of 60 which would be 27 students.\n9. Therefore, the correct answer is 36 + 26 + 27 = 89 students.\nSo the final number of students in the class that got a final grade A or better is 89.\n\nInput: What should you wear? Choices: 1.

We know that the total number of flowers is 155, but we need to find the number of roses.\n5. To do so, we subtract 25 from 155 and get 130. \n6. So that is the number of roses in the garden.\n7. Next, we just subtract from the total again, but this time we subtract 25 rather than 130 because that's the number of roses that are present.\n8. We find that there are 25-25 = 0 roses in the garden (remember we subtracted the number of roses here to avoid subtracting 130 from 155, so we don't get off by 10!).\n9. Then, we divide 25 by 155.

The car is lacking tires, windows, & a radiator.\n2. We haven't been given any context clues beyond what the word choices suggest.\n3. All the given nouns are abstract terms.\n4. The given phrases, \"was missing\", \"tires\", \"windows\" and \"radiator\" all include abstract terms indicating the car is missing these parts and the phrases \"missing\" implies that they are all important enough to be mentioned separately.\n5. The most accurate and best way to phrase this sentence is \"missing tires, windows, a radiator\"\n6. If we simply left it as given, \"The car was missing tires windows and a radiator,\" it is implying that they are lacking tires, not tires and a radiator. The use of \"and\" between the windows and radiator means tires and windows are missing. It doesn't say which two objects are actually missing. Tires and a radiator aren't mentioned in the same list. If a word is missing between tires and windows, that means they are all missing and it implies they are each separate nouns.\n7.

This means that Mitchell had read all ten chapters before 4 pm.\n2) After 4 o' clock she read more than 30 chapters. Notice that 20 + 2 = 22 pages of one chapter. If she reads 1 more chapter, that means 1+ 20 = 21 pages, 20 + 4 = 24 pages, 20 x 2 = 40 pages. These all will equal the no. of pages she read.

If 622 contestants entered a certain race, how many total blue ribbons were awarded?\nOutput: \n1. In this question, we don't see the actual count of contestants. We only see a number of contestants and the percentage of contestants with blue ribbons. This indicates that the number of contestants and blue ribbons are not given as quantities but rather as percentages.\n2. We know that among 622 contesters 10% received a blue ribbon. This means that 62 contesters or 10% of 622 contesting receive the blue ribbons.\n3. It would mean that all of the 62 contesters who get the blue ribbon should be selected first.\n\nOutput: In this case, there would be 610 contestants.\n4. Now, the question is asking us to determine the number of total blue ribbons. One thing to note here is that we cannot use the number of blue ribbons on each contestant. Rather, we need to find the number of total ribbons awarded.\n5. This is because, among the 622 contestant, only 10% of them received a blue ribbon, so it is not possible that each contestant received more than one blue ribbon for themselves.\n6. Thus, 10%*622 = 62 ribbons total. Now, let's see the actual amount of blue ribbons. We have to divide the total blue ribbons into all participating contestants to get the number that each contestant received.\n7. The answer is clearly given by the last question, 622 contest, and that 10% are given blue ribbons, which is equal", "answer": " 45"}

We need to understand the speed of the car before and after it travels downhill, in order to determine Conner\u2019  overall average speed. \n4. According to the question, we can assume that:Conner rides his dunebuggy \u2153 part of the time on flat land,1/3 uphill, and \u2153 downhill.\n5. We can simplify the question by writing a mathematical statement. \n6. Let\u2019s use the symbol r to denote traveling on flat sand. \n7. To begin, we need to determine the traveling speed of Conner\u2019s dune buggy when riding on flat terrain.\n8. We can determine this speed by multiplying the speed of his buggy when it\u2019s on flat land by the fractional part of time he spends on flat sand.\n9. To find this speed in the mathematical expression:  r = 60/(1/3)\n10. The resulting speed for the buggy on flat sand is 80 miles per hour.\n11. Now we need to know the speed when in motion on uphill sloped.\n12. We can determine this value by simply subtracting 80 with 60.  The resulting speed is 20 miles per hour. Now we need to find the speed when on a downward slope.\n13. To determine the speed of the car on downhill, we take the existing traveling speed (20 miles per hour) and raise it to the power of (1/2). \n14. The resulting speed is 166 miles per hour.  Now that we know the buggy\u2019s traveling speed on downslope, we can calculate its average  speed.\n\n15. To get the average speed, we simply multiply the traveling speed of the car traveling on downslope by how long Conner\u2019s dunge buggy travels on downhill.\n\n16.

When Benny spent $28, he spent $4 on 2 soft drinks and $24 on 5 candy bars, so Benny's total spending is $28.\n2. If each soft drink costs $4 and each candy bar costs $5, the total cost of Benny's candy bars is $28 and the total cost of Benney's soft drinks is $8.\n3. Therefore, for every candy bar Benny buys he spends $5 and for every soft drink Benny buys he pays $2.\n4. Benny bought 5 candy bars and 2 soft drinks, meaning each candy bar cost $5 and each soft drink cost $2. 5.

{"text": "The problem description tells us that Jessica's cost for rent increased by a certain rate, her food cost increased by a certain rate and the cost of her insurance increased by some amount.\n5. Let's start with car insurance. We can take the two values $100 and $300, and divide them by the rate of increase, $300 30%, which gives us a new total of $1000.\n6. However, we can't assume that $300 was the entire cost of insurance last year. To fix that, we need to multiply the remaining $200 ($200 x 1.65) from last year. We don't have to worry about what happens to the rest of the food because we still have $200 after dividing by 50%.\n7. So the entire problem is simplified to $700 rent, $700 insurance (last years rate) + $1000 insurance (this year rate) + $200 (1.5) food.\n8. Rent went up 30%. But that percentage is based on the original amount. Instead, we need to divide the remaining cost (before the increase) ($600) by the pre-increase rate (10%). This gives us a new total increase of $50.\n9. So, the final total is $700 + $50 + $200 = $1,450.

{"text": "1)The problem begins with Frank's statement, \"I go buy peanuts, it cost...\". This prompts a solution that involves the addition of Frank's \"peanut bill\" and then dividing this value by the number of days in the week.\n2)Since we know there are five days in a typical work week, this means there are six days after which Frank has leftover peanuts, or, in other words, more than he needs for each of the six days.   \n3)Because of this, there is no reason to include the bill for the sixth day. Thus, we begin by assuming that the $13.40 bill ($6.40 at 2.25/lb.) is for the first day, and then we can assume that the remaining bill of $4.10 ($2.25/2.25 = 1.00) is for the sixth day and that these amounts are evenly distributed over each of those six days.   \n4)Frank's peanut bill is, therefore, $8.95 per day, which equals:\n(6/7 of 1+ $4.10)/(6/7) = $8.95   \n 5)The original problem statement begins with the following: \"He goes to buy peanut... Then, it reads, \"He buys what he wants... This implies that Frank is buying peanuts in quantities sufficient to satisfy his needs.   \n 6)Thus, we can calculate how many pounds the math problem is asking about by first determining how many bills Frank has left and how much each bill is worth. (The original problem indicates that Frank has 4 five-dollars bills remaining). Then, we determine the number of pounds Frank can buy per dollar by multiplying the number of left five-dollar bils by 0.5.   \n 7)This works out to 4 X 0.5 = 2 pounds.

{"text": "1. The key word in this question is \"remaining.\" We are looking at the number of calories present in an entire serving of cheese, and Rick has already eaten five complete servings.\n2. There are 1100 calories in a whole 16-serving block, so we can eliminate A, D, E: They do not fit this pattern.\n3. To find the amount of calories remaining, we multiply the number of servings - in this case, 16 - by the number of calories in a single serving.\n4. However, a whole block costs less than 16 single-serving blocks, so once you have eaten five of these servings, you have gone past what it costs for you to buy.\n5. In this case, the amount of calories in the unused cheese plus the amount already eaten is 0.  Therefore, the number of calories remaining is 0 (0 servings * 16 servings = 0).\n6. Hence, the answer is C: 0.\nSo the final answers are C and D. The answer to the puzzle and the last number is 0 (0 * 16).\n\nInput: Which of the following is a word that begins with's'?

To find the unknown, we need to substitute known values into the unknown variable, which in this case is c (because c is directly proportional to b).\n4. Since we know that b = 2c and c = 4 + c, then 2c = 4 + c. Thus, 4 = 2c.\n5. Therefore, 2c = 6, which means that c = 3.\n6.

Choices:  Color:  A: orange B: pink C: brown D: violet E: yellow\n\nOutput: The color brown is the fifth color in our rainbow. Why?\n\nAnswer: We are asked which of 5 colors, but the answer has nothing to do with colors. It has to do with how those colors compare to 5.\n\nColor is a 1st class concept because it is inherent to a number. Therefore, it is always more than you'd expect.\n\nSo \"5\" is in the middle, making Orange and Violet on either side of it.\n\nThus 5th element always comes in the middle of a set.\n\nInput: 2 is not 3.

{"text": "1) To answer the question, we need to determine how long it takes Tony to assemble one widget.\n2) The statement that Sam works 1 per 10-minute workload can be re-written as 1 widget/10 min workload, or 1 widget per 100 minute workload, or just 1 widget per 600 seconds work load.\n3) Because of the statement that Jack works 2x as fast as Sam, this tells us it takes Sam's 1-min per widget, plus 100% of Jack's per minute workload, or 2 of Sam's one-widgets per minute x 600 seconds.\n4) Tony will then have to do the remaining 4 widgets of the 68 total widgets that were assembled yesterday minus the 60 widgets Sam and Jack each accounted for.\n5) So, for Tony's contribution, the amount by which it takes to create 1 widget takes 60% of his work-load.\n6) From this, we can compute that the amount of of the hour remaining for Tony to work is equal to 68 widgets x 4 hours, or 272 widgets to match our widget completion statement.\n7) Finally, since each widget takes 1 minute to complete, you have to compute how many seconds Tony has for each widget, and we then times this by 60 (seconds) per minute to arrive at the 9,432 second workload for this task.\n6. So, Tony will have to put together 9,433 widgets per hour to complete his workload of 68. This makes Tony's workload of 9,434 widgets per minute, and that 9,435 widgets per second.\n\nThus, the solution is D: 68 total Widgets at 1:00 per second, which works out to be 0.387 seconds per widget, which is exactly correct.\nSo the final correct answer is D and the time Tony needs to put out 68 widgets is approximately 0.38s\n\nInput: Your car is in the garage.

{"text": "1) The question asks us to calculate the average age of Omi, Arlette, and Kimiko.\n2) Omi is twice as old, so she is 2 times older than Kimiko.  So the average of Omi and Kimiko is twice Kimiko.\n3) Arlette is 3 times as old as Kimko. Let a = Arlette's age. 3/4a = Arlette's ages. 3/4 * 28 = 17. Therefore, Arlette is 17 years old. So, Arlette + Kimiko's average is 3 * (2 times older than Kimoko) + 2 times older than Kiimoko = 7 times older than Kimiko (because we are squaring Kimiko). Average age = 9 x 2/7 - Kimiko's average age.\n4) Average age of 2 - Kimiko is 33.\n5) There are no options between 9, so 9 is the average age between 2 and 10.\n6) 9/2 + 9/10 =9/3 = 3\n\nSo the final answer would be 3\n\nInput: How many candles do I need to buy for Christmas?

This means that each grandchild has 8 grandchildren, i.e. 16 total, and so 8 = 16.\n9) Therefore, the equation becomes: 8 = 10.

We then need to figure out the cost as a percentage of the price from a year ago and multiply it by the number of lawnmow\nrers to get the answer.\nSince the cost was 2/5 of its current price a year ago, we can reason that it must have been $1200 or $1300 a year ago.

{"text": "1) Given the information in the question, the time interval for which we are analyzing the amount of water leaking is a two-hour period.\n2) First, we need to determine the total amount of water that will be leaking at any point in time. The greatest amount of water that is leaking comes from the large hole. At any given moment, it is leaking at a rate of ounces per minute. To find this amount, we need to multiply the per-minute rate by the number of minutes it takes for two hours. Because we are using a two-hour time interval, there are 720 minutes in total, so we can multiply the rate by 720:\n3 * 720 = 2,160 ounces per minute 4) We can use the formula Q = L ( t ) = L0 * t / T to find the total amount of water leaking, where Q = rate of flow, L0 = rate at which large hole leaks at capacity, t = time period when water is leaking, and T = the total time. We need to plug in the appropriate values. Let's begin as follows:\nQ = L ( t )    = ( 3 * 725 ) * t / 2 or 2,303 ounces\n5) We can now substitute our given variables for Q, L0, T, and t as follows: 6) Q = ( 3 *720 * 2), which indicates the amount of water that is being leaked in ounces. Using the fact that there are 2,304 minutes in two hours (720*2), we can multiply 2,300 by 720. Note that 720*2 = 1440 and 3*724 = 2160, so the answer comes out to 6908916.\n\nInput: How many hours does it take to complete a project, given the following conditions?

To find out how much it costs to buy a table and four chairs, we want to use the ratio to find out how much buying this number of chairs will be compared to buying one, and then multiply by the cost of a table to find out how much it will cost to buy the table and chairs together.\n2. We divide the cost of a table by the cost of a chair = 140/7 = $20, so that's how much it costs to get one chair. \n3. To find out how many chairs it costs to buy a set of five, we use the multiple of 5 we found previously, 7 x 5 = 35, so seven chairs would be $7 x 7 = 49, and five chairs would be 49/7 = 7\n4. To find out how it costs to buy all five together, we multiply the cost of a table and four chases, which we figured out previously is $20\n5. We know the cost of the table is $140, so to get all five chairs and the table we need to multiply the cost of a chair x 7, plus the cost of a table: 7 ($20) x 4 (75) plus 140 = $335.\nSo the final answers are two hundred dollars and thirty-five cents.\n\n*TIP: to find the cost of a table with 4 chairs, one would first find out how much 5 chairs cost.

Understand what the question is asking us to figure out:\n    - The time to travel across the lake (10 minutes)\n    - The speed at which that happens (in miles per hour)\n2. Identify what is important in our equation:\n    - we know the numerator (5 miles)\n    - we know that we must cross it in a time equal to or less than 10 minutes\n3. Recognize that the question wants us to write an equation relating speed with time. We want to find a constant that when multiplied with a speed will give a time less than or equal to 10 minutes.\n4. Evaluating the denominator: 5\n5. Evaluating the numerator: 1\n    - The speed is the unknown that we need to solve for\n    - The variable that we are going to solve for (speed) is used in both numerator and denominator\nSolving the equation - 5/speed < 10\nSolving for the speed\n    - Multiply both the sides by 5/5\n    - The equation will now look like speed < 10/5\n    - Divide both hand sides by 1/10\n    - The equation has a time and a speed, and the unknown speed is inside the numerator.

We have four answer choices that correspond with the five prices in the family, but we must eliminate the incorrect ones.\n3. The first and fifth prices are $50 and $0.1, while the second, third, and fourth prices are $100, $0, and $50.\n4. Since only one of the given prices is $50, we can eliminate options A and D. They're either not the right amount for grandma's ticket or don't correspond with the five specified ticket prices.  \n5. Further, there's no need to put the dollar sign in front of $50 since it's already a price, so we can eliminate option C.  \n6. Option E could conceivably be the answer since the cost of the entire family's tickets is $500 - that amount leaves us with only a couple of dollars left. However, we can confirm by rewriting the family's total cost as 5 \u00d7 $100 + $0 + $50 + $0 = $550, that does not equate to $500.\n7. Therefore the answer is B: $10.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "The question asks how many songs Aisha has.\n1. The number of songs is equal to the sum of the number of songs on her mp3 when she started + the number of songs she added during a specific time period + the number she removed from the MP3.\n\n2. The MP3 starts with 50 songs when she starts adding 500 songs a week.\n3. To find the number of songs after a specific period, we can subtract the number of songs at the beginning from the number she had at the end of that specific period.\n4. Therefore, the total number of songs she had after that specific period is: (500 + (2*500)) - 50 = 3000\n5. Then if we add (500 + 500 + 2*500 + 1000 + 525 = 4500 and subtract 3000 from that, we get 1500 as the final answer.

Since x represents the number of students in a class that do not play basketball or volleyball, this suggests that the class contains 8 students who play both basketball and vollyeball.\n\nThere were originally a total of 20 students who played either basketball or volleybal, so subtract 8 players who play both and there are only 12 remaining who play basketball or volleybal. \n\nSolution: There are 12 students that play basketball or volleyba.

{"text": "1) We want the number of dozen donuts Javier should buy and sell to achieve his goal.\n2) We know that Javier needs to sell each of his donuts for $1 to reach his goal.\n3) Javier buys a dozen, then sells each of those donuts for $1, so he expects to make $12 in total.\n4) Now, we must calculate how much profit each of Javier's donuts will make him to determine how many donuts he should buy and sell.We know Javier sells each donut and that each donut sells for $1. Therefore, Javier spends $2.40 to buy each dozen donuts. We can determine Javier's profit for each dozen donut by subtracting his investment of $2.40 from the expected revenue of $12 (12 times $1 or $12) per dozen. That is:\n\n$12 - $2.40 = $9.60\n\nso each of Javier'a donuts yield a profit of $9.60.\n\n5) Having determined that each of Javier' a dozen donuts yield a profit $9.60, we may now answer the question of how many donuts Javier needs to buy and sell. Javier first needs to be able to break even or yield a net profit of $0 (since he is selling for $1 and buying for $2.4). To satisfy this requirement, Javier needs to sell 12 donuts. However, after that point, Javier sells each additional donut for an additional $9.60 in profit, which means he wants to buy twice as many donuts to account for the extra revenue.To summarize:\n\nTo break even ($0 Profit/$0 Loss)\nJavier needs to sell \n\nBecause each donut yields a $9.60 profit\n\nJavier needs to buy \n\nJavier therefore needs to buy and sell 12 dozen donuts.", "answer": " 10"}

We note that each unicorn moves forward 3 meters with each step, meaning that the total distance they cover is 18 000m, but that the length of the trip is 9 km. This means that they'll move 18 033 meters forward in total.  \n3: Therefore, the number of flowers that will grow in total by the end of the unicorns' journey will be 18033 x 6 = 108 994 949 flowers.\nSo the final score is 108 \u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b994 952\n\nInput: The dog is barking at the mailman. Choices:  A. Dog and mailman are friends B. Dog is barking to get mailman's attention C. The mailman is angry at the dog D. The dog is angry at the mailman E. The dog is happy to see the mailman\nOutput: 1 - The first clue is in the title of the question - \"is.\" This tells us that the answer will be either a present tense verb indicating an action or state of being, or a \"be\" form (the present participle) indicating an action in progress. 2 - In the options, we have a verb (in the past form) indicating an action that was already complete (\"was\" - choice D), a \"being\" form (\"is\" - choice B), and a verb form indicating an action (in the future form - \"shall\" - choice E) and a \"being\" (future) form (present participle - \"living,\" choice A). 3 - The answer will therefore be a verb form indicating an ongoing action (contraction of \"is\" + present participle endings). 4 - Therefore, the answer must be B: \"is.\"\nSo the final answer can be any random number because this has no impact and not the answer is B.\n\nInput: It took them five years to solve the problem.

{"text": "In this question, we have the following data:\n\nAugust 17th\nJosh & Anna were born on the same day (1 year apart)\n August 17th for Josh's wedding (age = 22)\n August 19th for Anna's wedding (same year)\nAnd the following constraints:\n\nThe combined age is exactly 1/5th the age of Josh (22) on the day of their marriage\nThe combined age of Josh and Anna is 84\n\nNote: we ignore Anna's age for a second, and just concentrate on Josh's.\n\nWhat is Josh's age now?\n    \nThe given data and constraints imply that today's (current) date should be: August 17 (birthday of Josh).\nWe want 1/5TH of age on August 17, in relation to some reference year T.  \nHence, 1/5TH X Age on August 17 = 22/5 YEARS. (age is positive, which we're happy with).\n    For example, if T=5 (as given in the puzzle), then 1/5TH (5/5) X 22 = 4 Years (assuming no years between 1945-1990)  \n    \nIf T=6 years, then 1/5 (6/5) X 11 = 3.2 years (we round up to 3 years)\n    If T=7 years, then 1(7/5) X 7 = 4.2 years (we again round up to 5 years)....henceforth.\n\nIf T=7, then Josh turns 22. This implies Anna must be the same age, plus one year, making her age = 23 on the day of their wedding.\nIn the original question, given Josh's current age = 54, this implies that Anna's current age = current age - 7 = 47.\n\nHence the final answer is: 47.  \nSo the final answeris 47", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "1.First, we need to start with what value we will be left with after any costs are paid. From the statements, we can figure out how much money goes toward the trip costs which are $7 times 20 = $140.\n2.We subtract $140 from $70 -$5(20)= $45 - $45 = 0.\n3.We subtract 0 from 50 - (5(18)) = $50 - (90) =-40.\n4.So, we subtract -40 from anything left in the fund by adding the fund, the trip cost and the total contribution in the end.\n5.As a result, we end up with $45", "answer": " 10"}

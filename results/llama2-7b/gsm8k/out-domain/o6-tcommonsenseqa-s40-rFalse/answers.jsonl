The total capacity of 8600 can be divided by 6000, so the capacity divided by this number would be 1.4, which was the answer Stella and Twinkles got when they only worked for the first 4 hours.\n\n### Input :Stella and Twinkles have the capacity to fill a truck at the rate of 600 blocks per hour per worker. They each work a 8 hour shift, for 4 hours at that rate.\n\n### Response : The question says Stella and Twinkes can fill a truck but doesn\u2019t say when. If they are filling 600 blocks an hour each person then the total is going to be 1200 blocks an hour.\n\nThere are 10 hours in a day so 10 x 4 is 40 hours. 40 divided by 1200 is 0.033 and is rounded up to 0.034. It takes 34 hours to fill up a truck.\n\n###Input:Sonny made some dinner for 4 people and he made 3 sandwiches.  7 pieces of broccoli and 2 green beans.  Stella gave away 3 pieces of broccoli to her friends.  The 4 people were able to eat 2 of every food item, and 4 of every fruit. What more did they need?\n\n###Response:\n\nThe question implies that Stella ate 7 broccolis and 2 green beens.  She gave up 3 broccolis which means she only ate 4 broccolis and is hungry for 1 more.  This means she is also hungry for 1 green bean.  The question also implies that Sonny ate 1 sandwich, and he also ate 7 beans and 2 broccoli.  So he went home hungry for 1 bean and 2 broccolis. The table at the end of the question shows that everyone else,  Ate 1 of each type of food which leaves no one hungry for more.", "answer": " 6"}

In some cases, this doesn't always work out the way we want it to. If a person has the same grade as the person next to them, sometimes people aren't sure how to feel. What if no one is happy with the grades. In some cases, if a teacher doesn't assign a grade, they say that a person works on the assignment. Doesn't that seem a bit odd? How can someone work on an assignment and then not get graded with a letter grade. In a class, there needs to be a grade assigned to the assignments. I think that schools need to allow students to try many of their assignments before they grade them. What if a student takes their time on an assignment to do their best work and then gets a bad grade? Don't they also have the right to get back and make changes to the assignment to improve it? In the following story, a student named John only gave a perFunctory examination of a corpse, though he was supposed to examine the body more thoroughly. The teacher was disappointed and gave John the lowest possible grade on the assignment. John thought that he would be able to come back and complete the assignment and then the teacher would notice that he had tried to improve it but that didn't happen. This is a common occurrence in many classrooms. It would have been better if John could have come back to the assignment and tried to improve when something seemed wrong. In this example of the task below, John should have been more careful in examining the corpse.\n\n### Detailed response 2: What grade math question can you answer?\n\nIf you think there is something you can add to this discussion, then you should respond to it in a comment.\n\nThank you for completing this assignment.\n\n### Grade for assignment: 61", "answer": " 4"}

What percent bought pizza?\n\n### Demo:\n```JavaScript\nfunction guess () {\n  console.log(\"Guesstimate the percentage of pizza sold in the population of 117 people:\")\n  const guessed = parseInt(prompt(\"Please input a value...\"));\n  let ratio = parseFloat(prompt(\"Please enter the value of pizzas sold divided by the total sold...\")) / 100;\n  if (guessed + 2 * ratio < 29) {\n    console.log(`You over-estimated, guess again...`);\n    guess();\n  }\n  if (guess+3 * ratio > 100) {\n    console\n    console.log(\"You under estimated, guess again...\")\n    guess();\n\n  }\n}\n\nguess();\n```\n\n###  Explanation: The correct answer does not just give the number of pizzas bought, but also gives the percentage of people who bought the pizza.  In the answer, they give 29% of people bought pizza, which means 71% other people did not. 29% of 117 is 34.73. 100-71 is 29. So the ration is 34.9/71.6\n\n### Hint: the given number of pizzas sold can be calculated by taking the total number of pizzas x the percentage of people buying pizza divided by 100.  But to get the percentage, you subtract.6, or 60%, which is the opposite of 39%.", "answer": " 2000"}

{"text": "$64$ 4\n\n### Explanation:\nInput:A compound is some kind of apartment, or group of apartment buildings, together. The population of each building will add up to the overall population of the whole compound. We are given: There are 9 cats and 6 dogs in a compound; we know the population of each building in the compound and are asked to calculate the total population for all of the buildings.  The population of a group of buildings can be expressed in this formula: N(N-1)/2 + X, where N is the number of buildings and X is the number of different residents among the buildings.  We want to know the total number of animals in the building, given the number of frogs.  The formula above is: The total number of buildings is equal to: $100 \\over 10$ $\\times 160$ = $64$\n\n### Demostration\nInput: A compound is some kind apartment or group of apartments. The population of each apartments can be calculated using this formula: N(n \u2013 1) / 2 + X, where X is the number of residents in each building.\n\nIn our example, the total number of cats is one less than the total number of dogs, given in the first part of the problem. Therefore, N(n \u2013 6)/2 + X. This translates to: 2 \u2013 1 = 1. Two cats are less than six dogs, so 2 fewer dogs. 1(n \u20131) = n \u2013 2. X should be 6. 2 + 6 = 8. \n\nIn the second part of the problem, we need to calculate the total animals.  Since we already know the number of animals in each apartment building, the animals can be added together and added to the number of frogs, which is double the number of dogs.  The total number of cats, frogs, and dogs are: $ 8 +160 + 6 = 160 $ frogs, 8 cats, and 6 dogs.\n\n### Exercise:\nInput: Two cats are more than one dog.

But one of the students didn't know which one to choose, so she asked to look at all of them in her hands. When she looked at all of them, she said, \"I chose this book here.\" So the assistant librarian gave the girl the book. Every student filled out an application and then the assistant librarian checked the books. When it got to be late and all the students left, the next day, those books came out and the students had to return them. The books were not checked and weren't being returned. The assistant librarian noticed a girl who was there the day before that did not return a book, so she called her over, and the assistant librarian said, \"I forgot to check you out.

{"text": "### Explain your thinking\n\n### Input 013:\n\n### Step 1 The first thing to do in our computation is to change all of the fractional mangoes from 1/5 to 5/5. So 1/5 turns into 5/5. Why did we do that? This is often a good strategy to apply to problems that involve ratios. We know that 1/5 is written as 1. Which is simpler to compute? The 1 or the 5? In this case 5 is simpler. So we change all of our the fractional to a simple 5.\n\n### Input014:\n\n### Next change our numbers from 400 mangoles to 400. Why change the digits from 1,2,3,etc to 0,1,2,3... etc? Well we know that 400 is a large number, and 1,2,4,8,16,32,etc are also large numbers. It would be a lot easier if we used smaller numbers. 400 x.6 is a lot easier to evaluate than 6x 400 or 6x100.\n\n### Finally, add 400 to the number of ranged mangles as well as to the left side of our fraction. Do you think this approach will work?\n\n### Input Output:\nWe have 327 ripe mangoes.\n\n### Process:\nWe start with 400. We change all of our fractional mangoes to 5/5 and 327 = 400 x.6.", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "He ate five bags of chips.\n\n### Response Explanation:Sometimes in the book you need to convert words to numbers.  The author says, John eats a bag ofchips for dinner and then eat double the amount after dinner.  So we know that John had eaten two bags of chips after dinner.  We can convert from the word bag to the word bags so he's had 2+1=3 bags of chips for dinner, or a total of 5 bags of chips, because he ate twice as much after dinner.\n\n### Input : John had a birthday party and invited his friends from school.  All of them came, and he asked them to leave a box full of cake for him, but the last few just grabbed cake from the table when he wasn't looking.  What type of numbers did he need to figure out?\n\n### Demands 1): How much cake did he have left?\n\n### Answer:12\n\n### Demand 2): What number represents the total amount of cake he had originally?\n\n###  Answer: 45\n\n### Response Demand 2): We know he had a total of 45 cakes originally because we know 45 less 12=33 he had 12.  We know that 33/2= 17, 17 x 2=34, he had 45-17=28 cakes before the party.  So 28(original number) +12(cakes he wanted) is the final number we want.  So we have total 28cakes + 12cakes=40.  So 3x40 = 120, so he had a total of  32=45 in his cake box.\n\n### Output: How many cakes did John have left after the party?\n\n### Output Demand:  He had 12 left.   \n\n### Output Explanation:He had 45 cakes at first, he wanted to subtract 28 cakes,  minus the cakes they ate at the party.

For Example, if the price per month is $50 and total monthly payment is $10, we should return $120 as the result.\n- **How would you initialize variables?** Since there are two gym memberships, we would need to store them in two different variables. We should use the names that make sense for this program. \n- **How would a loop like the Loop for Loopers be declared? And what should be in each of the two loops?** We should use two loops. First loop should start with $50, increment of 1 by 1 until $120. Second loop should start with $120 and then subtract 4 by 4 until $72. \n- **What should be the body of the second for loop? Think about the conditions and how they influence the value of your variable.** The condition is if variable x is greater than 70, increment it with 20 until it is equal to 100. \n- **At what point in the program should you stop? What would you return? Explain why. ** As soon as the x is equal to 120, we do not want to run anymore for loops so the program should stop.

{"text": "164 pounds. \n\n### Explanation: \nThe sign says 600 pounds and 80 (64 *2) is the 600 pounds that is the children.  Then 680 (140 * 4.556) is the adults weight.  The extra weight if the children got in was 16 pounds. 16 * 2= 32 pounds.  If you put 32 pounds on one side of 680 that weight would be 15 pounds. Then 680-15= 665 pounds.  Then the additional weight that the next person is suppose to weigh is 665 pounds minus the weight of the first person and that is 679 pounds.  Now because if a person puts 90 pound more that means an additional 90 pounds on one side of an elevaotr so it has to be the same as a side and the other side is 8.5 so subtract 8.5 from 140 for the adults and the other side is going to be 100 pounds and the additional weight that you have to add on is 100 to whatever the maximum load is so the 100 pounds would have to be taken off and whatever the max capacity was less 100 would be what I answered\n\n### Instructions:\nFor each of the following phrases, write a response that appropriately answers the given question.\n\n## **Instruction:**\nWrite a response explaining why a given phrase is correct or incorrect.  \n\n## **Instructions:**\nWrite a statement that clearly explains why a given phrase is incorrect or incorrect.", "answer": " 52"}

But how many questions did they ask?  There was a total of 84.6 people with an average weight per person of 84.56 pounds.  But each person had an average weight of 49 pounds for a total of 502 more pounds.  That means that 45.36% of the people weighed 49 pounds or MORE.

That will give you an averaged height of 40 inches and a range of (30 + 40)(5 = 25. That means that (34.2%) of the people who responded where shorter than 40 inches tall.

{"text": "Answer: $102.45\n\n### Hint:\nFirst, multiply how much the prescription costs per day by how many days he needs to take it.  Then multiply that result by how much the insurance will pay for per pills per day.  Then multiply that product with how many days he will need to take the pills.\n\nThe math: $1.5 x 30 = $45 per month.\n\n$45 x 30 days in a month = $1350\n\nThe insurance costs 40% of each pill, let's put that in a different way so it makes sense.  How much does the insurance cost per pill, each month?  $1350  / 30 days = $45 per day\n\nSince the drug costs $1.5 and is taken 2 times a day, it costs $3 a day or 75cents per pill.  So 45 cents pays for 40%.\n\n$45 cents covers 40% (75cents x 40% = $30)  \nso John would pay $30 for the insurance for his drug each month.  And it costs $45 each day.\n\n\nSo after he paid $45 x 3 = $135, he can deduct $30 of that (45 cents x 30 days) and John only paid $102.50 for his prescription that month.  \n\nThere you go", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "160\n\n### Explanation:\nThe problem in this task is to show a relation between two parameters of the same set.  How do I know? Just by looking at it.  I see it in the question.  It's not that difficult: Input: John buys 10 x 20 = 10 1/4 x 4 = 1/4\n\nI have to make a relation between the 2 parameters.  I don't know how much is in each card: The question says, \"and there are 20 cards per pack but 1/4 of them are uncommon which equals 10 x 4.\"\n\nThe last part, \"uncommon equals...\", shows me I have to make a relation, that is, what is the relation?  This is one of the steps in the process of how to solve any problem involving a relation.  Now how do I find the relation?\n\nI have an idea.  If I know that I am getting 10 x a certain number of cards, then I could make a formula and then find how many cards there are to make sure I have the right number.  How do I make a formula?  1/4 x 20 + ( 1/4 \\* 20 ) = 20.  The problem is I don't know the number I am dividing by and I don't know that number I am adding.  So I must make one last assumption.  I assume that there are 240/4 or 60 cards in the entire pack.  Thus, 10 x 60 = 600 uncommon cards\n\nHow do I find an answer to questions in math?  You can ask yourself, \"how do you get an answer for this math problems?\" You learn how to start by making assumptions and estimating.  The only time we use equations to start is when we go from the bottom up like with algebra.  Usually for questions that you see in math textbooks, there is some assumption or estimation that gets you to an equation and then you can solve the equation.\n\n### Input:(The numbers in brackets show the questions that come after) If n is a positive integer,  what is the nth Fibonacci number?\n\n###Response:55\n\n###Explanation:", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "John has 15 roommates.\n\n### Explanation\n\nFirst I need to find the number of roommates for Bob. To do so, I first take Bob's roommates, which is 10, and multiply that by to get the number of roommate's for Bob. 10 times 2 = 20. Since Bob's number, in this case, is 10. 10 is half of 20. So the number would be 20. To find what the number is for John, I simply subtract 20 and 10 to get 24 to complete the math equation 20 - 20 = 24. To summarize, if 10 is the number of Bob (which is 10 roommomates) and I multiply by 2 to get the number of Bob's roommate (which equals 20).

The ball will end up where it's kicked unless it is first blocked by another player with an outstretched foot.  The ball will go straight or deviate only in the vertical or horizontal plane.

He advertises watches for men, women, and children. 2 to 4 people are ordering products from him daily.

Write a response to John\u2019s email explaining what he should do in this situation.\n\n### Response1:\n\nIt is difficult for both of us to predict what will happen in the future. People are not always happy about the things they have ordered. Sometimes, they make an unexpected but not unfounded complaint about the product. If the product turns out to be faulty, the client has the right to return it. It's John's duty to provide a solution as soon as possible. You should check if you have made a mistake earlier. If not, ask the client to contact you directly if you have any further questions. It is possible that the client will take advantage of the situation, so a warning that you will prosecute will be appropriate in this case.\n\n### Write a script that adds two numbers.\n\n### The output should look like this:\n\n<ul><li>The first number in the output is <b>input:number1</b>.</li><", "answer": " 200"}

In this situation, a truck was using gasoline burning to power itself.\n\n###  Input:How do you find the area of a rectangle? Let's consider a very small one and then generalize.\n### Demonstation:\nInput: For a small rectangle, let's say (3\u00d71), the area is 3 (just like using multiplication).  If we repeat the same rectangle, but put two in a row now, they would make the area (3\u00d72), a square, (as squares are squares). So, repeating the pattern will give a square. If we do that again and again, the shape will be a triangle.\n\n### Explanantion:\nIn order to find the area of a small rectangular, multiply the base (the number in the base, like in 3\u00d71) by the height.  And for larger ones, follow the same rule, but with bigger numbers.  At a certain point, we will have larger numbers than we can handle (at least in one direction) and the other number must be as small as can be, thus leaving us with only one dimension.  At that point, the object is a 2D (or 1D) object, namely a rectangle.  We then know the two dimensions (width and height), so we can find the area by multip", "answer": " 2"}

I was able to solve it and explain it, but it took me 5-10 minutes before I arrived at a correct answer.\n##\tRequest for Support:\nHow the students learn can influence the outcome of the students. One example is in a class when the students ask a question the response can provide a cue to how to learn. If the response to the question is vague or confusing, the learners will struggle to understand or ask clarifying questions. But, if the correct response is provided (the right answer in the instruction). And if the instructor or peer response is a non-threatening response, then the next group will know what to do. Teachers should strive to provide clear, concise responses that match the instructions. The reason for this is to provide a consistent pattern for the learners to follow and understand what to do. With this in mind, my recommendation for teaching math in a high school setting is to provide more than one example as well as having the students solve the problem themselves. Lastly, I would also focus on teaching a skill instead of focusing on a formula (as we will learn in Statistics).", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Mack:\n1 page @ 30 minutes for 60 minutes.\nTotal pages = 60\n\nBetween monday and wednesday, it's not stated whether he's just counting the pages on his journal or the sum of the number of pages in his journal for Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.\n\nEither way, you're asking 60 pages total.\n\nIf the latter, for tuesday (1 page every 10 mins), you're asking for 1 more.  However, because the rate was 1 hour 30 mins, or 30 mins is 4 pages if 60 mins is 1 page.  So it's really counting 4 more pages for tuesday.  That's 63 pages, not 60.  So for wednesday, for 5 pages to give you a total of 68.\n\nBecause it's asked for total, that's what I'm answering.\n\nThe solution is A.\n\n### Question/answer\n\n1. What time does the movie start?\n\nIt starts at 2:10 PM, or two minutes before 2:10.  You can also say at 2 PM, or 2 o'clock.\n\n2. How long does the movie last?\n\nIt lasts for an hour and forty minutes, or one hour forty minutes.  One hour is 60 minutes.  The 40 refers to the 40 minutes, giving you a total of 1 hour 40 minutes.\n\n3. How long is the show?\n\nIt's a 30/90 combo and you just have to sum the answers up.  Since 30 is ten minutes, that means the show lasted 1 hour 10 minutes.  Since 90 is 9 times 10, that's 90 minutes.  That's why you got a total of 2 hours.\n\n4. How many times has the show played?\n\nSince 1 hr is 60 minutes, that means each show lasts for 1 hour.  If there are 30 shows a day, times 30, you get 3 times 30, so 9", "answer": " 10"}

Both matches on day two were against opponents that Joe\u2019s team tied, and those opponents gave Joe\u2019s team 1 point and were also awarded 1 point, meaning opponents tied 2 games each, making a total of 6 points. Joe\u2019s team can only gain points by winning a match or tying a match against a specific opponent. First place beats Joe\u2019s team 3 times, so winning at Joe\u2019s team and Joe\u2019s place ties Joe\u2019s team 2 times, totaling 5 points beaten, which means first place earned points off of Joe\u2019s team 5 more times than Joe\u2019s team earned points over first place, so first place\u2019s total score 6 point higher than Joe\u2019s team\u2019s total. The total score for first place minus the total score for Joe\u2019s team is 6 minus 1, which is 5.\n\n\n### Input Joe has a party where he invites 20 of his best friends.

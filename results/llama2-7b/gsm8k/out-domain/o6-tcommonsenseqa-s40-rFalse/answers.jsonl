John has a little brother who is, in some ways, just like him.  In other ways, John may seem superior.   He tries to help his brother out, but he can't really do all that much.    The little brother is just too small and too weak, and John is just too big and too strong.    Sometimes they have  trouble  staying  together.  It would, of course, be nice if they didn't have to be separate, but when the two of them are apart from their parents, they end up fighting more.   They have never been more than two feet apart when they have been apart from their parents.   Everyone knows why. The most important reason is that the big brother can't stand being told what to do.  And, of course, the big brother's way of expressing that displeasure is much stronger than the little brother's.  A sentence with the same meaning was rewritten like this:    \"John has a younger brother who has been following behind him since he was born but who has begun to lag behind recently.

The current gas tax is 32.5 cents per gallon for regular unleaded. A new government law has recently taken effect, which raises the gas tax by $0.02 per gallon every year, until the tax reaches $4.00 per gallon. It also allows you to \"opt out\". This means the tax only applies if the new rate is the same as your old rate. If you pay the current rate in gas tax every year, you pay less in taxes if the total tax rate goes up than if it stays the same. For example, in 2019, a household that pays $2.50 per gallon at the pump every year with the base tax would pay 32.50 cents in taxes (for a total of $10/gallon) regardless of what the new tax rate is in 2018. If the tax rate goes up, however, then the household pays the new higher rate instead if they're already paying that rate. How much will a household save if they pay the \"base rate\" every year with the \"opt out\" clause until 2028 with the new tax?\nOutput: A : $825\n\nInput : A teacher has one student in her 5th grade class who isn't performing at an acceptable level due to health and behavioral problems.

The number is in line with a report from Gallup, which found that the number has not changed in the last 50 years.  It used to be $60,000 in the 1940's.

We will only use true and false questions in exams.\nFor this assignment, you should develop at least five questions that will be on your first quiz.  This will help you to work through the process of designing and creating quiz questions.  You can use some or all of these questions for your quiz, and you will need at least the minimum of five total questions before you submit this assignment.  Each question must include your question, the answer choices, and the correct answer at the bottom of the question that is correct.  \n\nFor example:\nThe 5-7 class has a lunch.

They should be questions that you can reasonably grade using your gradesheet and that include your code.\n\nFor each question that you create, you should consider a few things:\n\n1. Are there multiple correct answers?  How can you create a question where there is more than one acceptable answer?\n2. What would be the lowest grade you would assign for the question?

For example, the answer 'Though' would not be in the answerDict since it is a compound word. So you would look before and after it for answers in the dictionary.\n\nFor this I first made a list of all the words and answers in the answerDict, which I am calling wordList and answerList. Then, instead of splitting the words by the words in the answerDict, I split it on space, since most questions are compound.

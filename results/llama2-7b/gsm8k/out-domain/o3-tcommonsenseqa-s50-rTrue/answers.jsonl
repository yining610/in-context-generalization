Choices: A: in a family with many children. B: at the grocery store. C: when buying gifts for a party. D: for a workplace when colleagues are leaving. E: at a birthday celebration.\nOutput: The gift you should buy depends on the occasion and the people involved. \n2. When buying for children, it is generally a good idea to get one gift for each child to avoid the problem of them fighting over who gets the most desirable present. However, if there are many children, buying only one gift can become excessively expensive.\n3. It is also important to note that while buying in bulk can save money, it increases the carbon footprint of the purchases.\n4. Grocery stores offer great deals on bundled items and bulk purchases, making it a good option for saving cash.\n5. When buying for a party, it is best to buy gifts in small batches to avoid making a large purchase that no one will use.\n6. At a birthday party, a gift should be personalized to suit the individual whose birthday it is. This requires customization, which makes shopping around for the right item much more of a hassle.\n7. If buying for a colleague for a special event like a retirement party, it can be less expensive to get a group gift from the office rather than selecting the individual's specific preferences.\n8. However, this presents a risk of insulting the colleague if the group gift does not reflect their tastes or if it is not an appropriate item for the occasion.\n9. Therefore, the best time to buy one gift for a large number of people is when there is a specific reason for the purchase, such as for a birthday or holiday celebration.\nIn conclusion, buying multiple gifts at a time can be cost-effective if the products are discounted in large quantities. But, if you only want to buy for one person, it is best to plan ahead and make individual purchases for each person. Remember, the cost of gifting should be", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "1.The correct answer is 26 pounds. For the exercise machine to make the weights 5 pounds heavier on the lower portion, each weight is actually only 34 pounds when coming down (10 * (0.2 * 30) = 34). This indicates that the weights felt 20% heaviest when they were going down.\n2.This can be verified with math:\n\nThe question asks for the actual weight of the weights, but then gives 16 as the answer, not 26.  Tom is not supposed to multiply the given weights by 0.8, though, so we do not need to consider this answer.\n\nInput: What is on both sides of a rope?  Choices:  A. water B. moon C. sun D. bridge\nOutput:1. Water could be on both sides of the rope. For example, the Great Wall of China could pass over the Gobi Desert. Water, however, is the answer choice that is most associated with a rope. Therefore, the answer choice is water.\n2. The moon could be on the right and left sides of a rope. But there are other options as well.\n3. The sun also could be on both sides, and this is the answer that is most associated with the question; however, as we have already selected water, we don't need to consider the sun as the answer.\n4. The bridge can't be on both sides, as it is something that is under the rope. Therefore, bridge is ruled out.\n5. The answer is water.\nSo the final answers are B. Water\n\nInput:What can you use to cut a tree and then throw it into the ocean?

So this is not preferred answer choice.\n3. \"Sword\" can be used to throw while being on ships, but the question is not referring to a ship.

If we look at the first and last number in the sequence, we see that they have a difference of 3, so the product of the first two numbers must be divisible by 3. Let's assume our first number is 5. We multiply our first and last numbers together and get 0, but if the product is greater than 0 it must be evenly divisible by 2, so that also must be a property of our product. Let's look at the difference between our second and first numbers, which will be 2 after dividing by 3 and then by 2. Therefore, since 5 and 18 are consecutive whole numbers, we can conclude they have a product of 105 and quotient of [5/18] which is 0.5.\n3.The first and last number of the sequence would be 5 and 100 respectfully.

Similarly, the problem does not specify if the 'three-quarters of that amount' applies to a single present or to the 'all three presents'. Therefore, it can also be eliminated.3. 'The third present needs the same as both other presents' can also be eliminated because Carrie needs 'the same as' not 'the same as plus the same as'.4.

The second attempt is also wrong. Because if we subtract the answer from the given price it would be 24 dollars. If his purchase was $6 dollars less it would have only been $18 dollars left (total of $183). But since he had $14, it must have been $143 remaining and 5 remaining books to be bought. But also knowing that $14 is already remaining it means that Fred only bought 5 books. In other words: we cannot only buy 5 instead of the 6 books that Fred had at total budget of 200 and the average cost of 40. Therefore, the answer must be 5 and Fred got some money back. \n6. $44 would also produce the same result, but we are looking for the most accurate approximation because Fred doesn't have enough money to buy every book at the average cost of 60 dollars.

She bought 4 oranges, 2 mandarins, and a box full of lemons, which were all placed into a single paper bag. Unfortunately, the bag that all of the fruit had been placed into had developed a hole.

If there are now 195 pieces of fruit in the remaining lemons, what is the total quantity of pieces of fruit Tanya could have purchased?\n```\n-First we have to consider that the entire bag has been leaking and lost some fruit.

{"text": "1 It is only fair I'd leave this question open for a bit longer but this has been a great challenge - Thanks! \nSolution: 1. We can easily eliminate some of the choices in this question based on the information given in the question itself.\n2. For one, choice 2, 'four', is incorrect because it implies that all of the hats in question have the same number of stripes, but according to the question, \"Some of her hats have no stripes at all\".\n3. Also, choice 5, '20', is impossible because it implies that every single one of her hats has four stripes, which is unlikely, according to the question, some of her hats have \"no stripes at all.\"\n4. As such, we can conclude that all of the choices that contradict the information given in the given question can be eliminated. Additionally, choice 6, '32' is not possible because it implies that there are four hats with no stripe, but according to the information given in the problem, some of her hatts \"have no stripes at all.\" We can simplify the answer choices to three: choice 3, 4 and 7.\n5. Now, to derive the answer, we can apply the logic that the number of stripes in her four hats with four stripe and her six hats with no strip will probably far outnumber the two hats with five stripes each, since the number of hats with no strips can add another five stripes, if we count the two hats with no striper, and that means the total number of stripes on all her hats will be more likely to be six than seven.\n6. Lastly, we apply the logic that the probability of one hat with four stripe is unlikely to be more than the probability of six hats which have no stripe on each, this is because even if we ignore the two hats with 4 stripes, the probability of 7 or 8 hats with no stripers is higher than the probability of one hat having 4 stripes.\n7. By considering all of these factors, we can conclude that 5 is the most likely probability of Vaishali having 5 stripes on each of her hats.", "answer": " 34"}

The problem also gives us that half of the spokes go on a pair of wheels and that each spoke goes on a single wheel.\n3. That means there are 4 spokes on each of these wheels.\n4. Multiply that by 2, so there are 8 spokes on each of the rear wheels.\n5. Similarly, subtract 12, which is the number of spokes on the front wheels, from the total 48.\n6.

There is also information given that the store is 'in a city'.\n3. Based on this information we can remove the option of 'Online bookshop' as this is not a location or store, just a means of purchasing books.\n4. We can also rule out the options of 'E-reader' or 'The Smartphone' because they are not physical stores located within a city but simply ways to read books.\n5. So the remaining options are 'Amazon', 'Barnes and Noble', 'Library' and 'Small bookshop'.\n6. 'Amazon', while it may be the largest online marketplace for books, does not actually have physical stores. \n7. Therefore, we can eliminate this potential answer.\n8. This leaves 'Barnes and Nobles', the library' and 'Small Bookshop'.\n9. Barnes and Nobles is a national chain, therefore we can eliminate it along with the option of a small bookshop being the most expensive as it would not be a chain store and might not even be as expensive as the biggest chain store. \n10.

In that case, it would be easier to make an L-shaped biscuit. In this case, the probability can be expressed as:\n  P(12 inches x 12 inches) = 4 possibilities \n  \nP(12 inches x different length) = (12 inches x different width)P(different width) = (3 x different width)P((3 x different width)) = 3P((3 x different length)) \n  So the probability of making 3 biscuits or fewer is 3P(3), where P(3) is the probability of making a 3 x 3 biscuit with a dough that is 8 inches by 8 inches, or 9 inches by 9 inches, or any other size.

We know Pam has more apples than Gerald but Gerald has more bags than Pam, so we know Pam has at least 4 fewer bags than Gerald. \n3.) Finally we know the total number of apples Pam has is 1200, therefore, we know the total number in (at least, but probably more than 3) Gerald's baks is more than 1200. \n4.) We can use the fact that Gerald has at least one full bag more than Pam to work out that Gerald has 460 apples. \n5.) We know that Pam has as many apples in as many of her bags as Gerald has in each of his, that if 3 of Pam's bags have x as many apples as Gerald does, then Pam's 4th bag also has x as many apples. \n6.) Let's consider that Pam has as many of Geradls' bags (at least) as herself, then we can write it (2x + x) bags, then since each bag has 40 apples, we can say 4 (2x + x)+ 40 apples. 7.) Therefore, in our system 40 apples = 2x, we can replace + x by 2x, so Pam has exactly four (5x) bags, which means Geradl has 5x apples per bag. \n8.) Therefore Gerald has 25 bags, and Pam has 40 applieas, therefore the ratio of Gerald's number of apples per bag to Pam's number of applies in each bag is 25 : 40. 9.)

{"text": "1 The first step in solving this problem is translating the given information into a working equation.\n2. Here's what we know:\n3. Kenny played basketball for 10 hours out of the total week (hubbard). \n4. Kenny ran for twice as long he played basketball (hubbard)\n5. Kenny practised the trumpet for double the time he ran (hubbard), as we saw, there are three times altogether, let's call them 'A', 'B' and 'C'.\n6. So far that's 10h/w + 2h/b + 4h/C, which is 16h/w.\n7. So now we know that Kenny played 10h/16h/total, which is 0.6 for us, and we want to find the value of 'C' to solve the equation, let's begin.\n8. The previous information given to us was: Kenny practised on the trumpet double the time he ran, which we will now call 'A', we found out C was twice 'A' which is also 2A (we called A 'A' as that is the amount of times Kenny ran in 1 week, but that is unknown and so we're talking about it in general, i.e. how many times Kenny ran in total). \n9. 10h/A which is 0.8A,\n10. 2A which is 1.6A,\n11. twice 2A which is also 3.2A,\n12. 16h/A which is the same thing, that's why the C is 'unknown'.\n13. But at some point we want to write this, otherwise we cannot work the rest of the equation\n14. Then there are three parts to this, we need to get 16/16/w, we will add them together to do this, so it becomes: A/(total hours) + B + C/(total hours).\n15. So 10h/3.2A + (2h/b and so fourth), so total (10h/3A + 2B and so fourth).\n16. So our answer is that Kenny practiced", "answer": " 40"}

I then found a bottle of wine and two glasses that I could use. The glasses were green and blue and the plates were green and yellow. I didn't know where the napkins were, so I asked my sister. She gave me the key to the cabinet under the sink. Inside that cabinet, I found 8 napkins. I then took 2 glasses of wine, and a plate of fruit. I gave my sister a plate of food, and another plate for myself, but I wanted to save the 2 glasses of the wine to myself. How many napkins were there altogether?\n\nOutput: 1.) In the sentence after \"I didn't know where napkins were\" we can eliminate the numbers of \"napkin\" as we know it was the number of napkins in general\n2.) \"I asked my sister\" tells us that there is more then 2 Napkins, so it is a number between 3 to 8 \n3.) \"she gave me the key to cabinet\" tells us that there are more then", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "1, To solve the problem, we first need to calculate the total amount saved. \n2, Using the known information: $3,00 in the beginning, plus $276 per\nmonth for 4 years with a total of $47,120 in 4 years. \n3. Therefore, total amount saved at the end of 4 year is $3,00 + 47,12\n4. The total amount saved equals $ 50,120. \n5. Next, we need to calculate the amount in piggy after 4 years since the family added $7,0\n00. The amount in piggy will be ($50,12-$7,00) or = $43,120.\n6.\nSo the final amount is $43,1 20 dollars.

The next thing we can eliminate is option Choices: E: 130 because 130 is not the answer and it is a multiple of 66 (which we will come back to later). \n3. However, since 120 can be factored as 3 \u00d74 \u00d7 5 we can eliminate it too since it is a multiple of three other numbers, a common occurrence when working with the number 66. \n4. Kelcie has read 3/4 of as many books as Megan, which suggests we should first work with the total number of books Megan has read.\n5. Since Kelcie has read \u00bc of the total books Megan has read, we can multiply Megan\u2019s total books by 4 and simplify it to 32. \n6. We know that Kelcie has read 9 more books than twice the number of Megan\u2019s books, or 18.  Therefore, the total number of books Kelcie reads equals 32 + 18. \n7. 18 +9 = 27.  So the total number of books read by Kelcie is 32 + 27 which equals 59. \n8.

As such, Elizabeth's net profit (NP) is 0.\n2) First of all, the answer is negative because net profit is not the amount of money one makes.  It is the difference between the amount of money made before expenses and the amount of money spent before income is considered.\n3) Next, the cost of the ingredients is not taken into consideration in determining the net profit. So, the calculation should include the cost, not just the selling price.\n4) Thus, the answer should be calculated by subtracting cost from total revenue: $80 (selling price \u00d7 total amount of bags sold).\n5) The cost of 20 bags of granola using $3.00 in ingredients is 60 ($3.05\u00d720=$60.10).\n6) Subtracting the cost from the selling price yields $0.99 for the total profit.\n7) Then, deducting the remaining expense of the last five bags from the total profit gives negative 0.99, which is -$0.99.\n8) Putting everything together: -$0.90 \u2013 (0 + 0.99 - 3.05) = $0.

{"text": "1. The question asks us to find the number of ripe mangos that are left on the mango tree if Lindsay eats a certain percentage.\n2. The first step is to determine how many mangos are left after Lindsay eats. This is expressed in the question as remaining mangos = (original number of mangos \u00d7 Lindsay's eaten percentage) = (400 \u00d7 60%) = 240.\n3. To calculate the number of ripped mangoes remaining, we need to subtract the number of mangos that have been eaten. As a result, we arrive at the formula (original number of mangoses - number of mangos eaten) = remaining mangos\n4. Finally, we find the number of remaining ripe mangos by substituting 240 for the number mangos eaten and 200 for the number of mangos remaining. This yields the answer 200/240 = 0.8333\n\n5. In other words, 83.3% or 0.83 mangos are left of all mangos on the mango tree.\n6.

This shows that the total flour that Jim has in all is the same as the total flour needed for three loaves of bread. Hence, Jim is able to produce at least three loaves of bread out of 300g. There is no way one can bake fewer loaves of bread since there is always leftover flour, the only other choice is to make more loaves of bread that can be baked out of each amount. This way, Jim can produce 3 loaves of bread out 300g, or 1 loaf of bread out of each portion.

{"text": "The rule of thumb is to eliminate as many options as possible by first determining which variables are fixed and which can be varied. \nFirstly, the variables that are fixed include \"Thor\" and \"Peter Parker\" because they cannot be reworked to fit the question. \nSecondly, \"Captain America\" is also fixed because it is a variable that cannot be modified according to the question. \nThis leaves \"Iron Man\" and \"Age of Iron Man\" as the only variables that can be changed in response to the question.  This means that the other variables i.e. \"Captain America\", \"Thor\", \"Peter Parker\" and \"Age of Captain America\", \"Thor\" and, \"Peter Parker\" are fixed.  Since the age of \"Captain America\" isn't relevant to the question, these variables can be dropped and their values substituted with \"Age of Captain America\".  Likewise, the variable \"Age of Thor\" isn't changed, even though it is relevant to the question.  By following this strategy, it can be observed that \"Captain America\",, \"Thor\", \"Age of Captain America\" and, \"Age of Thor\" can all be substituted with other values with no effect on the solution.  This eliminates all of the values not relating to \"Age of Peter Parker\" (i.e. 1456y).\n\nNext, the equation \"7y+13y=1y\" is applied.  The first step is to recognize that 3 is a common factor of both sides of the equation which can be used to simplify it.  Additionally, division by 7 and 13 leaves 1, indicating that 7 and 16 are the denominators.\n\nThe next step is to simplify the equation further into 7y=16y. Solving for \"y\" gives \"y=2\".  This is the final step where the answer can be obtained for \"How old is Iron Man if Thor is 1,456 years old?\"  The answer is 73.\n\nSo the final answer for \"How old is Thor if Captain America is 145,600 years old? How old is Iron Man then?\" is \"Iron man is 73 years old\"", "answer": " 48"}

P(1) + P(2) + P(3) + P(4) = $60\nSlove of linear equation above is $4, therefore the amount earned is $60 + $4(P(d))\n3. Solving for P(d):\n$60 = $4(P(4)) + $4(P\n4. Substracting equation 3 from equation 2, the equation is simplified and P(d) is represented by $60 -4(P(d)), which in turn can be used to calculate P(d). 4. There are two linear equations which can be used for simultaneous solution of two unknowns, i.e. $60 - $4(18) = 0 is one and 4(32) = $60 is another. But, both the equations provide different values for 'unknown' (P(d)). 5. P = 12, 24, 36, etc.\n6. P = 20, 16, 8, etc.\n7. $60 = $12(2) + $4(1)\n8.

Therefore, we can't determine whether the desired answer should be 12 or 13.  So we remove this possibility.\n2) The second hour is described as \"after the first hour\", so he doubled it for \"after double the first hour\". We are told he did this for all three hours, so \"after doubling the first hour\" would mean he doubled the doubled hour, which he has already said he did not do.  This suggests the doubling in the third hour was the first instance in the three hours.  Then, based on the given information, he doubled the original rate of four questions per hour for the first two hours, but did not double that number again.  From this, we know his rate per hour increased every three hours.  This implies that in the first hour, which takes place before the doubling, he began in a single rate of four questions per hours.

Therefore, the total time for all eight runners to finish the race = 8 + 2 = 10 hours.\n\nOutput:1. In a race, there are two types of runners who are first and last. \n2. The first runner is the runner who finishes the race first, thus the runner who finishes first is also the first runner in the race (1st)\n3.

If it's true that having A + B + C also includes having the opposite of A + B, it could result in a circular argument where it's assumed that having A + B includes the opposite of A + A, but this statement would be circular and unprovable\n2. The question can be reworded to say 'If I have A + B, then I also have A + C when I also have A', this shows that it's not necessarily true that having A + C also includes having A + B as it depends on the initial condition in which A and B are both present\nIn addition, it's possible that having A alone may not include the opposite of A\n\nInput: How many days are there between June 14 and June 21?

Choices:  a: yes B: maybe C: no \nOutput:\n1) A: The 'a' option is incorrect because even if the car is in the letter A, it does not specify whether the 90 degree angles created by the car in A will remain, but rather if they will remain in general.\n2) The 'b' option is also incorrect because if the car is in A, it can easily turn and create angles that are not at 90 degrees with any object, thus making the statement false.\n3) The 'c' option is the correct one because it's a direct contradiction, if A is the letter 'A', it is always at a 90 degree angle. Therefore, once the car is inside 'A', it can potentially not create a 90 degree angles with any object.\nSo the final choice is C: no\n\nInput: A box represents 30% of a quantity.

{"text": "1) The question asks for the combined length of 3 CDs.\n2) We can see that \"three CDs\" is used as a unit to represent the length of the 3 CDs.   \nIt's impossible that we use 2 CDs to indicate 1.5 hours or 3 CDs to imply 2 hours, so the unit used to imply hours is CDs.\n3) Therefore, the total duration of the 3 CD is represented by the number of CDs.  And three CDs implies a total of three hours.\n4) Since the second CD is twice as long as the first CD, it implies that the last CD is four times as long as the first.\n5) So, the combined length of the 3CDs is four hours.  Since we've counted the hours in CDs, the answer is four.\nSo the final answe is B: 4hours\n\nInput:What day is it today?

{"text": "1). Since the cheetah has a top speed of 120 mph whereas the gazelle has a top speed of just 60 mph, it is reasonable to assume that the gazelle would be significantly slower than the cheetah, and as such, would be much easier for the latter to catch.\n2. This can be supported by the statement in the question that states both the cheetah and gazelle were running at top speeds of 60 miles per hour and were initially 21 mph apart.\n\n3. Given that, it can be inferred that at their starting position, the gazelle started off at 10 mph which is the average speed before accelerating to top speed of 6 mph. \n4. The cheetah on the other hand started off at top speed of 65 miles per hour.\n5. The initial distance between the two animals is 135 miles which is not a factor in the question as the question instead focuses on their final distance.\n6. Let speed of the cheetah be defined as the variable x and the speed of the gazelle as the variable y.\n7. Let the cheetah and the gazelle be x and y respectively and the initial distance between them as a.\n8. Therefore we have the differential equation: x' = 1.50x +0.50y and y'=0.50y - 1.50y.\n9. Solving for: x =162.5 x1 = 135 x2 = 147.5  y = 2 x1=42.5 y1=65  y2= 52.5\n10. Assuming the cheetah has no need to accelerate and that both animals run in the same direction, the question can be simplified.\n11. The difference in the cheetah and cheetah speeds is (147.5 - 162.5).\n12. Dividing this difference in speed by the speed of the cheetail gives (147. 5-162.5)/162.5 which is (0.1) or 10 %.\n13. Therefore, considering the average speeds of the gazelle and cheetah we get:\n14.", "answer": " 7"}

The first part is \"Half of the kids are in soccer camp\" and the last part is \"750 kids will go to soccer camp in afternoon\". Thus, the condition should be \"If...then..\" statement, which in this case is \"If Half of the kids...then...Kids will go to sophoccer camp in the afternoon.\"\n3. The second part in a \"If...then...\" statement is an equation to solve. However, in this case, the second part is not an equation to solve but rather a conditional statement that says \"If Half of the Kids...then...they will go to sophoco camp in the afternoon\", which can be simplified to the equivalent statement \"If half of the kids... then...they will go to school\".\n4. Thus, since soccer camp does not have anything to do with going to school, we can simplify the second half of the \"If...then...\" as \"If Half...then...\" - \"If Half...then there will be kids in camp altogether\".\n5.

{"text": "1) Firstly, it should be noted that the total cost of the Uber ride doesn't include the 20% tip of the original cost of $22.\n2) Since the tip amount is not mentioned in the original cost, it can be deduced that it was not included, so the Uber ride cost should be revised to $22 + 20% tip = $27.60.\n3) From the problem statement, it is given that a Lyft ride costs $22 + 4 = $26.\n4) Based on the given information, a Lyft ride costs 4 dollars more than a taxi so the taxi ride cost should be $26 - 4 = $22.\n5) Now, to get the taxi ride total cost, substitute $22 in the equation: $22 x 20% = $4.44 + $22 = $26.44.\n6) From the problem statement and equations, it can be inferred that $26.45 is the total taxi ride cost.\n7) Since the taxi ride cost is $26.40, the deduction of 20% of it gives us $5.32.\n8) Summing it up, the total cost of the taxi ride downtown comes to $26.42 + $5.32 = $31.74.", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "1) First, it should be noted that this is a very wordy question and it is likely that the intended meaning is something different. 2) The wording used, specifically \"with the total number...\" seems to indicate that we should work with the total number of 189, rather than 10 or 17. If this is not the case, then the question will need to be further refined. 3) Given that we need to work with the total number, 189, we can use simplification to convert the 10/17 ratio into a fraction format. 4) If we simplify and we get 31/2, this means we know that the final ratio of dogs to cats = 31/2. 5) From here, we can solve the original ratio easily by multiplying both sides of the equation by 2 to convert the problem to a direct ratio, and we can simplify the answer down to 22/5. 6) Finally, we can easily calculate the answer by taking 22/5 and subtracting it from 10/1 which equals 12.\nSo the final solution is A: 12 \n\nInput:I like my sister, but I hate when she takes my brother's side on everything.

{"text": "1. Working 8 hours and each serving 7 customers per hour, Ann, Becky and Julia each serve the same amount of customers (21), while the overall total is now 51, 7 being served in total 8 hours by three of them and additionally 24 in the extra hour served by Julia.\n2. It is also obvious that Julia's total service is 1/3rd of the total, making her overall service 12 of the 51, not 10.\n3. While there may be different orderings, one way to calculate this is to realize that Julia served 1/3 of the same amount as the other two for some period of time. But since at least 1/7 of these 51 customers cannot be Julia's, either she served 1/4th, 1/5th, 1/6th, 1/7th... of these 51 in either 8 or 6 hours respectively. But this means that for any given customer, Julia served 1/4 or 1/5 of the total time of other two, since she either served the full 8 hours with them, or served half the 8 hours with them. Which means she serves 3 of 21 of the same customers as other two.\nSo the final total service would be 12 + 3*7=51, not 42+7=51 \n\nInput:  How many 4-digit numbers that end in 9?

{"text": "1The first step is to calculate the total cost of the dress based on the 30% off promotion, which means we need to apply the discount rate of 30% to the original cost of $50. 30% of $50 is equal to 0.3 * $50 = $15.  However, since this calculation does not seem to take into account any sale prices, it's necessary to find the sale price to apply the discount to.\n2. To understand this, it is important to recognize that when applying a discount to a product, it is common practice to list the original price and the sale price side by side to show the amount of money saved by using the promotion.  This helps customers understand the benefits they'll receive from using a sale or special offer on a product they're interested in purchasing.\n3. In this case, the sale price is not explicitly stated in the question.  However, by considering the context and Stella's goal of purchasing a new dress for the dance, it's likely that the dress's original cost of $5 is the same as its sale price.  Therefore, to calculate the final cost of the dance we can use $50 + $15 = $65.\n4. This indicates that with the discount, the final cost of the new dress is $65.\nSo the finals answer is E: $65\n\nInput: What is a way to add 3+2= 5?

We should exclude options that are either unlikely to be worn by the average person or that aren't representative of the entirety of their lifetime.\n3. Baseball caps, for instance, are only worn during one season of the year and they are often worn by people who play baseball.\n4. Other types like bowler hats, fedoras, and top hats for instance are too specialized and aren't the type of hat that most people would wear throughout their lifetime.\n5. The \"straw hat\" refers to sun protection, however in some areas of the world this is not worn all year round.  It's not universal nor does it represent a lifespan. \n6. Finally, wool caps tend to be worn only during cold weather seasons or by skiers, also not indicative of someone's entire life.\n7. All of these exclusions leave us with the answers B: fedora, beanie style hats or C: woolen hats.\n8.

If a property sells for more than $765,000, why does it make the person bidding for it happy?\nOutput: \n1. If a property sells, or has a bid of more than $76,000 it is clear that the bidder will lose the property because selling or bidding for something at a price that is more than its worth is a common scenario. If we use the word 'lose' here, it is used in the context of losing the bid.\n2. Therefore, as price of the properties keeps going up, the bidder will keep getting less and less amount to bid for the property, which would not make him happy. \n3. However, the word 'happy' here is used in a different way of feeling happy or content. It conveys a sense of satisfaction and fulfillment on achieving one's goal or object, but not of the cost that one incurred to reach there. \n4.

Fabric is third, stationery is quarter (1/4 = 0.25), the rest is another fourth (0.25 * 3) and sum those up, it is 0.25 * (1/4 + 0.25 + 0.24 + 0.1), which is 0.144, which is more than half (>0.5 = 3), the answer should also be less than 0.5, 1/4 * 1 = 25%, 1/3 * 1 = 33% and they add up to 25%. You can see that you can go to either way (from 1 way or 3 ways), the rest is also 0.25 or less. 5. It is not a simple arithmetic, you cannot put (0.24 or 0.1) in 36 and expect the answer to be 1. You have to take their sum which is 0.26 which is not 1. 6. You cannot simply use \u00f7 to get answer for third and so on if the sum of the two doesn't equal to each other, the other way to do that is multiply those two together to get 0.24, subtract to get -1.12, divide to get 0.1125 and then sum to get 0.45\n7. They made 33% of the sales in the stationery and rest is in the fabric section, the sales of the stationery was 33% of 36, which is 12%.\n8.The answer is 12.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "Since Sansa is an artist, we can assume that she is not interested in selling any number that is less than 1, so \"0\" will be crossed out from the possible solutions.\n\n1. Since Sansa sells 3 x 8-inch and 5 x 16-inch paintings in a day, she sells 15 paintings a day in total.\n\n2. By using the price and selling price of paintings, we can write the formula as follows:\n`Sales price = (1/12*width of painting) + (2/12*width)^2 + (5/12*width**3)`\n\nThis formula says that the sales price of painting is proportional to its width. \nWe also know that\n`Sales price(3*8-inch portrait) = Sales price(5*16-inch portrait)`\n\nFrom this, we can solve for the widths:\n`Width of 8-inch portrait = 1/4 of the width of\n  16-inch portrait = 5/4 of 16-inch`\n\nTherefore, the solution can be determined as follows: `8-inch x 1/2 = 4 inches,\n  16-inches = 5/4 x 16 = 20 inches`\n\n3. She earns: $20 for the 8-inch painting, and $100 for the 8 x 16-inches paintings.\nIf she sells three 4 x 2-inch paintings and five 20 x 8-inch paintings per day, how much does she earn 9 days?\n`8 inches * height of 8-inch painting * 3 = 12 inches`,\n`20 * height of 16-in. drawing * 5 = 20 *16`.\nNow, we know that the solution contains both the height of a 4 inch and 20 inch portrait.\nTherefore, the answer is as follows- 4 x 12 inch of which 20 x 16-12 inches = $4,800.", "answer": " 195"}

It is open-ended and flexible.\n4) So, the question of what number of hours of practice does Randy need to become an expert in piano or a master player becomes an open-ended integer and it can be any number greater than or equal to 1.\n5) With that being said, if Randy is practicing every day for 6 hours for each of the 242 days or 78 weeks or 1040 days within a year he can then become a pianist in just 7 years.\n6) That is because, if the 10000-hour (1000) rule is implemented correctly it means Randy will become a pianist before his 20th birthday.\n7) This is because, after the first 52 weeks of practice if the pace sustained, by the end of the next 52 weeks \u2013 Randy will be a master of the piano!\n8) So the answer is 7.\nSo the final (correct answer is) B: 7\n\nInput: Find the missing 6 digit number that is the sum of the given digits?

The base step: if a is less than x, then so too is (a+x). Let us assume that the step holds: if a is an nonnegative integer, then so too, is a+x. Let us then consider the case where a is an nonnegative fraction. Because a+x is greater than both a and x, a+x is an rational integer: we know that 22 + 7 = 29 is a rational integer. Since in the inductive step: given that (a+x) is an integer, then it is a rational integer, we have proved that a+x is also an rational integer for a+x \u2265 0 and a\u2265 0. Hence our inductive step was valid. \nHence, the base step proves the inductive step holds, and furthermore, the step itself is valid. Therefore, the inductive step is sound.

Each boxer has, say, 1000 punches in his repertoire. In 100 rounds, how many points a boxer will score averaged over this match is one of the quantities of interest. The actual number of points scored by a particular boxer in one round depends on a number of external factors which vary from round to round. These include the position each boxer is in (ie, aggressor or defender), the number of good shots hit by each boxer, and the number of bad punches hit by each boxer. If A\u2019s average score in a certain match was 10 higher than B\u2019s how would this 10 difference be distributed?\nOutput:\n\n\n1. So, the match ends in 100 rouns.

{"text": "1) The question is asking how much time Max spent doing his homework, not how much time he spent on a specific subject\n2) When solving algebra questions like this, it's important to first solve for x or for the other variables, which are the total time spent doing homework and the total time spent on each subject, and then work backward to find the answers for x and y.\n3) The question information indicates that Max spent 20 minutes doing his homework on biology. This can be written as 20 minutes as his biology homework. He also spent three times the amount of time on history, 60 minutes. This can be written 60 minutes - history homework.\n4) Similarly, it is known that Max spent three times the amount on geometry homework, 90 minutes. This can also be written 90 minutes - geometry homework.\n5) Using the known information and algebraic equations, we can subtract 20 minutes from each part so that our algebraic equation would look like this:\n50 minutes - biology homework, 90 minutes - history homewok and 150 minutes - geometry homewok.\n6) We can then use our algebraic equation to find the total time spent on homework and the total amount of time on each subject by solving for x. Plugging in what we know about the total time spent on history and biology homework and solving for x, we get : History homework = 90 x - 20 = 150 and biology homework = 60 x - 2 = 58.\n7) We can also find the total time spent doing the homework, which we will use to subtract the amount of time spent on each subject.

{"text": "This is a classic \"Skipped-Added\" example. The expression for next week would be `(c%d) + (c/d)`, where `%` is the modulo operator, which always returns an integer between `-1` and `size` inclusive, and `/` is the division operator, which always returns a non-negative floating point value.\nFrom this equation, we can see that the total amount of ceilings that will remain after next week will be `(c%d)+(c/d)`.\nUsing the given information, it can be seen that each week, there are 28 ceilinsthat Michalangelo does not paint.\nHence 28 is the value of `c`. For next week, we have 23=28`c%.23=12ceilings`.\nIn the next week after the one we are currently considering, there should be `ceil`.\nHowever, if we add the `(d)` term from the preceding week and the term from next week, we get `ceil + cceil/3`, and 28 cannot be expressed as a fraction for values of `d` greater than 3. Therefore, `d` must be 3.\nThe next week after that has `ceil + (ceil/3)+(ceil/3)`, and there will be 12 ceilings yet to be painted.\nSo the answer is `ceil + (ceil / 3) + (ceil / 12)`.\nSo the final answer should be 12ceilings.\n\nInput: What 3 digit number with a sum of 9 ends in 985?\nOutput: 989 has a sum of 9.\nSo 989 is the answer", "answer": " 13"}

The basic difference between bacteria and a virus is that a bacterium is a living microorganism, while a virus is a nonliving, infectious agent that reproduces inside a host. A bacterium typically can reproduce on its own, while a virus cannot, making it noncultivable.\nOutput:  An answer:  In terms of structure, a bacterium is much larger than a virus: It is usually several hundred nanometers long and around 0.2 microns, while a virus is much smaller, typically around 20 nanometers in length.\nOutput:  answer:  In terms or reproduction, a bacterium divides into individual \"daughter\" bacteria through binary fission, while a virus has no way to reproduce on its own. During infection, a virus must attach to a host cell and inject its genetic information into the cell in order to reproduce.\nOutput:  In terms of transmission, although bacteria can", "answer": " 21"}

The second part of the question asks us about the total cost of the meal, specifically the total amount after tax or VAT.\n5. Since tax is 25%, we should subtract 25% of the total amount to deduce the cost of the meal after tax. So the cost of the meals after tax, with VAT, must be $26 * (100 -25) = 21 \n6. After tax, the cost of the mealmay now be determined, which was $24.\n7. However, there is a final value to be considered, the tip. \n8.

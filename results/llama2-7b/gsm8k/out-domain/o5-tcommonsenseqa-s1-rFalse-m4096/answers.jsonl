Since we need to replace 1 side, we can say 1s, then we only need to replace 2 sides,  and so I know we need 2 lengths of fencing.\n\n### Input:(Continued)\n\n### Response:(Continued)We can solve this by adding 3 times the other 2 sides,and since the 3 times is the same length as the other sides, we can simply multiply the 3 times 3. The 3 times 3 is the answer.\n\n### Response\nThe fence has 2 types of lengths. The first type is 3 times the second type. since there are 3 types of lengths, we multiply 3 times 3 to get the total.\n\n### Explanation\n\n### Input\nThe length of the fence is 2l of a side and 640 feet. the short side is 3l of the long side. So our answer is:\n2l + 640 of the side + 2l + 600 of the long side = 640 because we need to replace the side that is rusted.\n\n### Answer:We need 2 sides of fence,so that equals 2 lengths.\n\n### The two lengths multiplied gives the answer.", "answer": " 80"}

We have the following:\n    P + A1 = 1040\nWhere: R = A/2, P = A + R\n   R = $510/2\n     R = $255\n\nThen,\nP = 1690\n\nBy subtracting A, we get: A - P = 960 - 1690 = -730\nThen it becomes: A - (A + P - 960) = -730 - 1040 = -310\n\nBy adding A1, we get: (A + P - A1) + A1 = 255 + 960 + 610 = 1840\n\nTherefore, A - (A +P - 960 + A1) = -73 - 1840 = -1810\n\nBy plugging into the equation, we get: A = -1160 + 1810 = $750\nTherefore the trader made $750 profit\n```\n\n### Input\n\nI think this needs further explanation.", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": "There were 148 lion cubs born in Londolozi last year. If the death rate was 1 per month, then the death rate was 0.0833 cubs per month. The survival rate of the cubs was 1-0.083, which is 0.9167 or 0.917 for simplicity.\n\nLet x be the number of cubs at the start of a year, then the cubs at the end of that year were x + 148.\n\nTo find the number of cubs born in the first year (which would be the number of cubbs at the start), divide the number of cubs living now by the survival rate.\n\nThere are 148 cubs living now, so the cub count must have initially been x + 146. x + 145 must be greater than 146, which implies that x must be at least 1.\n\nTherefore, there were at least 1 cub at the start. 148 is then x + 147, x must then be at least 159. In the first year, there must be at least 62 cub that were born.\n\nThen the cub count in the second year was x+62. To begin, the cub count could always be in the hundreds, and at least 62. Then next, 62 cubs would have been born. If cubs are dying at the rate of 0.0333 per month, it would be easy to figure out how many cubs will survive the year.\n\n### To begin, the cub death rate was 0,033 cubs per year, so the cub count of next year must be at least 23680 cubs. Therefore, the surviving cub count in the second yeats is x + 62. The surviving cub count is equal to the next year's count plus all the previous years cub counts together. In the case of this question, it is 1+62 + 62+62+62 + 1 + 1 + 6+126=23681, or at least 23, 681.\n\nThere are now 23,681 cubs", "answer": " 100"}

You're encouraged to explore the logic in each language you study, and by using hands-on instructions you'll be able to do this more quickly.\n\nTo see how this is done, you'll follow several basic tutorials of Python commands along with the responses they should generate. You'll then create your own questions following along with the instructions presented here.\n\nEach of these tutorials can stand alone, but the better you understand the previous one, the more likely you'll be to create questions that you find interesting.\n\nWhile you're learning python, you'll be asked to create a response by using the correct answer to a question. This involves identifying the options provided as the answer might not be a \"word for word\" match of the response you're expected to give.\n\n## How to respond correctly\n\nTo help you understand programming, you'll start with simple instructions that you'll then learn how to answer.\n\n### Create responses to simple programming questions\n\nLearn how to identify python answers by looking at them as they resemble each others.\n\n### Find options of possible answers\n\nTo find a way to correctly answer an instruction, you'll notice several options. Each option resembles the response given, and it's your job to find a way to create a response that you can easily come up with.\n\n### What makes an answer\n\nTo come up with an answer to an instruction, you're expected to write a response that you can understand. It needs to make sense and be accurate enough to convince someone that you can answer a question using the knowledge you've gained from studying this language.\n\n### Answers made up of words\n\nYou're expected to use words in your answers. These words should be put together as though they're written in sentences. Remember if you're in an app or game and someone tells you to collect some objectives or complete a task, you'll need to respond by creating a list of all these objectives. This is how you'll generate an answer.\n\n## How answers are written\n\nEach answer is made up of four words", "answer": " 17"}

To solve for the number of pints, we take the number of pounds, divide it by.4, which is what the number of ounces is, then divide that by 12, which is how many pounds a loaf of bread uses.\n\nThis is not as much of a complicated problem as it might seem at first, because we can just take the fraction, and put it in the form, and plug in the numbers, like.4 for the numerator, and take.4 x 10 to bring it back to the same as.4, then do 1.8 x 12.\n\nAnswer: $24.

{"text": "1. Sam can assemble 1 widget (W) in 10 minutes (t=10).\n2. Sam does not work if he's off work, so t(Sam)= 6:00.\n3. Jack may work after he comes back from the loading dock (he has work to do). Let's say Jack works in a time interval that starts 15 minutes later than Sam does (which means Sam's work ends at time t1 and jack starts 15 minutes from Sam's work time and he does 15 minutes' worth of work). In this case, jack does 2*W work (W=2*15) in 15 minutes and takes 15 minutes to do it. I will name this interval t2 and add the time for waiting 15 minutes (15-t2). This way, when jack starts working, he's got 18 minutes and 5 seconds left to work. The time the team worked so far (168 minutes) is t2+t1. When we add t2 and wait time, it's 18 minutes of work, which means Sam's t1 + waiting time should be 168-18 = 140.\n4. Now, Jack also works 2 widgets (W) (18 minutes) from time t2, so it's his work. Tony is new at this. He also cannot do any work at time t2 (he's just started working and Sam and Jack already did 15 and 160 minutes of work, which is more than half of the day, so it's not right that he works when they're already so busy).\n5. So Tony does 1/6th of the work (1/6th*W=W/6), which is 1 widget (just like Sam is doing).\n6. So Tony's contribution is 1 work, which is 140-1=140 minutes at time t3. We've calculated all the times for the team so far, and if we add them up, the total is 140+t3+t4+t5=168+1(18)51+140+1(10)=430 minutes.", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "To answer this question, we must break up the question into simple tasks. Camilla is making pizzas. Thus, our first task is to answer this. If Camilla makes three at a time, and one batch is enough for 3 pizzas, then she would need three batches to make 12 pizzes. Each batch takes 30 minutes for them to be ready. Thus, our first answer is 1 hour for the first group.\n\nNow we must do the next batch. We need to determine how to fit two pizzas in the oven. Since we know that one batch was 3 pizzas and took 30 minutes to do, we would guess that the oven time is 15 minutes. To the 1 hour that we already determined for the first batch, we need to add another 15 minutes. This is equivalent to 1 hour and 15 minutes. That is how many hours it takes to finish pizza.\n\n### Challenge:\nUsing the examples above, make some of your own tasks.", "answer": " 5"}

Your response should appear formatted using the instructions below.

Paragraphs are one thought per paragraph and no longer than 4 sentences. Correct grammar is also mandatory.\n\n### Justified Answer: The way to get an answer is to divide (20%)(3/5)(1/2)(1/3). However, the answer is not to multiply it to get 40%. It is to simplify the answer by canceling out the 3/5 because it is less than 1. Then, by canceling the 3/5, all division equations are divided by 2. Therefore, all you have is 2/5 because there was no division after canceling out the 1/2.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Loraine used 12 stamps total.\n\n### Rationale:\nLoraine made 3 times as many small animals than large animals. She made 3/4 as many large animals as small animals. Loraine made 3/4 of the large animals she wanted, so she started with 4 sticks and 3/4 sticks. To find how many, I had to multiply 4 by 3/4 and get 3, so then I have 4+3=7 sticks of wax. 3 times 3/4(large animals) is 3/8 of the large animals we made.

His friend Sheila is encouraging him, urging him forward in the process of mastering piano playing.\n\n### Input/Assumption: I am writing this in code (C#)\n\n### Input and Assumption:If you were 59 today, 60 days ago is Dec 30th, for the past 60 days you have been 58 to 59 years old. You were 58 years old 60 days ago because that is your current age minus 7 days, but let's call it 60 days old as opposed to 60 days aged. You are 61 days old today, today is January first, which is 61 days old, so you could be 60 days old in 364 days. 60 days old minus 60 days of playing 60 days equals 0, which means you don't know how long it takes, you are stuck at 60 days old, you haven't advanced in the process of learning to play the piano yet.\n\n### Response and Assumption: I need to find the elapsed time (number of days) between December 30th and January 1st. I can do it with a subtraction statement. `Math.Abs((DateTime.Now.Year - (DateTime.Now - (DateTime.Now.Date + 60).Date)).Days)`. \n\n### Input (Inference/Deductive Reasoning): If Randy's friend Sheila told him that you become an expert in piano playing in 10,050 hours after practicing for a while, you would need to practice 364 days times 10,030 times 24 hours to become an expert in piano (piano master). This is equivalent to 1,549,800 hours of practice.

The first buyer purchases two bunches containing 10 and 11 carnations, respectively. The second buyer buys three bunches: two containing seven carnations and one with six carnations. Which buyer buys the more carnations?\n\n### Solution: The second buyer buying three bunches of carnations, one containing six, two containing seven carnation. The cost of the carrions is $200, $168, and $88 and the total number of carnations is 15, 21, and 19 respectively and the answer is the second buyer buying more carnations.\n\n### Solution Using variables:\n\n- First_bunch is the 1st bunch\n- Second_bunch is the second bunch\n- Third_bunch is the third bunch\n -Third_bunch is the total number of carrions in third_bunch\n -Second_bunch is the number of carrions are second_bunch\n -First_bunch is the the number of carrion at first_bunch\n- The total first and second bunch is the total of the two bunch\n\n- total_bouquets is the total of the carnation\n\n\n- We first calculate the variable to start with, namely:\n\n    Third_bunch = 9\n\n- Then we do the first_bunch and second_bunch are multiplied by 4 to get the total bunch, then we multiply the  total by six and divide it by 25, then we subtract of 43\n\n\n- So 9/25 gives 0.36 that is the answer.", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "$3.30\n\n### Explain: Susan wants to buy a can of salt for every 10 potatoes. We can count the number of potatoes because each potato is clearly stated in the question. We can count the cost of each potato because the question gives us the cost of a potato. We need to know how many batches of the recipe that require 4 potatoes and a teaspoon of potato. This number of batches gives us the total amount of potatoes that needs to be purchased. This total amount of potatoes can be multiplied by a cost of a potato to get the total cost, this result from above. Then the price of 1 batch of the recipe includes 2 teaspoons of salt. The cost of this 2 teaspoon of salts can be multiplied by the total amount of recipes to get the total amount of salt. The total salt can be added to the total cost of the potatoes to get the total cost for the party.\n\n### Input A: The average cost of groceries for a family of four per week is $54.61. In the store you can pay $600.00 for an unlimited use debit card. Using the debit card you save $63.14. How many weeks do you save if you use the debit card?\n\n### Dem: The question gives you two variables, the cost of groceries and a price of debit card. Cost of groceries is given by $54.6 per week. So in a week they spend $54.6 for groceries. The price of debit card is 600 dollars. Let p = price of debit card and g = groceries cost per week. We are using an equation to subtract groceries cost by groceries costs * price of debit card = cost of groceries - cost of groceries * price of debit. The cost of groceries is 54.6 by this equation. The cost of grocery for 1 week = $54.6 * p - $54.6 $63.12 and we solve: $54.6 = $54.5\n\n### Input B:If you sell an eggplant for $7.50 and a pepper", "answer": " 12"}

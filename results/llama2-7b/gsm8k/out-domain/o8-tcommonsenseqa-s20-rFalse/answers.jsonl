The third-place\nwinner receives $120 ($120 + $0). The second- and fourth-place winners\neach get $142.40 ($110 + $140 = $142.36).

Each person from seventh\nplace through to ninth place is exactly where they should be.\n\nThe tenth-place writer receives $23 (150 - $200).

{"text": "101\n\n### Explanation:\n\nYou have a car and are looking to park in a parking garage. There are N floors and i is the floor count.\nIf the floor is 0, the number of remaining vacant parking spots is either 1 or 2 (58/59 floors. 59-1=48 and 58-1=47). If the floor is i, the number of remaining parking spots is floor * 100.\n\nThus in an n-floor parking garage with i open parking spots remaining, the total is i*100 but we need to be sure that the result is not negative. If it is negative we want to add one to it.\n\nIn case you are puzzled by the floor *100, this is because the count for open parking spots is unique for each level. For example, if i is 0, then the number of open parking spots will be either 1 or 100 and this determines if we end up with the positive or negative result.", "answer": " 186"}

He was friendly too and had some hamburgers that were even better looking. Again, when I asked him how much I owed him, he had the same problem I had before and counted the same way too. I paid with the same amount I had before and he accepted it all.\nThis time he was even more friendly and gave me a complimentary drink to go with my new hamburger. When he was done, he started to pick some coins out of a bowl to pay me. He counted the coins and they came to exactly one dollar more than I had put to pay him. Then he counted over all my change.

A large sea slug which was the egg of the mother shark.\n\nInput: An Eskimo couple (Ittimangnark and KingNook) lived far up in Alaska and had two children. One day they made a huge mistake. It was a terrible mistake. Instead of giving their children only vegetables and meat as many other Eskimos did, they gave their children everything they asked for from Eskimos. The two children were very happy for the first few days, but their parents quickly found out that the children were going hungry and were starving. So KingNook and Ittimangnark decided to eat the youngest child (Oomyapeck). They ate him all up but still were hungry. They started to starve, so they decided to eat another. Their other child had eaten so many candies, cakes and other sweets that he had literally swollen up to be as large as two or three elephants! But after the older child was completely eaten, the Eskimos still couldn't fill their bellies. The next morning, they awoke to their child's complaints about a terrible headache and feeling quite sick. They immediately called the Eskimo doctor. When the doctor arrived he examined Oomyapeck and told them that their child had a fever. However, the doctor told them that he would give their child some medicine to bring down the fever, but he wasn't", "answer": " 4"}

Use code with the correct syntax and indentations and format.\n\n**Idea**: You should follow this format for code, so that the person reading your code knows how your code works(i.e. no one will get confused).\n1. 1. **include** all of the library files you need to run the program.\n2. 2. **import** the variables you will use.\n3. 3. **variables**  should be declared where they are first used. They must be declared in an import section (imported from an imported section) so that the program knows who they are and what they do. You may also declare them in the beginning, before any other code is run.\n4. 4. **assign** your variables where necessary. Assign to a variable to use it later. This should also be done in an import section if you have imports.\n5. 5. **use** your imported variables. Now that you have imports, everything else in your code must also be imports so that it has a specific home.\n6. 6. **function** s should be declared before being used, and called using function names. Functions should be wrapped in braces ({}).\n7. 7. **end function** on functions that you are done using. It is not necessary to end functions if they are not completed, if they will be used in another function, or if they are being used by something else.\n8. 8. **conditional** statements, such as if and else-ifs, should follow code like a piece of math. They must always have parenthesis. It does not matter what logical operator you're using. A semicolon should be used after an else-if.\n9. 9.**print** and **write**. Must be written in quotes.\n10. 10. **end sub** end the variable once it has been used.\n11. 11. **sub** or **dim**. Must be written like **Dim** and have a value.\n12. 12. **output** should not be written in quotes unless you're writing a list. Must be written in double quotes.\n13. 13. **exit sub** end a function", "answer": " 54"}

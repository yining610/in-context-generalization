{"text": "she sold 34 more in May, how many did she sell all together in April and may? Choices: 51 49.1 53.1 58\nRationales:1. She sold clips to her friends, and 48 of her friend's bought the clips in April.\n2. She sold 34 clips in may, hence she sold 48 + 34 of the clips in April and May\n3. So after adding the number of clips she sold in April and May she got 48 + 29 or 88.\n4. Therefore 88 - 48 = 40 = 48 + 48 = 56 - 34 = 52 = 52.1 = 49.9  = 49.1 = 51.  This is how you got 51, 49.1, 51, 53.1, 58 as your choices.\nAnswer: 51.\n\n### Input The teacher gave a worksheet on animals. The students were to make four columns. There were five rows at the top. All animals started with one letter on their left side. For example, \u201cC\u201d on the left side. Cheetahs, cats, cows, crickets, and crematories were examples of things in the right columns. The teacher also gave them an assignment. Choices: A: Find an animal and put the capital letter of the animal, put a period, and draw a symbol of it. Choices: B: Find out what creatures started with a letter, draw a box around them, and make one letter out of them, then underneath draw a symbol. Choices: C: Find an animal that is a letter, draw a symbol of it under it. Choices: D: Draw a picture of what creatures started with letters, draw a box around each of the animals.\nRationales:\n\n1. A: Find an animal, and put the capital letter (the animal starts with a capital letter), put a period, (draw two dots), then draw a symbol (draw a dot under it).\n2. It is easy to choose a name because of the list of animals given and its capital letters.\n3.\n4.", "answer": " 72"}

Letters are documents written to communicate with someone. Letters can be short or long.\n2. James is writing to friends. The number of pages in a specific letter is determined by the word choice (i.e., short or long) and the topic of that conversation.\n3. A 3-page letter can be written in 2 days based on the average letter size of 2500 words.\n4. Every 2 days, James is writing one letter to 2 friends. This leads to the conclusion that he will run out of pages if he writes two pages to every friend instead of three.\n5. We can use the information of 104 days (half of the answer choices 24, 104, 214, and 52) to help us come to conclusions about the possible answers.\n6. Using the concept of dividing by half is a simple way of making a logical deduction.\n7. We know that if 104 days runs out of paper, it must be a factor of 2.\n8. 52 weeks is also a factor of 2, so is eliminated from the list.\n9. 24 days and 214 days are not factors of 2, so they get eliminated.\n10. 7 years is also a factor of two and gets eliminated. The only possibility that is left is option C: 214.\n11. The only conclusion is that James will not run out of paper within 72 years.\n12.

You have to count the number of mango trees that randy has altogether. You should start with the number that randy has from planting which is 60 mangoes.\n2. From the mango trees that are in a greenhouse, there are only 55 mangoes.\n3. Subtract your answer from the number of mango that randy have altogether and you'll get the number of mangoes that randy still has altogether.\n4. It is necessary for you to identify and list the number of mango from each type.\n5.

Choices: 4x - 2y, x - 6y, x + 1y, 4y - 3y, x + 2y\nRationales: To answer this question we need to determine the solution from the options that we have. We know that we have 4 different equations.  We could solve each of them first and then choose the one that is closest. First, we can eliminate some of the equations by evaluating which one is the largest. We can identify the value of 4y -3y by factoring out the 4, which gives the answer 12y. We know that this answer does not apply in any of the equations and will never become the answer. Now, we can identify the smallest answer. For the options x +2y and x-6y, the 6y will go to the left side because y is a number, therefore, the answer will be x +6. For the equation 4x -2y, the 2y will be factored out, giving us 2x. Finally, for the option", "answer": " 85"}

Other\nRationales: Bella must have bought the stamps for mailing documents. Since mailing is different for government and non-government documents, Bella should have bought stamps from the correct place. \n2. Stamps are a government product so she must have bought them at the government run/owned Post Office. \n3. There is no way she could buy stamps at a Non-Governmental Organisation. She might have bought stamps from a stamp shop or from a store that sells postage but they aren\u2019t correct because they aren\u2019t owned by or affiliated to the government.

In a question about a car's journey through a tunnel, the information provided, \"after a while the car must leave the tunne\", offers a description of the moment when the car emerges from the underground space. \n2. With the implied condition that the car can make a turn, the option \"The car cannot make the turn\" is not relevant to the statement and can be eliminated from options. \n3. Looking at the other options, we can analyze the information in the statement and see that it can still be true even if the car is driving slower or if there is a guardrail as the car doesn't necessarily have to drive slower due to the tunnel and doesn't necessarily need the guardrail to avoid danger due to the nature of the tunnel. \n4.

We can write the equation as: (5/7)*7/4 = 7/4\n\nFor the second equation, it means to multiply '9/28' of '12' (1/28*12). We can write it as: 9/28*1*28=9\n\nWe can notice that 9/28 is equal to 3/9. So we can write the second equation as: 3/9*3/12 = 3\n\nSo we can conclude the equation as: (3/9)*3/12 (3/9)*12 = 3 which is equal to B.\n\n### Rationales: \n\nThe first step is to notice that the question is written in fractions.

How much does James earn while working in all of his jobs combined? Choices: \nA: $34 an hour  B: $60  C: $144  D: cannot be determined  E: none of these\nRationales:\n1. James earns $34 an hour while working in all of these 3 jobs combined. He has an hourly income rate of $34 and works for 40 hours a week. This sums up to an income of $1360 a week. \n2. To earn $1360, James has to work 40 hours in his main job and 3 workdays (3 daytimes) in his side job.\n3. The side jobs he works for 3 days a week are a 100% of his hourly rate.\n4. He earns $240 a week in the side job every week and $14 per hour extra in the main job on the weekends. \n5. Working these 3 jobs for 40 hours every week will give James a weekly income of $13160. The extra amount he would have earned is $440 a week. These calculations will be applied for the entire year; hence, his extra income per year will be $440 X 52 weeks (1 year). This equals $22480. The total amount of his earnings every week will be $1316 + 2248 = $35448.\n4\n\n### Input; The following table shows population totals and expected population totals based on estimates for various birth and death rates.

Choices:  a: 52 b: 233 c: 240 d: 182 e: 178\nRationales:1. All of the questions we ask about a trip through the lake are related to time.\n2. Each trip takes a certain number of working hours (weekdays).\n3. If we had to count the number of trips throughout the year, we would have to consider not only the number of days in a year, but also the amount of working hours and days in a week.\n4. If we look at the options of the trip times, we notice that option (d) is too long. While we could calculate the trips in 12 hours increments, it is not a convenient way to determine the number of trips for the year.\n5. Also, the days per week are not relevant for the trips that are made on public holidays.\n6. By looking at the given options, the most efficient trips occur when 4 trips occur in one day (option (a)) with each trip lasting 10 hours. Also, the longest trips involve 2 trips in a week for 14 hours (option (c)) also falls into the category of the most efficient trips.\n7. But the trips that last 4 hours or 6 hours fall out of the category of efficient trips for their respective days because they include unproductive work time; the company cannot work during these time periods to their full potential.\n8.

Options that involve geographical regions such as north, south, Europe, and Asia are all irrelevant to Turkish cuisine and not traditional dishes from its culture.

This answer implies each person has to pay half the total cost or $3 towards it. But this does not match the fact that each person has paid $3 according to the question given.\nRationales : The answer is not an accurate way because it does not consider the amount each person has paid or that each person has to cover a cost of $3. \nInput:Option C: There is no answer that can be deduced from the question that matches the amount each person has covered.

Therefore, there must be at least 10 boys that are good at soccer, and there could also be some that aren't good enough. (We know that they are good enough only if there is no one else with a higher skill in team soccer.) So, we can see that the minimum number of boys is at least 10 who are good at soccer. There could also be a smaller number of boys that aren't good.

That means the cost of his purchase is related to the number of books he will buy for the semester.\nRationales: The choice of $960 as a spendable amount has a relation in real terms to the number of books that can be bought. The student has $960 in total of his own funds. The amount is more than sufficient to take care of the basic needs of the books.\nOption 1: $380 has been spent on books, so $960 \u2013 $380 = $580 is left to spend on books.\nOption 2: $960 has been left to spend. The student can buy 960/9 = 106.67 books with the $960 left in his funds.\nOption 2 makes sense in practical terms rather than Option1 since a book of $100+ is more frequent in the books. \nOption 3 is out of bounds since it considers the remaining funds as \u2018money\u2019, rather than \u2018books\u2019. \nOption 4 does not make sense, since Option 1 and Option 2 have explained the remaining funds for different number of books, and hence the answer can not be the same.\nOption 5 was answered wrong since the student spent $380 as against only $300.

There is no way that a scroll which has a volume of 8247.5 cm+1017.5 cm is smaller than a scroll which has a length of 4687.5 cm and a width of only 220.25 cm.\n4. Therefore the answer must be option A: 5m.\n\nAnswer: A: 5 m\nRationales:1.the volumes of the 1st and 2nd scrolls could be found by multiplying the length by the width or width by the length. The first result is 5,434.05 cm and the second is 510 x 74.5 x 5.5 = 4847.46. The width of the second scroll is given, while length of the third is not given.\n\n2.The length of 3rd scroll should be larger than the 1st scroll. In other words, volume of 3rd scroll > 5,430. The volume of 3rd should be larger than 700 as it has the shortest dimensions of the scrolls(500+100).\n\n3.Option A has the 3rd scroll with the shortest dimensions, and is the only one.\n\nComment: As it\u2019s currently written, your answer is unclear.

{"text": "work.  70% of the drivers do not take public transportation.  90% of the drivers drive themselves to work. How many of the employees drive themselves to work?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: It may seem obvious, but it's not the job of the reader to make assumptions about what the question is asking. What the question is asking can be inferred from the sentence itself.\n\n### Rationale: \n1. Given that the question asks how many of the employees drive, there are two possible answers: those that drive and those that don't. \n2. However, the question also asks percentages (60%, 70%, 90%) which means that there will be either more drivers (60%) or more non-drivers (40%) \n3. Therefore, the answer has to take into account both the drivers and the non-drivers, not just one. \n4. Furthermore, the question asks how many, so an individual percentage (30%) cannot be used as the answer. \n5. The only option that gives us the correct answer is 170, since 170 + 0 = 170. \n6. Therefore the correct answer is 70 + 170 = 174 or 173 if rounding is necessary.\n\nAnswer:   92\nInput: What is the sum of 299 and 133?  Choices:  A; 435 B: 332 C: 434 D 268 \nRationales:  1. We are asked to find the sum of two numbers, 299 and133. \n2. Addition is done by adding like units in the two numbers, then adding the units together.\n3. There are two different ways to do 299+133, adding ones, or adding tens and ones. 4. If we add ones, then sum the two digit numbers, then add the carries, then add whatever is left that did not carry over to the units place.\n5. So, there are two possible ways to do the sum:\n6. 299+0=299 \n7. 300+1=301 \n8. 3", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": "also have a birthday party for the whole family on the same day each year.  What day can it be? Choices:\n\n1. A: Saturday B: Sunday C: Friday D: Wednesday\nRationals:\n\n2. This problem is a variation on the classic \"4 sisters in 4 different birth days\" problem.\n\n3. Because the four children all share the same birthday, we need to make the assumption that two or more of them have the same day.\n\n4. This also tells us that there are two families for who the Birthday is on the same day.\n5. Using our assumption, we can exclude four options, as they will have the same day as the siblings, so in addition to Saturdays, Sundays, and Fridays, we can also eliminate Wednesdays.\n6. Because the family always celebrates their birthday together on a single day, Jolene and Phil would have a day in which they will celebrate with a birthday party for all the children and family.\n7. So while any day of the week can have a party, we are looking for a date where both Jolene and Phil share the same birthday with the children!\n\n8. With this assumption the most likely and viable answer is C: Friday, therefore the answer is C: Friday\n\n### Demostraitation:\nAnswer: C: Friday\n\nInput: If it\u2019s Saturday in Paris, then what is the day of week in Rome and what is the day in Zurich?

This is a classic question about a time that is different between two cities.\n\n2.  There is an obvious problem with the \"Paris\" answer. If it is Saturday in Paris and it is Sunday in Paris, then the question should only be about cities that are within the same time zone, even if they are in different countries.\n\n3.

D: when her brother was halfway done growing\n5. E: when her brother was getting older\nRationales:1. Her brother's birth date is unknown, which means we don't have any reference points or hints on how much younger or older her brother is compared to her. \n2. Since we don't know exactly how old her brother is and all we know is that Kate bought the balls when her brother was born, \"when her brother was born\" is impossible. The most logical inference is that Kate has bought these balls before his birth, making option B the first feasible answer. \n3. The next part of the question says Kate's brother was 16, which obviously doesn't make sense. So the next logical option is option C- when her brother was 6. \n4. Given the information and the only fact we can be sure of is that Kate has bought the balls before her brother was born.\n5. But option E doesn't make sense because it doesn't mention when Kate bought the balls, this option is irrelevant to the question so it's not the correct answer. \n6.

{"text": "An elephant can run at its maximum speed of 15 kilometers per hour. How far does a fox need to run to pass an elephant running in the same direction? Choices:  S: half S+V: more than 2 times longer\nRationales: The fox will pass the elephant when it reaches the speed of the elephant\n1. The question asks us to calculate how long it takes the fox to catch the elephant. \n2. To solve this question, we need an estimate for the time it would take for the fox to catch up to the elephant in terms of distance.\n3. This estimate can be done by dividing the speed of the elephone with the speed of the Fox.\n4. Since the elephant runs faster than the fox, it would take the fox longer to catch it. \n5. With that said, the answer would show the ratio of the time it takes the fox and the ratio of their speeds. \n6. Therefore, let's consider the amount of time, which the fox needs to catch-up as the variable s.\n7. As the elephant runs at a constant 15 km/h, we can estimate the time it takes the elephant to reach its maximum distance.\n8. So, if s represents the time it would take to catch up, then we could write out s = 50km/h / 15km/h\n9. The formula for solving for the variable indicates that the fox has to travel at 3 times (35km/h) its initial speed in order to catch up (s =35km/h).\n10. The amount of kilometers traveled in this ratio is 50/35 = 1.42857142857 = 1.4 km. \n11. The fox has to travel 1.4km in order to pass the elephant, so the answer is D: 1.4 km", "answer": " 100"}

Here we know there is only one answer to the question which is 3, so the \u2018Several packages\u2019 is not fitting and thus is incorrect. Additionally, the number is not represented as \u2018several\u2019 packages but only as one. 2. It is not correct to say that the packages have 12 kilos in it. We don\u2019t know the unit of kilos is being used. 3. The pictures clearly show that Chelsea is using 24/7 or 4 as the divisor to divide the 24 kilo because the answer is 3 not 12. 4. Hence Option A is wrong. (Several 4 is also not an answer because 4 is not an acceptable unit). \n### Option B: Example: 3 are used to describe Chelse. The number is correct in relation to the question.\n### Rationels:1.There are no pictures to show what happened instead 3 was written down and therefor it is likely the correct answer.2. The correct division ratio is 7/4=1.75 and this is not used in the example so this is unlikely to be the correct answer.3. The correct division ratio of 7/4 is very difficult to write down as the number of digits in it are too many to fit on a single number line. 4.

The well supplies 3 gallons of water each for each day.\nFarmer C has one well and one pond, but the water in the pond is very dirty. We could also use the pond to hold rainwater. The pond is able to hold about 4 gallons of water each night, but also loses 3 gallons of the water each day. What should you do?\nAnswer:\n### Instruction answer: Cary is choosing three pipes from which farm each will get some water. First he places the pipes into a 1-4 order and then for each pipe he picks one of the pipes he wants to use and then places the pipe into the empty well of that farm and fills it with the 3 gallons of rainwater. After all the pipes are filled Cary runs his irrigation system. His system is able to collect the water from the pond at night but at the same time loses \u00be gallons of water each and every night.\n### Demonstion answer: The instruction talks about how the pipes are numbered and how many gallons each pipe brings into the farm it pipes into. As well as the empty well for each pipes. The question asks for what the correct procedure should be.\nThe statement mentions that Cary's system, can collect water from the pond but at the same time each night it loses \u00be gallon of the water each and every night\nTherefore, Cary would not choose to keep this water and each year he would have to collect water. That means when the farm is getting less water with out the \u00be gallon lost of water each night each farm would slowly run out of water.\nThis shows that Cary should use the pipe and water each night from the farm and collect the pond water at night with the pipe instead of choosing not to collect the pond water, so as", "answer": " 36"}

Power property of exponents says that when a positive number is raised to a power and another power it is divided by it to solve it.\n2. Property where one variable is the common factor of two or more is that the sum of a group of numbers is the sum of the multiplied number with the variable.\n3.

Why is using E as our base for exponents, it is because it is easier to write and read and if you used a capital letter then it would be harder to read. Also, if you use a number it needs to keep increasing by 1 and the capital letter just can't do that.\n2. Because e is the symbol for the mathematical constant used", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "how many books does Albert have? \nRationales:The first thing that needs to be done in this kind of question is to make sure you understand what's being asked.\n1. It's important when reading a question to not just read the words directly.\n2. Pay attention to the meaning of the words and their arrangement.\n3. If you need to, read the question multiple times, out loud, and/or underline the sections that are important to you.\n4. You can also read the question backwards.\n5. These methods will help you take a deeper look at it and figure out what's really being asked.\n6. In this question, the word \"times\" stands out, showing that Albert has books more than or in multiples of Stu.\n7. Let's say we want to know how many more books Albert has.\n8. So, the answer would be the difference in the number of books the two men have, which is how many books Stu has subtracted by the amount Albert has more than Stu. \n9. So, 4(4) = 4 x 4 = 16 more books Albert has than Stu. \n10. Therefore, the answer to this question is Albert has 16 more books than Stu.\n### Input: The new penguin arrived in New Zealand and now what? Choices: A: goes to the beach B: jumps onto a ship C: goes to the zoo D: dies\nRationales:1. The answer to the question, \"What does the new penguin that is arriving in New Zealand do now?\"\n2. It is clear the sentence structure in this question is asking us to find and give the answer that comes next or next in line.\n3. So, it will be easy if we look back a few words and find a word that is the opposite of the word it was before or at the end of the sentence.\n4. \"Now...\", being the last word in sentence refers to the present time, and that time is in the future.\n5. Future means that there is still some distance between the time it is now and the time it is in the future. \n6. When there is distance, we always move from one place to the other.\n7.

Option A: the sequence that involves taking medications, checking blood sugar levels, and taking vitamins would be a logical and sensible choice for Holly in order to stay on track with her health goals and ensure that she has everything she needs to manage her health condition effectively.\n3. This sequence is likely to be more effective and convenient than the one in option B, which would require her to take her vitamins between her medications and blood sugar checks.\n4. Option C: the sequence that involves blood sugar checks, taking vitamins, and medications may be a good choice for Holly to ensure that she is managing her diabetes effectively and that she is keeping an eye on her blood glucose levels.\n5. However, it may not be a logical or convenient selection for a few reasons.\n6. Firstly, it may be difficult for Holly to remember to take her medications after every blood sugar check without also taking her vitamins.\n7. Moreover, taking all her medications before taking vitamins could lead to a higher risk of forgetting to take them altogether.\n8.

How many did he keep for himself?\n\nAnswer: Uncle Jude made 256 cookies and gave them away to his sister, his mother, and his cousin. He took 156 cookies for himself.\n\nInput: The first step should be to identify the question\u2019s key words. The first word \"uncle\" gives us the context -- this is a story about an uncle who is a baker. The other words \"Jude\" and \"baked\" both indicate the uncle is involved in baking. We can eliminate the option \u201che is a fisherman\" because \"fisherman\" is not a possible answer based on the question. The other words, \"256\", \"15\", \"8.34\", \"112\" (as a decimals and fractions), and \"cousin\", should all be interpreted as numbers that provide numerical data. This question involves math and will require us to calculate the answer.\n\nNext, we can rule out any answers that do not include these numbers. This question is dealing with the math problem, not the setting of the story. The story elements such as \u201chis sister, his cousin, and his mother\u201d are not important and can be skipped while identifying all possible answers.\n\nAs a next step we can look at the numbers presented by the question. For example, what are the numbers presented at the beginning of the sentence?\nTo answer the question of how many did he keep for him, we can start with the numbers Uncle Jude baked \n\nWe can see that 256 and 256 are the only numbers that appear before the question mark. This tells us that the answer can only be a number. It cannot be \"8.34 or any other unit of measure\"\n\nWe can then combine this knowledge with the information we gathered prior. A possible answer can be a number, because the question demands an answer to a math problem.\n\nLet us now use the knowledge we gained just now to rule out potential answers to the question. If we are to rule out any possible numbers that are incorrect, what do the numbers, \"353\" and \"179\", suggest about their correctness?\n\nFrom the question's context, \"baked 256\", we can conclude Uncle", "answer": " 188"}

However, the second part of the question gives a specific example of what is to be done with the cattle. In this part, the cattle is referred to as an \u201cit\u201d, so \u201ca\u201d becomes an improper choice as \u201cit\u201d indicates something unknown and should be used with singular nouns. \u201cthe cattle\u201d are the singular version of \u201canimals\u201d, and it follows a singular verb (should have been \u201care\u201d in this example) but is not the appropriate subject since \u201cwhy\" is referring to the farmer \u201cwhy they are used to keep/trap cattle.\u201d, which should not be referring to animals but rather the action of the lasso, and \u201cthese\u201d is plural, so it can be excluded as", "answer": " 810"}

Option E, show that the answer is 8 years from now. Explained in more details here:Corri is 3 years old, and 3 years later she will be 8, since 3+3=6 years old. \nThen 8 (3 years) + 6 (the year she will be 8) = 12 + 6 = 18, 18 years old from now.\nSo 3 + 5 + 8 = 16, 16 years from now.\n\n2. Option C, answer that the answer is ten. Explained in details here: First we calculate how old Corri will be 3 years from now and 5 years from now and 8 years from  now (which was our question). Corri is 3 years now so 3+5+8=16. \nIf 16 is the age 8 years from now, then 5 will be the age 3 years from now. 5+3=8. So this is the answer we were looking for.  \n3. Option A answer that shows how the answer is 13 years old.Explained in more details. Corri is 3 + 5 or 8, then we do 8+3(for how she is 3+5 years old) and then 11 then you subtract 8 the age is 3, then do 3+5 to see how old she is today, 4+5=9  and then just add.  9 + 3 is 12 and then you subtract 5 which is the 3 years old again.

{"text": "5 free throws. They keep track of their scores. Who would win the game? Explain how you determine who wins.\n\n### Answer: There are many ways to approach this problem. Some people would find a formula, others would make a probability calculation, while others would develop a strategy for how many throws each person needs to keep winning. Here is how I would solve this problem.\n\nTo start off, Reggie and his brother need to take 5 free thows. If Reggie wins $100 for every game he wins, then his brother needs to make more than Reggie to ensure he wins the game. So the brother has to make $100 more.\n\nWe don't know the game conditions beforehand therefore we cannot determine how many shots each person needs to take to win. We can only determine what each person needs to make to win. In this case his brother needs to make $105 to win the game which has never been played, or $114 for his older brother who has lost one game before.\n\nTo determine which brother is more likely to win, we first need to create a frequency table.\n|Player|Win Number|Win Amount|\n|:---:|:---:|---:|\n|Player 1|1|$100|\n|Player 2|2|$200|\n|---|---|---|\n|Player 3|3|$300|\n|***|***|---|\nWe can see the possibilities at this point, but not necessarily their probabilities. We have to determine the probability each player wins.\n\nFirst, player 1 has a 1/3 probability of winning. This is because there are 3 possible outcomes if player 1 wins: $100, $200, or $300.\n\nTherefore, player 1's probability of winning is 1/3.\n\nPlayer 2, has a 2/3 probability of winning or a 0.67 probability. 2/3 is the same as 0.67 \n\nWe now know that the game has a 1/5 probability of ending in a tie game. This is because out of 5 throws, the only time the brothers tie is if both players make $300: a winning outcome but a tied game.", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": "bles than jar A. How many marbles are present in jar B? Choices: A: 40 B: 32 C: 29 D: 14 E: 17\nRationales:\n1. \nThe question implies that we are presented with two jars having different amounts of marbles contained in them.\n\n2. Based on the knowledge provided by the question, the first jar will have 28 marbles and the second container will have the remaining amount of marbles over the first container.\n\n3. It is clear then that the second container will have less marbles by 28, since 28 is the amount of marbles located in the first jar. \n\n4. Since the second container will have fewer marbles, we can then deduce that the second jar must contain 12 more marbels than the 1st container, not less. Since 12 is greater than 28, it is the only option that can be true.\n\n5. Now, to solve for the problem we simply use the knowledge provided to us that the second container has 12 more over the first container, and thus it has 12 more than 28. \n\n6. \nThe second container will contain 12 more: 28 + 12\n\n7.

The question is \"\nIf Marley has > Em, what's the min # of Emily's marbles?\n2. To answer this, we can think of the problem in the following way:\n3. First, Emily has 6 marble, let's start with that.\n4. From there, we want to start thinking about what the minimum must be for Em to have MORE marbles than Mar?\n5. The easiest way to do this is to start with the question:\n\"IF Marley HAS more than Em, what's Em's min # of marbles?\"\n6. So, let's say Em has Y marbles and Marley has X.\n7. So, we can say if Em has Y and Marley has X, then what's Em' \"new\" number?\n8. \"Let's just say Em' = Em + Y = Em + M\n9. \"That's it.

One would have to show persistence or \"working towards their goal or purpose\". Giving someone up means no longer willing to put effort into it. Persistence means not giving up until one's goal is reached. Waiting would not be needed if one was going to give effort to get things done, even if it was not for a specific task.

He had to spend less time to do one subject A B C D\nRationales: Max took less time to do his subject homework for each subject by categorizing and dividing them into different sections. He took the same amount of time for each subject, which means he spent an equal amount of time on each subject, but by categorizing and divyinging the subject into different sections, he was able to save time. This is because, by dividing his homework by different categories, he could more easily complete the homework from each category, rather than doing everything at once and taking longer to complete each task.\n\n### Input:\"A man was having a walk in a park, where he saw a couple of kids doing homework. When he walked nearer to the kids, he found that they were struggling with their homework. They could understand the subject only if a teacher taught them.

Choices: 1. 3 feet A: 425 feet B: 450 feet C: 455 feet D: 460 feet E: 600 feet.\nOutput:450 feet\nRationales:1.This question pertains to calculating the total thickness of rock layers based on their average thickness and quantity of layers. \n2.In this scenario, each layer of rock is about 1 foot (12 inches) thick, meaning there are 25 layers in total. \n3.With 25 layers of rock that are about 1 foot thick each, the total thickness of strata would be 25 feet (25 x 1 foot), which is equal to 150 inches or 12 inches multiplied by 12 (1 foot).\n4.So, when considering average thickness, the sum of all 25 layers would be 12 inches (1 foot) multiplied by 25 (layers) or 300 inches. \n5.To find the total thickness of all the layers, we simply have to add 25 x 300 (the average thickness) in inches, which is equal to about 600 inches or 50 inches of rock.\n6.Since each layer is about 12 inches thick (1 foot), multiplying 50 inches by 12 will give the total thickness of each layer. \n7.When divided by 25 layers, this number will be the correct answer. \n8.This process is necessary to account for each individual layer\u2019s total thickness when determining the total thickness of a strata. \n9.Therefore, the correct answer is B: 455 Feet.\nAnswer: B: 454 feet\n\n### Input :Which of the following was not involved in the 1912-1913 strike at the Paterson silk mills?

A manager needs to make sure their employer is fully equipped to achieve their targets.\n\nTo do this, a manager needs to develop a management plan that outlines what each person on his or her team does. They also need to regularly review the team's performance to ensure the plan is working and that everyone is meeting their targets.

If there are 125 bottles and we assume that they are all different, then there has to be at least one green bottle. It is difficult to imagine all of them are green, so 1 is the answer. \nRationales:2. Let's first count the way it is said in the question (125 bottlecaps=48 green bottlecaps). So far, 125bottles/48green bottles=2.63. So, if 48 boltcaps are green, 72 must be missing. However the question says, \"he has 125 boltcaps\". Therefore, if he has 125, at least one bottlecap(the missing one) can be green, and this cannot be 72. We now have 48-72=(-24) bottlecaps that are green. (-24) is an exact answer and this is our first answer. \nRationale:2. If an additional 125 bots are green, then it will have exactly 24 that are not green. By the previous logic, 63 is an option. \nRationale:-125bottlecaps * 2120=30. So the answer is the same. \nRationale-2120-(-24)=2086-(-24)=1962. 1962*48=92784-92784=0.

So here is an alternative approach. We could eliminate the ineffective option by comparing our results with the second option. The rest options would be used as a check if the second option is inefficient. So we could rule out the first and third options by using the second option. This would only remain 4th and 5th options. If each option is multiplied by the second option, option 4 is the closest to the second option, it is inefficient because its decimal is too big, it is closest to the result we want(4.9 is very close to 5.0).

The question is about math, a field where we need to be careful about how we present numbers and fractions. The use of one, two, or three when talking about fractions in math can be confusing, depending on the context. In this case, it will be beneficial to make sure that we are using a consistent and clear method for presenting fractions.\n2. A: 1/3 indicates the fraction 1 divided by 3, or equivalently, 1/3. (One part of a thing divided by 3 equal parts of that thing.) This method of representation is often used to refer to one of three things.\n3. This method of representing 1/3 is clearly incorrect, as in the given question Yeon has three times as much as Gwi. (Three as fractions: 3/3, 3/4, 3/5, 3/6 \u2026 )\n4. C: 6/6 can be used as a shorthand for saying \u201csix times six\u201d because 6X6=36 is the number of items we are comparing. This is an example of how \u201cmixed number\u201d numbers are used in math to indicate multiplication or division by two or more numbers.

Choices: a: finding the slope b: finding the midpoint c: finding the y-intercept d: finding the equation of a line\nRationales: First, we can make a table with the possible answers:\n\n| Choice | A | B | C | D |\n| :--- | :--- | :---  | :---  |:-- |:---:  |:---: \n| Answer   | Math thinking |                                                        Math thinking\n| \n| 1  | a    : finding the slope b    : finding the midpoint c    : finding the y-intercep      | d     : finding the equation of a    :                                                        finding the equation of a\n\nIt can be seen from the table below that Tanika demonstrated an understanding of the equation of a line and therefore, the correct answer is choice B: finding the midpoint.\n| Choice | Explanation |\n| :---  | :----  |\n| A    | It is a mathematical equation and not a mathematical thinking. |\n| B    | Tanika used the line to find the midpoint of the table between two tables. Therefore, she used algebra to find the midpoint. |\n| C    | The equation of a line is dependent on the graph and not the table or the line itself. |\n| D    | It is not necessary to have midpoint and y-intercept to find the equation of a line. |\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question focuses on Tanika's process for setting up a table and tagging prices. It is clear that Tanika's first attempt failed because the table was too busy with prices to be easily identifiable. To solve the problem, Tanika moved her table to the left and used another table instead, resulting in a more organized and better displayed table.\n\nThe question asks for the mathematical thinking demonstrated by Tanika's decision-making process. Tanika used mathematics to find the midpoint between the two tables by dividing the total distance between the tables by two. This approach involves analyzing the", "answer": " 150"}

{"text": "up to 700 baby spiders, how many legs does each spider have?\n\n### Rationales:1. The question asks us to solve for the total number of legs the spiders would have after the eggs have been born.\n\n2. We know that a tarantula has 8 legs, and one egg sac can contain 700 baby tarantulas.\n\n3. Each tarantula egg has only one egg but it has been stated that one egg can contain many tarantula babies which can be counted as one and not as eight in the initial count.\n\n4. The question is then asking us to deduce the total leg number of the total number of babies, not the number of 8 legs, as this is already known.\n\n5. Based on the given information, we can deduce two things: (1) the babies would have legs in proportion to the mother(8 legs total) and (2) each individual egg would have a leg in the ratio of the number of eggs contained in it.\n\n6. Therefore, based on the ratios described above, one egg would contain four legs, one egg would contain eight legs, and 700 eggs would contain 2800 legs.\n\n7. Together, these numbers add up to 3588, which is equal to 358*10 or 8*462.5.\n\n8. So the total number of legs would be 3588.\n\nAnswer: D: 3588\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: If a tarantula has four legs, and one tar ant's egg sac can contain up 100 baby tarantula, how many legs does a spider have per body?\nRationales:\n1. The question implies that a tarantula's body has four legs.\n\n2. A spider's egg sac can have 100 baby spiders within.\n\n3.  Therefore, the answer to this question can be derived by determining how many legs a tarantula has to allow room to support 100 baby trantulas.\n\n4. If a tarantula' needs to support 104 extra legs through the birth of 100 babies, then the answer", "answer": " 32000"}

Choices: A. none B. 30 minutes C. 5 minutes D. 2 minutes E. 2 hours\n\nRationales: This question can be answered by interpreting it in such a way where it can be simplified into a series of equations or calculations.\nWe can start by observing the details given and form a hypothesis to set up our equation.\n\nThe question is based on the fact that it takes exactly 60 MINUTES to cycle 25 miles. (60 minutes = 1 hour) To work our formula, we will assume that Yolanda leaves every 30 minutes after arriving to her job; that is, she leaves either with or 30 minutes after the clock turns every hour. \n\nBecause of this, we know that Yolanda\u2019s return time to her house is 00:00, 00:30, 00.0:35, 00:40\u2026 etc.) and the time it takes Yolanda to cycle for 25 miles is 60 minutes. \n\nThe formula that we will use to solve this problem is:\n\n$$T_{return}=T_1+T_2+...+T_n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$T_{return}$ = arrival time (return time)\n$T_x$ = duration (duration of the trip in minutes)\n$$time=(T_x+a)\\times(1\\text{hours})+a$$\n\nWe then substitute our details and values into our formula and obtain:\n\n$$T_return=T_1+T_{2}=1\\text{hour}+[30\\text{minutes}(1\\text{hour})]=3\\text{hours}$$\n\nTherefore, she can leave at 03:00 or 03:30 (the next 30 minute period)\n\nThe time it takes to cycle for 28 miles is 60 MIN, so if she cycles there again (leaving exactly 30 minutes from home, and arriving 28 miles away), she will arrive home at 42:30.", "answer": " 15"}

To start, we can look at the cost of the items to see exactly how much money was spent on them. \nA. The bracelet cost 80 B. The two necklaces cost a total of 32 C. The necklaces cost 32 respectively \nThe bracelet, then, would be a $10 loss as 80 minus 70 leaves the bracelet as a loss, a negative, of 10. \nE. The bracelet costs $80, and the two combined necklaces cost a total $32. The bracelet was bought first and, with each necklace being a loss of 5, would be the $40 left over. \nHowever, one would need to account for the $10 spent on the bracelet to make this $30. \nThe answer is $10, as the $10 bracelet cost is subtracted from the $80 left with the remaining $30 going to the necklaces.\n\n### Input (2) : What is the total number of apples, oranges and pears in the basket on the table?

{"text": "sq. units what are the dimensions of a rectangle? Choices:  a. 4 and 2 b. 4.5 and 2 c. 4 and 4 d. no answer\nRationales: There are two main approaches to solving this problem: 1. a straightforward calculation, and 2. applying the formula for the area of a rectangle.\nFor the first option, you need to solve for the width, and then the length. We can simplify the problem by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:\n4*width = length ----> width = length / 4 \nWe then have 5*l = length so we know 4*width = (5/4)*length Now we just subtract 4 from each side to get width = (5/28)*length or width = 0.1865 length. Now we know we need to find the length to square off the side of the width we found from the area problem.\nOption B is 4.5 and so length = 4.5, option C is no answer since its width = 8 but length is 4. \nOption D is 10 x 4 = 40 sq units making length of 10\nAnswer: D: 10 sq.\n\n### Input:\"Most of the population in the world is in Asia\" is a declarative sentence.

The question asks the student to identify the correct mathematical operation that corresponds to this information.\n4. The correct answer in question C is'subtract'.\n5. Subtracting three-quarters of the lunch from one is the same operation as subtracting 3/4 from 1, or 3/4 minus 1.\n6. By this process, subtracting three-fourths (\u2154 of the meal) from one results in one and three-quarters (1.75, or \u00be), which is not the same quantity as the three-fourths eaten.\n7.

When people ask me what street is closest to the city of New York, they do it in a different way in that they are referring to New York as an area and not a specific point so when I ask you what is closer, I don't mean closer as in 5 miles but closer as in which place is closer to the point than the 5 miles or the 500 miles.

She knows that 25% of her students are not present today, and 10% of the rest attendance present (option B). If all of the students turn up to class, then none of them are absent. If everyone is there, then 100% are present (option C).\nRationales:\n1. Option A is given in the question but it isn't relevant to the current situation.\n2. Option B 25% is absent, 75% of the students are present (option B 1). 10% of those present is absent (option B 2), which leaves 65% present (option B 3) and 20% in total are absent (option B 4). \n3. To calculate the answer, we can combine the two equations (A + B) = C, where C = students present by using the rule of addition.\n4.

Most people would likely push or force the object to move or break the object to move it.\n\n2. It is unlikely that most people would use two different methods of moving an object because that would be unnecessary and require extra work.\n\n3. Using one method to try and move the objects would be more efficient and cost effective for those doing this task.\n\n4. If two different methods can be combined then that may work for some but not all situations since there is no guarantee that one method can be successfully combined with another for all objects and circumstances.\n\n5.

If the answer involves instruments, it is most likely the piano as it is frequently used in choir music, whereas the flute and violin are uncommon.\n2. The piano is a percussion instrument, meaning it uses strings that are struck to make sound.\n3. It is also a keyboard instrument, where the keys trigger hammers to strike strings to make sound.\n\n1. In the context of singing, 'the piano' is used to describe an unspecified or generic piano, and is therefore the most correct answer.\n2.

The first rounds have only two questions with simple addition. The second round has only two questions with simple multiplication. Lastly, the Hard round has only one question, using x = 5. 2. By the logic that round 1 and 2 are easy rounds, the contest can be divided into two rounds, i.e., Easy (1) and Hard (3). 3. The Easy Round consists of two questions of addition and multiplication. As we can have at most one question for each, and since there are already two questions in the Easy round, we can conclude that the second round, i.e., the Hard round has only two questions - one on addition and another on multiplication. 4. However, in the Hard round we have a question with x = 5, such that only one question can be asked, which is for multiplication, and thus Hard round can be either A: medium or C: hard based on the previous analysis. 5. As far as round 1 and round 2 are concerned, in the case we have 2 questions and we divide the contests into two rounds: Hard and Easy, by assigning any other round, say for instance Medium, we can either add another question in the Easy round or increase the number of questions in the Hard round. In both of these cases we can't arrive at any conclusion. However, assigning a Hard round with a multiplication question, i.e., Round 3 = Easy Rd + Hard Rd, we can conclude that Easy round has 2 questions and Hard round has 4 questions. 6. Therefore by eliminating any round from the above possibilities, we come to a conclusion that Hard rd has 4 questions. Hence, since there are either hard rd or 4 questions in the Hard round, A and B cannot be chosen, and they have to be eliminated. 7. The only two remaining answers will be C", "answer": " 38"}

Choices:  hours A: 0 to 12 B: 12 to 24 C: 24 to 36 D: 8 to 16 E: 16 to 24 hours\nRationales: The question presents a set of hours during which the donation telethoon is on, and describes the amounts of money raised during those hours.\n1. The period between Hours 0 \u2013 12 is during which John is able to raise $0.\n2. The period between Hour 12 to 36 has the highest amount of money raised, reaching the value of $30.\n3. The highest rate of monetary amount raised per hour is not given. \n4. However, when given a data point, we can see that during the period between Hours 12 to 16, the amount of money raised per hour is $9.\n5. Another way to think about this, is that for the first twelve hours, the amount raised in each hour is greater than zero.\n6. On the other hand, for the next 6 hours (12 to 18), there is positive increase in money raised per hour.\n7. As of Hour 18, the positive increase continues.\n8.

To host a party, she has to purchase items like drinks, food, music she likes. \n3. Betty buys drinks,\nfood, and music she likens from different stores. \n4. It is clear that in Betty's purchase of drinks and food, she needs to visit different stores to buy food in bulk and drinks and other food items in smaller quantities at cheaper rates because she doesn't want to eat the same menu.\n5. With this in mind, Betty is most likely to buy music at a supermarket because music is a common purchase and not every item is bought in bulk as other groceries are bought.\n6. A superstore like Wal-Mart would most likely have everything Betty might need during her shopping spree.\n7.

Mark has 87 cards**\n\n**2. Michael has 72 cards**\n\n**3. Lloyd has 66 cards**\n\nTherefore, if we can solve for the first 2 equations, we can infer the 3rd one, Lloyd has 66. \n\nThen, we have to solve for the 2nd equation, Mark has 87. \n\n**2. Mark has 8**\n\nThen, we infer the equation for Lloyd from the 2nd equation as he has 8 fewer than Mark and Lloyd has 66 more. Therefore, Lloyd has 74 more than Mark. \n\nLet's solve the 1st. equation that Mark has 87\n\n***87 - 66 == 87 - Lloyd + Michael + Mark***\n\nThat 87-66 has 8 more than Lloyd and Mark together have 87-8 = 79. \n\nSo Lloyd and the 2 of them together has 79. **66 + Lloyd + Michael**\n\nThat means, Michael has **9 more cards**\n\n*87 - 6 + 9 = 87-86 = 1 card, Michael has 72**\n\n**Michael together has 72 and Lloyd has 74**\n\nWe can conclude that Michael has 9 more than Mark and hence for 3rd equation, Michael has more cards then Mark, Michael has more cards than Lloyd.

B: 25% of the corn is same color on each square C: 56% of the corn is of the same color on each field. D:56% of the square is the same color. E:83% of the corn is from the same field.\nRationales: A: 83% of the entire field contains corn which is the same color. This is true for all the squares since even the squares that contain more corn than the rest of the field has still got 83% corn of same color. Hence, the amount of corn of same color on each square is 83/200 = 41.5%.\nB: The same reasoning as in Option A is true for this option too but because B talks about percent of field which equals total percentage (100%), instead of 200% (total number of squares and number of fields) which we used for A. However, the number of corn on equal amount of squares in field is equal to the total percent of all the fields. Hence, the amount is 13*112=1540/1750 = 88.3% (1540/ 1675)\nC: If each square contains more corn compared to other field then amount of corn of same colour in each square is 88.3/141 = 63%.\nD: It's equal to the amount of corn of the square as per Option C.\nE: If we divide the amount of same colour corn we find in whole field by the amount of corn that we find in each field, then percentage of corn of same colour becomes 83% as in previous statements.

The volume of a cube or rectangular prism can be found using the equation V=L x W x H.\n\nThe question asks for the volume of the box given some dimensions. It does not say that the dimensions are given for one particular box, but actually asks for the volume of a generic box that matches the dimensions specified.  So, the box we need to find the volume of will have both length and width of 10 inches, and the height of 8 inches.\n\nWe know this, and we also know that the height of the box is twice the length of the cube of 9 x 9 x 9 that is smaller than that box. We do not know the dimensions of the smaller box exactly, but it is small enough that all its dimensions are smaller than any dimension of the bigger box the volume of which is sought.\n\nSo, in fact, the dimensions of the smaller cubes the volume of which is known to be 80 cm\u00b3 correspond to only one of the five dimensions of the bigger box we must find. Hence, the dimensions of the box we are looking for equal to L=W, H=2, and V=12*8*2=192. \n\nThus, the correct answer is E. \n\nAnswer: E.

Choices: 1. 9 bags of flour 2. 10 bags of flour E. 7 bags of flour\n\n### Demostration:\n1. The question asks for the quantity which needs to be subtracted from the quantity already available at Hannah's disposal to arrive at the minimum/required/remaining quantity that can meet her demands. The answer has to be a multiple of the smaller of the two quantities (1 banana & 2 banana) required to meet the demands.\n2. The smaller quantity required to meet the demnd (1 banana) is less than the bigger quantity available (2 bananas).\n3. Therefore, the answer should be a number less than 1.\n4. In options 1. 9, 10, 7 bags of the flour can satisfy the demands if and only if 1.9, 10 or 7 bags are required.\n5. Clearly the number 9 is the only one in this set which can not be satisfied since only 7 bags of either 1, 2 or 3 cups can work. Hence the correct answer is 9 bags\n6. The key to the solution for this problem is realizing that 1 cup of mushed banana is equal to 1/2 of a banana. So she needs exactly half of what she needs for 2 bananas for 4 bananas.\n7. If Hannah could bring 10 bags with her then this would leave her with 2 bags left over if she has 2 bananas left which is not enough because it only amounts to 2/5 of a banana.\n\n### Input : You bought 4 tickets to the movies.

A: We can solve this problem using multiplication. We are given the given information: each bird eats 1 dozen beetles, each snake eater 10 bulls legs, and each fish eater 9 spider eggs. So we need to find _X_ such that _X times 12 birds times 10 snakes times 9 fish_ is equal to _12 beetles plus 10 bull's legs plus 9 spider eggs_  \nHere the answer is 10.\n2. B: This is also a correct answer choice B: 10 times 176 times 7 and 7 times 9 times 10 (The first line doesn\u2019t mean that the first animal can eat 176, it means there are 176 animals of that animal. Increase the line by 1) and the answer is 8.\n3. C: The first sentence says all the number of each day is given. And there are no beetles in the first sentence. So the total is 57 fish and we know one fish can eat 9 spider eggs, so we get 57 times 9, and the answer is 495\n4. D: The first sentence says that there are 5 birds, 12 snakes, 7 fish. To get one animal you multiply that number by another number. The total number of birds, snakes, AND fish is 78. So we have 78 fish in this problem because 1 fish eats 9 eggs per day. And 58 beetles.

Choices:  a) Red dot, White dot, Black dot b) White dot, Black dot, Red dot c) Red dot, Black dot, white dot d) White dot, Red dot, Blac dot e) Black dot, Red dot, White dot\nRationales:1. Nancy is looking for a specific book, The Hounds of Atherton, which has a red dot, a white dot, and a black dot. 2. The cart contains books that also have a red dot, white dots, and black dots, which means that Nancy can find the book she's looking for if she looks in order of color code, starting with a book with a red dot. 3. The second possible outcome is that Nancy finds The Hounds of Athers ton after searching the cart in the wrong order, starting with a book that has a white or a black dot. 4. If Nancy starts searching the cart in a different order from what is suggested, she will end up in a situation where all the books in the cart have already been searched. 5. Option c) is incorrect because the color order is only partially reversed. 6. Option d) is a result of completely reversed order. 7.

E: Yes\n\n### Analysis:\nInput: The question asks about a truck with a specific capacity (65 cubic meters) and two individuals - \"Stella\" and \"Twinkle\" - working together to fill it.\n\nOption B - Twinkle is filling at a rate of 45 cubic meters per minute which is 45/60 = 75% of Stella\u2019s rate of 45/30 = 150%. Stella\u2019s rate is clearly faster than Twinkle\u2019s if 30 cubic meters can be filled in 1 minute.\n\nOption D - The answer is Yes. Twinkle\u2019s rate will be faster than Stella\u2019s by 1-75=14.4%. So, Stella\u2019s rate will be 65/100=65/75.

So: $16 million dollars left. Let\u2019s say the first remainder, \u2018remainder of first remainder\u2019. Then the second remainder, which is half of the remainder, would be $(16 / 2).

And the value for a single plant would be 4 g/kg but we are not given a unit mass. Hence we can easily understand that the value that is mentioned is 4g/kg. \n\nTo find the calcium for a given mass of the plant the amount is calculated with the help of two equations. the first equation is the given one and to have 4 times more sugar using 8 units of calcium we can substitute it into the question as given to get (mass * 4). The 2nd equation gives the amount of sugar 6g when the plant has 1g of calcium. To find the amount of calcium per unit mass, we simply substitute 6g into our equation and solve it for the mass as given and will get 6g / 1g which is 6g. And so a correct answer would be $18g/kg$. \n\n### Input3", "answer": " 4"}

Choices:  a: 24 feet b: 13 feet c: 22.4 feet d: 14.4 feet e: 21.4 feet\n-Rationales-\n1. The question is a mathematical problem that asks about the distance between the pets.\n2. The pets are a hare and a chicken, both of which run at different speeds.\n3. The question asks how far away the chicken can be from the hare at a certain time if the pets have been released at different times.\n4. We can use the information in the problem to calculate the distance between the pests.\n5. The hare starts out 6 feet away from the chicken, and both pets run at different speeds (10 feet/second for the hare and 2 feet/second for the chicken). We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance.\n6. We can use the equation: (ha \u2212 ch)\u00b2 + (ch \u2212 c)\u00b2 = (ha \u2212 c)\u00b2\n7. Substituting the values of ha = 6, ch = 0, and c = 3, the equation becomes: (6 \u2212 0)\u00b2 + (3 \u2212 0)\u00b2 = (6 \u2212 3)\u00b2\n8. Solving for the distance between the hare and the chicken, we get: 500 + 6\u00b2 = 35\n9. From here, we can easily determine that the distance between the pest is 13 feet (rounded to the nearest foot)\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 13 feet.\nAnswer: B: 13.\n\n\n\n### Input-:Two friends had a party, the first friend had 24 cans of beer at the party and each guest at the party had 2 beers.

In this case, \"girth\" is a noun, indicating the width of the tree. \n3. A tree girth is measured (or calculated) with a tape measure, a tool that comes in many different sizes and is used to measure different things. The tape measure is a unit of measurement (1 meter), but the \"meter\" used in this sentence is not a unit of measurement; it is a noun used to designate the object being measured. \n4.A tree trunk is a stump of tree, usually including the roots, that remains after a tree has been felled.

Choices:  None of these.\n### Instructional objective: Answer questions about the relation between length and temperature.\n### Demonstra...\n### Demonst...\nRationales:1. The question is about the relation between length, temperature and water.\n2. To answer the question, we need to know the amount of liquid in a washing machine after a heavy and light wash.\n3. We can assume that a heavy wash uses more water, and therefore has greater volume than a light wash.\n4. If we are told that a heavy load of wet clothes takes 20 gallons for it to be full and a light load takes 10 gallons to make it full, then we would have all the information we need to calculate how much extra water is consumed in order to be full.\n5. To get the amount of extra water needed, we need to take the amount of water needed for the heavy wash and subtract from the amount of water needed to be filled in a light wash. This gives us an extra 10 gallons necessary to be filled in the light wash.\nThe correct answer choice is 10 gallons.2.The question is asking for 'how much extra water is needed for the machine to be filled.'\n3. When a machine is full, the amount of water is the same as the amount of water consumed for a heavy wash. We know the amount of water for a heavy load is 20 gallons.\n4. To find 'how much extra water used' for a light load, we have to subtract the amount required for a heavy load. The amount of water required to be filled for a light load is 10 gallon.\nThe correct answer has to be 10 gallons as we know that a full machine takes 20 gallon of water and after 10 gallon of water has been added to the machine its volume becomes 30 gallons.

When you buy a single unit of cable that is 1000 ft long, you can split it into exactly 6 units of cable of equal lengths.\n2. So, 1000 = 6 x 20 feet, and you could use the equation 1000/6 = 20 to find the length of just ONE of the cable units.\n3. However, in the question, only 6 of 1000 cables are used. You buy 1000, use 600, and have 400 left over.\n4. So, you can use the equation 1 + 1 = 2 to find the length of 2 of the cable units. Therefore, 2(1000/2) = 600, so each of the remaining 200 will be 200/2 = 100 ft long.\n5. You can also use the equation 1 - (2/6) = 2/6 to find the length of another 2 cable units, which would also be 200 ft long. Finally, you could use the equation (1000-600) / 4 = 200/4 = 50 ft for another 2 cable units.\n6.

So, there might be a possibility that use of two devices might be related and hence sales between two devices is compared.\nRationales:1. The question states that the store sells 50% of their PC accessories to laptop customers. \n2. So, if a customer only purchases one product, they are far more likely to purchase a laptop rather than an accessory. \n3. This information indicates that laptops are more popular among customers than the accessories.\n4.

{"text": "enough, what is the height? Choices:  C: same as Barry B: 5 feet A: 6 feet D: 7 feet E: more than 7 feet\nRationales: We must use the two numbers and information in the given problem statement to solve. The question is asking about the height of the branch or tree in relation to the height of each person, Larry and Barry.\nConsidering the question\u2019s context that gives us the heights of the two people, Barry and Larry and the fact that each person\u2019s height is needed to determine the height of the branch, we can rule out answers B: 5 feet (Barry\u2019s height 5 feet) and answer D: 7 feet (Larry\u2019s height 7 feet).\n1. Considering that each person\u2019s contribution will be needed to find the height of the branch we can conclude that this information is redundant and irrelevant, these numbers can be neglected, thus answer options B: 5 feet and D: 7 feet can be discarded.\n2. As we work towards solving the problem statement we realize that we have not been asked to find the height which is different from a question that asks us to find the height of either 1 person or the average height, the problem statement is asking for the height of the branch/tree. The question is asking to find what the branch or tree is.\n3.

Since she is working at a market, she probably wants a sound effect that emulates the sounds of the market itself, such as barking dogs, car horns, or even waves.\n3. Option D: waves, is not a sound effect that would typically be used in an ad, as it is more related to nature and the ocean and sounds more like an ambient noise rather than a sound effect.\n4. Option C: wind, is not a sound that would be commonly used in an ad and does not match the description of the intended sound effect as it is more general.\n5.

{"text": ", her husband will walk 2 miles.\n\n### Rationales:\nIt's safe to assume that Carlotta doesn't sing for a whole hour. This means that the total time Carlotta will spend singing on stage can be stated as T = 1+7 (where 7 is the number of minutes Carlotta might sing).\n\nFor every minute that Carlotta spends singing, her husband will walk just 2 miles. This means that\n\n\\(2 \\times 7 \\times T=1+7 \\times T\\)\n\nand we can simplify it as\n\nT (singing time) =1+34.\n\nNow when Carlotta sings for 2 hours and 10 minutes, her husband will walk\n\n\\(2+34 \\times (2 \\times 7)\\) which can be simplified as \\(80 \\times (2 \\approx 30)\\) or 2400 miles in total.\n\nRationales:Start by determining what the question is looking for. The question wants to know how long Carlotta sings during her final performance.\n\nAssess the information provided in the sentence. The sentence says that every minute she sings, her husband will walk two miles.\n\nRewrite the formula using symbols to keep track of the numbers. We can assume that Carlotta will not perform for an entire hour. If she performs for x minutes, then that\u2019s approximately x minutes, so we replace x by 1 + x.\n\nAssess what equation will provide the answer to the request. Use substitution to figure out how many miles Carlotta\u2019s husband will walk.\n\nRationalize the solution and make it more manageable. We will substitute the values, and then solve for T. Notice that 2 is constant, so we won\u2019t need to replace in any formula. The number of miles that Carlotta\u2019s spouse will walk can then be written as 2 (T + 2).\n\nSimplify the equation to obtain a manageable answer. T + 2 is equal to 34 (5 T + 1).\n\nRationalize an answer that is most likely, if not definite what the question is asking.

E: The amount of money Mike earns after three years is about eight times more than Fred's average salary for that three years. F: Mike will eventually earn the same amount of salary as Fred.\nRationales:1. Here, the question states that Mike earns 10 times more than Fred'5 months ago.\n2. If Mike's salary is increasing by 12% per years, we can use the compound increase formula to work out how much more Mike will earn, relative to his 5 months ago salary.\n3.

Choices: A: 10,20,3 B: 9,20,4 C: 10,17,5 D: 10,07,8 E: 10,40,2\nRationales:\nA farmer has twice the number of pigs as he has cows. This means that there are 8 pigs for every 5 cows. The farmer has 10 pigs, but twice that is 30 pigs. Also, The farmer has 5 cows and added 2 pigs to his cattle, giving a total of 7.\n\nThe farmer has 5 dogs but has 5 fewer cows than pigs, so they must have had 4 dogs. Thus, he has 1 less dog than both cows and cats. As a result, he still has 7 dogs.\n\n\nAdding the pigs and the cow gives the farmer a total of 10 pigs and a total of 8 cows. Thus, the total number of pigs is 10, the total number of cows is 7(b), the total number of dogs is 7(a) = 42 = 10 + 4 + 2 = 10, and the total number of cats = 4.\n\nThe total that contains these four numbers is 10, 4, 2 7 = 40.

D: The rainfall stops E: The rain is over\n\n### Demostration:\nIt is clear that the problem is about \"raining\", as the question talks about how it rains on the 7th Day. \n\nWe are also told that in the 1st-3 Days, the rainfall per day was 4, implying a rainfall total of 12 inches (4(1)+4 (2)+4 (3)) = 12 inches. \n\nWe also know that in days 4-7, the rainfall was 2 inches per day, implying a total rainfall of 8 inches (2(4)+2 (4)+2 (4) +2 (1)) = 8 inches. \n\nHence the overall rainfall for the 7 days is (12+8) inches = 20 inches. \n\nThe rainfall is always a positive value. \n\nHaving established these points, one cannot answer option A, the rainfall will be '0 inches' because it is physically impossible for the total rainfall to become 'zero' when we add up two consecutive sets of data to find total rainfall.  \n\nHence, the answer is: E: The rain is **over**\n\n\n### Rationale for Answer:\nIt is also impossible for the rainfall to \"stop\" on Day 7 if we consider the days of rainfall to be consecutive days, as the assumption is that the rainfall will continue indefinitely, and no information is provided that suggests the rainfall will stop on Day 7.

{"text": "decide to share it so that they can afford more gifts. They each pick a different number between 1 to 10 and multiply them together to get a price. What number should they choose?\n\nThe statement presents an anagram of numbers 1-10, where each friend will pick a number, from 1-10. The task is then to share the cost of the gifts among the ten friends so that they can afford to buy more gifts. As per the statement, the gift price depends on the numbers chosen by the friends. Therefore, the task is to determine the price of the gifts.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The gift price depends on the number chosen by each friend.\n2. Each friend needs to have equal shares so that they can purchase more gifts.\n3. The task therefore is to determine the gift price based on the numbers chosen by each friend. \n4. From the given numbers, the value of each gift depends on whether it is less than or greater than 7.\n5. If a gift chosen by Friend1 and Friend2 is greater than 7, then the price increases by 4, therefore, 9358.\n6. If a gift chosenby Friend1 and Friend2 falls between 1-7, then the price does not change and is instead at 1059312.\n7. If a gift chosenb Friend1 and Friend2 does not fall between 1-7 then the price does not increase.\n8. In the context, to distribute the cost equally among ten friends, 1059286 is the price we get.\n9. Thus, the total cost of all the gifts is Rs.65000.\n10.

Houston travels at a speed slower than their speed by 30 kilometers per hour. Write an expression that represent how long they were at home.\nRationales:1. We can first find how long they were at work by starting from time and subtracting the speed. \n2. Kimberley was faster than Ela, and so Kimberly would reach 10:46 before Ela so Kimberly has to spend more time away from home.\n3. Kimberley's total time was then 10:40 + 50/60 and Ela was 10:41 + 45/60. So Kimberly was 1h and 40 minutes home and Ela was 1h and25 minutes home away from their job. Houston was there for (1h and 45).\n4. Houston was faster than Ela but not faster than Kimberly so they had the same total in time.\nRationales 1. There are two ways that are used when solving the expression. The first thing to do is to find how long the group was at the workplace.\n2. First we add up how long Kimberly's job was which was 10:36 + 30/60 = 1h 25 minutes and Ela's which was 10 (Ela is faster than Kimberly ) = 15 minutes. Houston's is 12:48 + 30/30 =15 minutes.\n3. The total of them are all 1:20 which is done by adding. So the job place is 20 minutes.\n4. The second approach is to add up the speed of each member of the group and then divide the total speed by the same amount to get the total time.\n5. Kimberly's was 50/6\n6. Ela's was 45/6\n7. Houston's was 75/\n8. The total is 155/6 = 25.83\n9. So if we calculate the total amount of time that is spent at the job. That", "answer": " 13"}

Which choice do you think the boss is more likely to do? Choices:A: Throw Frank in jailB: Give Frank a raiseC: Firing FrankD: Fire the boss\nRationales:1. Frank wants to meet his quota at work for the sales.\n2. They only have 4 hours to meet the quota.\n3. Frank calls in sick and the boss catches him at home being lazy.\n4. The most likely action that the boss can take:\n      1. is to fire the boss for allowing the employee to be away from work the whole time and also for trying to cover up by pretending to be sick.\n      2. or:\n      3. to fire Frank for being lazy while being on a salary.\n      4. Hence, given the constraints and Frank\u2019s actions, the option A: Throw Frank in Jail is most likely to happen.\n5. But there is a problem with the option A, although the boss is likely to fire the lazy person but he is more likely to give Frank a raise because Frank tried being lazy while on a salary. So options B, C & D can also be considered.\n6. Also, the boss will never throw Frank into a jail or fire him from the job. It is unlikely to happen.\n7.

To arrive at a straightforward answer to this question, consider the situation of choosing 10 books. Then there is a probability of 0.1 (or approximately 10%) of finding all or more than 10 you are looking for.\nIf you do not find any books, you cannot find more than.  If you do find some books, the probability of finding more than is 0.4.\nAs mentioned, to compute the probability of not finding more than, you have to multiply the two as follows: 0.1 * 0.4 =\n0.04.\n\nThere are 230 choices in all in 1000 books, which is 60% of 230.\nThe probability of finding only 10 books is 0.06.\nSo, 0.04/(0.06*0.84)=0.4, the final answer (less than 1%).\n \nAnswer: B: **0.4** < **(less than 1%)**\n\n### Solution:\nThe probability of choosing more than or less than 10 books from the", "answer": " 736"}

The options provided do not help us figure out where the family should sit in the musical.\n2. Option B: center section makes the most sense; this is because the center section is closer to the musical event, which is where the performers are going to be performing.

Tropical storm with sustained winds greater than 74 miles per hour.\nC. Storms of lesser force such as tornadoes.\nD. Sustain tropical strength in mid-latitudes.\nE. Sustain wind speed in excess of 74 miles per\n\n hour.\nRationales:\n1. Hurricanes are violent storms that occur in tropical regions, while heavy snow and high waves generally do not occur in tropical weather. Therefore, option A (heavy snowfall, high\n\n waves) is the correct answer.\n2. Tropical storms with sustained wind speeds greater than 74 mph are hurricanes by definition. Hence, option B (tropical storms with sustain wind speeds greater than\n\n 56\n\n mph) is the incorrect answer.\n3. Tornadoes are small-scale storms that occur on the surface and often in association with thunderstorms or hurricanes, but they are not the most important characteristics of\n\n hurricanes per se. Hence, tornadoes are not important features of hurricanes and they are not relevant for the question.\n4.

The answer should be'stocks' the shelves with new merchandise, not stocks the things.

The initial context provides the base rate of one-way ticket (2dollars), so 30-day ticket must have at least 30x$2= $60.\n2. A one-way ticket is always cheaper than a 30-days pass or a 3-day pass(since a 3-day ticket costs $6), so only options A,D can be eliminated. \n3.

B:I don't know C:I found them behind the couch D: I found them in the closet E:I found them in my room\nRationales: The statement begins with the word \"your\" which means we are addressing a particular person who has a cat which is used as the subject of the sentence \"your cat disappeared to\"? This clearly leads us to the inference that the person has more than one cat.

In the statement, it is clear that a portion of Fred's allowance was used to purchase movie tickets.\nD is also incorrect since \"the house\" here refers not to the literal house that Fred lives in but rather to activities that he participated in at home.\n\nThe correct response therefore is E, D or both D and E. D states that \"Fred spent half of [his] allowance going to the [movie] tickets, he earned extra cash, [and] helped [out]\"\n(1) \"out\" is a verb referring to some action Fred took while at home. Since \"help\" is an intransitive verb, it is impossible for it to receive an \"out\" as a direct object without it becoming a compound verb. To summarize: help is what Fred did, Fred helped.

Let's assume that each person takes a shot. Thus, the total shots of vodaka remaining is 4 shots (4*8/3). \n2.  Since each person drinks one shot, total shots drinked by the people is 1 (2 shots).\n3. Since total shots of vodia available to drink are 4 (4*8/2) - 1, total shots of vodnka available to drink is 3 shots (i.e. 4 - 1 = 3). \n4.

Choices: 0.01 33.33 83.33 0.67 0.90\nRationales:\nAs you apply a discount of 10% to personal computers, the discount for each personal computer would be $90. Therefore, the discount on all personal computers is the total amount of the discount multiplied by the number of the item.\n|Discount on personal computers| |=$90 \u00d7 4 |= |$360 |\n\nThe discount for smartphones is 12%.

The question is about a walking distance covered by Clover, a hypothetical character, in a day. \n2. To find out the total distance walked by Clover in a day, we need to add the two walking distances stated in the question, which is 3 miles (morning walking) + 3.5 miles (evening walking) = 6.5 miles.\n3.

Doctors are paid very limited is wrong, as they are paid very little.\n2. There are not any difficulties in finding a clinic as they are open late at night.\n3.

Those rides would require an adult guardian since each of them would require a child's parent to be present to provide the necessary support. However, the Ferris wheel does not require an adult guardian (Choice A), which is why it is not included in the options.\n3.

What do good grades indicate about a high school transcript?  \n\n### Rationale of Answer: \nBoth grades and standardized test scores are means for assessing student potential. Since both work on the same concept it can be concluded both are indicators for assessing students potential. However the question directly asks \"does it indicate about a student's potential college experience? So this statement was directly answerable.\n```\nStill the SAT score is directly related to the college admissions exam since these two are compared so this statement was also directly answerable.\nA student's ability to handle college workload is heavily based on their grades. If you have a low GPA, you are likely going to have a low test score even if you spend hours studying. \n```\n\n## Input (instructions not directly answerable):   \nThe best way to achieve a positive self-image is through positive emotions, a positive social environment, personal beliefs, and _.

We are already told how many books she bought. She bought 6 paperbacks and 4 hardbacks books. We therefore only need to find the number of the left book/books she bought. (Not the name of the book, not the material used (i.e, paperback books vs hardback books but the number of books.\n\n1. Sarah bought 6 paperbook books.\n    a) This doesn't make sense if 6 number of books are already given.\n2. Sarah purchased 2 paperback books. (this makes sense in the question)\n    a)  From the sentence in the instruction in the statement Sarah bought and bought. This makes a total of 8 books, this is in line with the instruction that says  \"bookstore Sarah bought and bought.\" So the sentence 2 paperback books makes sense and it should be an option.\n        i. Sarah bought 6 and bought 2 paperback books\n6 + 2=8 books are bought by Sarah.This is in line with the sentence at the instruction.\n    b) We can see that 6 + 4 = 10. So Sarah bought a total of 10 books and she bought 2 paperback book, which means she purchased 2 out of the 6 paperback books. The number of hardback books Sarah purchased is therefore 4 minus (2) the 2 paperbacks she bought which equals a 2 paperback books which was not included in the initial choices. This means that the last option should be 2 paperbacks, 4 hardbacks and 2 paperback.\n    But the second option makes no sense.\n\n### Input:\"There are 9 apples in the box.

He decides not to go because:\n* 1. The show would be too expensive as he has to buy a ticket to this show that he likely doesn't really want to see.\n* 2. If he buys a ticket, he has to get it in advance which creates unnecessary logistical demands that are frustrating and impractical and he's already late for work.\n* 3.

There are 80 dogs (i.e. original dogs & the new dogs created) and 60 cats in total. \n2. Hence option A and option D are incorrect as the options have incorrect count of dogs and cats. \n3. Option C is incorrect as it has incorrect count of original cats and dogs. \n4. Option B and E has incorrect count of new cats and dogs.\n5. This question can be solved mathematically by: \n6. New cats - original cats Original dogs - new dogs  (1) (2) Number of pets =  Dogs  -------------------- (t+d) Cats  -------------------- (60-80) \n7. Which gives us C = 35 dogs and 25 cats (i.e. total number of pets). Increase in Cats -> (d/C)(B) Increase in Dogs -> (C/t)(E) \n8. Since C * D >=3.782, we can safely say that the increase in cats is more than the increase in dogs. (Option B). A decrease in Dogs of 20% -> (35)(0.8) < (3)(0.2) Hence 35 - 3 = 32  New dogs added in 9:45 to the Compound -> (1.5) \n9.

There are two parts to this question. The first part is to determine the daily gain. The second part is to use the answer to the first part to solve the profit equation.\n2. The answer to the first part is D, which means daily gain would be 25.\n3. The profit equation needs to be determined based on three variables: profit, price, and quantity.\n4. Let\u2019s first find the two variables (profit and price). There are four possible combinations that add up to 960, so there is only one variable (profit) that will not appear in any of these possible combinations: 1. $960 = ($40\u00d725) 2. $960.00 = ($40.00\u00d725)\n5. Since we can eliminate profit, we know the remaining two variables must be price and quantity.\n6. The second equation we need to solve will only have two variables, price and quantity: 1. $40.25 = 960.2 / 103 2. $920 = ((96,667 \u00f7 103) / 5)\n7. We can see that in the first equation, price is in the numerator and quantity is in the denominator of the fraction. In the second, quantity is in the numerator, while price is in the denominator.\n8. Based on this information, we can see that we need to divide the profit by the quantity instead of the price so we can correctly answer the question.\n9.

{"text": ", Stella saw dresses of varied pricing. If Stella decides to buy a new dress, what do you think would be the cost of the dresses? Choices: A: high B: low C: medium D: low-medium E: average\nRationales:\n1. The question pertains the price of the dresses that Stella saw and wanted to buy.\n2. The \"varied pricing\" mentioned earlier suggests that the dresses are priced differently from each other. It's therefore important to consider the range of prices and the number of dresses when determining the costs.\n3. Option 'high' would suggest that the dresses were very expensive and thus, it doesn't seem to make sense with the question context.\n4. Option 'low' also seems to be an inappropriate option for the question context. There is no mention of pricing, which is an important factor of the question.\n5. Option'medium' is a possibility, but there is no mention of the number of dresses that Stella sees, and thus the answer cannot be medium.\n6. Option 'low-medium' is an interesting possibility as it implies that the dresses in-question are located somewhere between low and medium. It requires further thinking to narrow the range of prices that could apply to different dresses.\n7. Option 'average' describes the price most commonly seen, which would be the average, but the question didn't mention average prices, so we can't rely on the common expectation of average and eliminate it.\n8.

The statement talks of two lakes\u2014Lassie Lake and Lake Crystal, and the context also suggests that we are calculating the number of frogs in Lake Crytal based on the relationship of frogs' population in Lake Crystal as compared to Lassie Lake.\nSo, the question we will be asking is: \nGiven that Lassie Lake has 'x' more frogs than Lake Crystal, how many frogs does Lake Crystal have?\nIf we re-order the steps and make the context in a logical sequence, we are able to ask this question in a more simplified form:\nGiven that Lakes I and II have 'x' more or less frogs than Lake III. How many frogs does lake III have?   \nBy definition, one cannot have less than fewer frogs or fewer frogs than fewer frogs. Therefore, we can safely assume that the expression 'x' must be a positive value, and thus, we can eliminate all the negative number values for the answer choices.\nThus, we can rewrite the question as:\nGiven that Lake I has 'x' more or fewer frogs than lake II.

Each stripe has a number on it.\n2. The number on each stripe is a three-digit number.\n3. The number on each of the stripes is different.\n4. As such, we know from the question that each number is unique, but we do not know what those three numbers are.\n5. To answer the question, we must calculate what the answer is for the three digit numbers on each stripe, then add those answers together to find the total. \n6. Option A: 9 is only an option if the three digit numbers on two stripes are 6 and 3, respectively.\n7. Adding the number on the first stripe (6) with the number on the second stripe (6) and the addition will not result in 9, but rather 12 (6 + 6).\n8. If we follow the same logic for the other two stripes, we will get 6 + 3 = 9, which is not the answer to the original question.\n9. Option B: This response is incorrect because the three numbers from the stripes are not 6, 2, and 7. This could be the case if the numbers are 2, 2, and -1, but as we don't know what the numbers actually are, this is not the correct answer.\n10.

How long before she can spend it all for her wallet?**\n\nRationales: In this task, the user is asked to solve a problem where Betty has saved $16 for a wallet that costs $100 dollars. The user must determine how long it will take her to save the remainder $40. To calculate how long it will take to save $40, the user must find the fraction of $40 she can save in each day or week or month, then multiply those amounts by the number of days, weeks, or months until she has enough. \n\n### Input-answer pair\n\n### Solution:\nThe correct answer to the problem is: 0.25.\n\nRationales and Solution:\nIn this problem, Betty saves about $16 each month and her new wallet costs $160. Her new wallet will be ready to buy in 10 months.\nFrom the question, we can determine two things. Betty has enough money but Betty is not ready yet. Second, Betty saves money every month until her new wallet is ready. \nFrom this, we can see that the correct answer is 10 months since Betty needs 10 months to save enough money to buy the wallet.\n\n\n### Instructions:The pendulum showed great balance.\n\n### Solution\n\nThis solution is not appropriate.\n\n### Explanation\n\nPendule is a mass which swings or oscillates from side to side when released.\n\n### Input\n\nClarifying questions to ask:\n\n1.

{"text": "year ago, the same laptop would have cost $1000 but it's now over $100, due to inflation. Is $1000 a good price to pay for this laptop? Choices: 1000:A. No B. Yes C. Not sure D. Abstain E. N/A\nRationales:    1. Inflation happens when the economy is in a recession or depression. In this situation, it is very unlikely that Tara can get exactly the same laptop in the past that costs the same amount. The price varies and is usually never the same.\n2. Tara is probably buying a newer model of the same laptop than the one that is cheaper, so it will cost more if she buys that same model.\n3. Even if the price of the exact same model is lower, it could be more than $1000 on other models but less for this specific model so maybe the laptop is worth it if Tara feels that it is worth buying.\n4. Inflation can be a bad price to pay for this kind of product and that depends on how much higher the inflation is compared to the price of the product.\n5. A lot of things can happen with inflation so it won't make sense to assume that inflation is the only thing that happens when buying a laptop.\n6. Finally, as we all know, it's not a matter of choosing a single option, Tara should assess herself if she wants to buy the laptop.

{"text": "mates. What fraction represents how much of every pie he got? Choices: 24/3 72/3 48/3 96/3 36/3\nRationales:\n1. Fractions are equivalent to each other if they have the same numerator and different denominators. \n2. Therefore, the correct fraction for the scenario is 24/3. \n3. This is because Manny got 3 sixths of every pie, so the fraction that depicts how much he got from each pie is 3/6. If we multiply this by 3 to get how much he got from every pie, that gives us 3/6 \u00d7 3, which reduces to 3/2.

Choices: 0 or 1 0 or 2 0 or 3 0 or 4 0 or 5\nRationales: The question asks what the last digit of a number divisible by 13 will be.\n\nA divisor of a number is any number that yields no remainder when it is multiplied with the divisor. The last digit of a number is the digit that is located at the rightmost place of the number once it is written in scientific notation.\n\nThe only positive divisors of 13 are 1 and 13 itself.

{"text": "4 cards in it. How many cards does he buy in total?\n\n### Demostration:\n1. The task, as described by the prompt, is to calculate the quantity of cards John buys based on the context given.\n2. To begin, it is important to note that the word 'buys' in the sentence, suggests that John would have acquired the cards by purchasing them.\n3. This information can be inferred from the sentence by considering that a person would not buy 10 packs unless they had the money to purchase them.\n4. Additionally, it can be inferred that the quantity of packs John buys indicates that he bought enough cards to last him for a prolonged period or complete a project.\n5. This is further supported by the fact that each pack contains 24 cards, indicating that there would be 240 cards total in 10 packs.\n6. The context also gives us an insight into the type of magic cards that John might buy, namely'magic' cards.\n7. This suggests that he might be purchasing a type of card game or a collection of trading cards, as these are often referred to as'magic' cards in the gaming community.\n8.

{"text": "ashells and 13 were broken. The next day he got 5 more seashells but none were broken. Then he lost 12 seashells. How many seashells did he have at the end of this week?\n### Demonstation:A) I am confused. I couldn't follow the question step by step. I am thinking about the word 'broken'. What if one was broken the other day when he collected the shells?\n\n### Answer:\n\nRationales:Input:A collection of shells is given. Ali has a seashell collection. Ali started his week with a total number of 180 seahells and 13 of them were broken. The next part of the question states that he got 5 more shells after that, adding up to a total of 185 seashells. The question moves on. A seashell gets lost during the week, indicating that 47 were left. The last statement says that the total number of seashells was 185, so the answer is 141.\nAnswer: B: 141 seashells.\n\nInput:Alice looked at the water. She saw an object in it, so she took out a spoon to take out the object in it. She found something inside the object. She picked it up, but something else fell out.

{"text": "take a trip to India.\n\n### Explanation: The problem statement provides necessary context for answering the following question:\n#### What is the combined age of them?\n### Demonstraion: First, we should figure out what the ages of each of the individuals are to solve the problem. The answer to that question is 16, so the first age is 6, and the second age is 10. The question then asks about the combined age of the people. We know that these two ages combined (the people) equal the answer to the first part of the problem (ages of people). This gives us an equation of six plus ten equals fifteen. This would be solved by using standard mathematical operations as in the question (16-6-10=16). It can then be understood that the answer to the question is 16. \n\n### Expected responses: The expected responses to a test question often include mathematical formula solving in context of given situations. For example, a math equation such as -2x=6 can be applied to solving the age problem.\n\n### Solution:\nInput 6 and 16\nsolution 2x=6 (add 4 to each side)\nsubtract 2 from each side, divide both sides by 2\nsolution  3x=3 \nsolve for x  x =3/3 =1", "answer": " 74"}
{"text": "In what ratio does one gallon of milk cost $ before it is sold? Choices:  B: 2:1 C: 5:1 D: 4:3 E: 3:2\nRationales: The question involves finding the ratio of $2 per gallon of milk when it was initially sold for $3 per gallon. To determine this, we must first understand the units of the given question which can be found in the question itself. $3/gallon = $2/gallon\nThe ratio of $3/gallons and the ratio of $2/gallons are related and we can establish a new ratio of $2/2 and then $3/3. This would be the first step in order to draw a conclusion from the question.\nIf the question could answer directly from the given ratios, it would be an option for the answer (B: 2:1).\nSince the given ratio doesn't lead to a conclusive answer, it is the only option that is not related to the question. The answer is then (E: 3:2)\n\nAnswer: E: 3: 2\n### Input:Which is less: \u03c0/3 or \u03c0 times the circumference of a circle with radius 9? Choices:  C: \u03c0 times the circumfence of a circle with radius of 9 D: \u03c0/3 E: 35 D: 3\u03c0 times the circumference E: \u03c0 times the diameter\nRationales: In this question each unit is measured against \u03c0. (\u03c0/3) = 5/18 or 30.051/18 or 1.666667, so it is smaller than pi times radius 9. Then the option D: \u03c0/2 or 0.25 is taken as the next unit of measurement, the diameter is equal to 2 times the radius, so then it is less than 9 times \u03c0/2 or about 3.140617. Then we would take 3\u03c0 to be the smallest unit of measurement in this case as it is equal to 9 times \u03c0. So the answer is (E: \u03c0 times the radius)\n\nAnswer: (E: \u03c0/3)", "answer": " 8"}

This question involves planning and scheduling of work according to a specific timeline.\n2. The bike messenger needs to cover a total of 16 deliveries in a short period of time. This is to be accomplished in two slots -- 8 deliveries in the morning, followed by 8 deliveries in a later time frame.\n3. Since the limit is 2 hours, it is not practical to divide the two slots into individual tasks. However, the total number of deliveries can be divided into smaller amounts.\n4. The messenger can deliver 4 packages in 30 minutes, since it takes 8 deliveries/ 30 minutes.\n5. She can then deliver 4 more packages for her last slot in the next 20 minutes, since it would take 8 deliveries within 20 minutes.\n6. Therefore, she needs to deliver 8 boxes and 8 boxes in two sequential time slots for a total of 12 deliveries within 2 hours.\n\nAnswer: A: yes\n\n### Input : How many months are there between July and March?

Lisa bought some t-shirts which were 50% off, so its clear that the t-shirts were at $50 per unit. Then, since Lisa pays $40, we can take 40/50 and we get 0.8 which is close to 0.8*.2. This tells us that Lisa bought 8 t-shirts.\n2. Carly bought some jeans which were 30% off, so Carly could have bought some jeans at 46$ and paid 30% of that, which lets us say that Carly paid 14.4$.\n3. 30% of 46 is equal to 14.4, so Carly purchased 3 pairs of jeans. Also, since she needs to pay $22 she multiplies it by 3 and she does get the answer 67$.\n4. If you take 14.4 out of 50 you get 1/3 so the options that are not possible are F: 1: 6 and B: 3: 2.\n5.

{"text": "away $50, how long before Susie has $300 in her pigg bank? Choices:  E:15 months A:10 years B:6 months C:7 months D:15 years E:12 years F:13 years G:14 years\nRationales:\n\n###\n\n1. The problem states Susie has $20 in her bank and needs to put $50 more in order to reach total value of $300.\n2. As Susie has $250 and she is putting $50 more in, she will have $300 after 350 days because 350 (value of $50) is less than 350 (total value of $250.\n3. The problem statements also indicates that Susie has pigg bank and not a bank, hence it might be possible that she might take away some of her savings before adding the $50 back.\n4. As such eliminating the options that give value of $0 and negative values to $200, we can say Susie had a pigg bank with value of $20 as opposed to a bank with value of $0.\n5. There are 10 options and we are only dealing with 6 months to 14 years, so 10(6 - 14) = 32 possible answers.\n6. If Susans pigg bank has value of $205 at the start, she might take away $50 or lesser but she will add at least $45 as 50 is divisible by 7 - number of days in 6 months.\n7. If Susans bank has value of $195 at start, she might take more than $50 or less in case she will put in more than $50.\n8. The answer choice that does not work is D: 15 years. The value of her pigg bank after the $50 addition is not divisible by 7: the piggy bank will have to have value divisible by 7 only if it has started with value of $255 or $245 if a negative amount from pigg bank to $200 is taken out.\n9.

{"text": "3 more dimes than nickels. If he has 7 quarters and 5 dimes,how many total coins does he have? Choices: 1. 24 2. 14 3. 34 4. 11\nRationales: The question is about a coin collection where Ravi has certain specified amount of quarters and dimes.\n\n1. Since Ravi has more dimes than nickel, we can determine that Ravi has exactly 7 quarters and exactly 5 dimes.\n2. We know also that Ravi has 2 more quaters than nickels. If we subtract 5 from the number of quarters (7) we get 2.\n2. Adding 2 to to 7, we get 9.\n\n3. Ravi has 3 more dimes then nickels. If we add 2 to 5, we get 7.\n4. Since Ravi has 9 quarters, and 7 dimes and there are 10 dimes per dollar, he has exactly 9 dollars.\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe have 2 more quarters and 4 more quarters than nickel. Therefore, we add 2 and 4 to 7 and get 9.\nRavi has 3 more nickels than nickel therefore we add number of dimes with number of dimes he have and subtract nickels.\nThus, Ravi have 9 dollars.\nRavi has exactly 7 coins and exactly 4 nickles in total.\n5.

The question involves the sum of weights of two hands.\n2. The first part of the question is the body that will use the plates.\n3. Body is the person who will do exercise.\n4. Tom is the person who is doing the exercise.\n5. Summation of weight of Tom's hand using 20 weight plates each with 30 pounds means 2*30 or 60 pounds.\n6. Summation of number of weight plates of Tom's left hand is 7*40 or 280 pounds.\n7. Summation of both the weights gives 280 pounds from right hand and gives 280 - 60 = 220 pounds from the left hand.\n8.

{"text": "never been to the airport before so he didn\u2019t know where to park and he walked around in circles. How did he find his car?\nRationales:1. The question mentions that Nate got lost looking for parking in the airport lot. The question also asks how he found his car.\n2. The car is Nate's primary mode of transportation, so it is likely that he has left his car in the parking lot previously.\n3. Therefore, it is most likely that Nate parked somewhere else or found it in another location.\n4. One should analyze the question in the context of the problem statement. The problem states that Nate is lost in the parking lot.\n5. He cannot find his car initially, hence he is lost in the paraking lot. Later in the question, the text describes Nate's eventual realization and it also provides a hint that he found his car in a different spot from where he initially parked.\n6. Nate must have found his car after walking around in circles, which implies that this is somehow related to parking in a new space.\n7.

When they come home and sit at the dinner table, what will they taste better to jill because she ate all the bigger and ripe apples and therefore she will taste better because she eats better.  Choices: A: Jack B: Jill C: none of these D: Jack and Jill \nExplanation: Jill and Jack are eating dinner at the table, with the smaller basket that Jack has containing unripe apples and the larger basket that Jill has.\n1. The question asks us to determine which one tastes better -- a person with a larger basket of ripe apples, or a person with a smaller basket of overripe apples.\n2. In this case, the person with the larger basket of ripe and good quality apples will taste better than the person with the smaller basket of overripened apples -- option D.\n\nRationales:1. Ripe apples are juicer, plumper, and sweeter than overripe apples, and they therefore have more nutritional value and a more satisfying overall taste.\n2. Eating too many ripe apples will likely lead to discomfort or indigestion, whereas discomfort related to over-eating overripe apples is not as likely.\n3. Even if you eat a smaller amount of high-quality, nutritional food, your tasting buds will still report that food as being good and satisfying, while overripe foods are not.\n4.

To show how tall is Parker, we need to determine how tall Daisy is. Daisy is talle= 2 feet and 1 inch. Parker is taller than Daisy by only 1 inch as she is 4 inches shorter.

This implies that\nhis initial balance of 236 needs to be 236\u221218 = 218\n3) However, Fred's change in balance is 218\u2212218 which is 0\n4) Hence, from the previous two sentences, we get the relation (s)\u2212(t) = 0 which can be expressed as the identity ax+by\u2212az=b\n5) Based on the initial case provided, we have n=6, a=218 and b=23\n6) Let x be the number of books that Fred buys\n7) Therefore the resulting function expression must be x+218=23\n8) From here on, the following substitutions will be made for clarity in reading:\n\n9) Taking x to be 6\n10) Taking a to be 218\n11) Taking b to be 23\n12) Finally we will write the equation as follows:\n( x+218)\u2212(23)=0\n13) There the number of books Fred buys can be found by\nsubtracting 23 from 713 to get 680. \nSo, the function representation for this problem would be\n\nInput: What number has an infinite amount of zeroes?

Choices: A: 1 & 2 C: 1 & 4 B: 2 & 3 E: 2 & 5 D: 2 & 4\nRationales: We can exclude answer to get a new basket because a new basket isn't necessary to solve this problem.\nIf Martha has a basket of berries and a basket of heavy cream and she doesn't have all the berries she needs, she doesn't need a new basket, she needs to take cream out of the basket. \nThis way, for the first basket of berries she has, she now has two extra berries and one missing, as that's what she needs. \nSo if she needed two berries, she would now have two berries. \nThis is shown by saying that we could put 2 cups of the remaining berries into the first bucket and the rest into a second bucket. \nThis will be her extra berries. \nThe berrys from the basket are not her extra berries because she used those in the first bucket. For the second bucket, she needs 2 cups of cream. \nSo just take half a cup from every cup of cream and you now have 4 full cups. \nBecause she can take cream from every two cups, she always gets the right amount of cream.\nTherefore, she can just put 2 cups into the full bucket and the other 2 in the half bucket. \nAnd she gets 4 cups of pie fillig \nAnswer: 2 & 2\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following mathematical question\n\n### Demostration:\nInput:  The question asks, \"What is 10 + 50 + 20 + 7 + 30 + 8 +", "answer": " 20"}

Bobby travels on city streets as many short routes as he's needed to complete his tasks. Bobby's truck is fast, so he can do a lot of trips in a short amount of time. Bobby goes to as many pick-up points as possible to do at least two trips per day. Bobby saves time.\nRationales:1. From the text, we know that Bobby has 12 hours to make his deliveries and he also wants to make these deliveries in as few trips he can.\n2. This means Bobby needs to make as many of these trips together as possible to save time. So, Bobby must be either going between pick-up points on the same street multiple times in a single trip or from a different pick-up point on same city route to get as many trips in as quickly as he can.\n3. Since Bobby can only make his deliveries in 12 hours. We know that Bobby cannot complete more than 12 deliveries in just one shift. Hence, from the text, we can infer from the first given inference option that Bobby plans his trips so that he can complete maximum trips in a single shift\n4. Choice B: Bobby travels on city streests as many short routes as possible - This also makes sense because Bobby needs to make most of his deliveries in the city and the city has a lot of shorter streets in them as opposed than longer roads (example a road that starts at a city boundary and ends at the other boundary of the city)\n5. So, he picks a street that has lots of short route options and then travels to as many pick-ups possible near each other so that he saves time on the route so that he can do more deliveries in less time\n6. Choice D: Bobby goes to pick-ups points as much as he can to do at least 2 trips a day- Since the shifts are 12 hours long and the truck cannot exceed 100 mph, it is going to be very difficult to go to more than 20 points in the city if they are not close to each other.\n7.

The calculations are as follows:\nNumber Of Boxes Seth Has: Calculated from the data given: Seth had 10 boxes of oranges, he gave 4 boxes to his mother and 1 box to his baby sister. The amount of oranges he had left is 5. Now he only has 9 boxes remaining. Therefore, Seth has 9 boxes left and he had a grand total of 10 boxes.\n\n### Rationale: In this case answer C is the most obvious and correct answer.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "work tote. If it takes 2\u00bd times longer for Karen to walk from her station to the supply closet to pick up a project bag when they are at the office than it does for Kevin, how much heavier is Karen\u2019s project bag than Kevin\u2019s? You must provide your work using integers. Choices:  A) 3 ounces B) 4 oz C) 4 oz D) 6 ounces E) 7 ounces\n\nRationales:1. The statement provides us with two pieces of information. The first is that Karen's tote bag is twice as heavy as Kevin's tote bag. The second is that it takes her 2\u00bd times longer to walk from her station, pick up the project bag, then walk back to her station to complete her work\n2. Since the first statement tells us the ratio between the sizes of their tote bags, we can use this information to solve the second statement. Remember, the length is in a ratio to the width, so if the tote bag is twice Karen's weight, then it must be one half Kevin's weight.\n\n3. We can rewrite this as 2/1 = 1/H, where H = Karen's work bag weight. Since we already know that H = Kevin's bag weight, then H = 1. This tells us that Karen's work tote bag weight is 1/2 of Kevin's.\n\n4. Now that we know the weight is 1/4 the weight of Kevin's, we need to also convert the time difference to a time ratio. Remember, the \"time ratio\" is the number of times it takes Kevin to make the walk to the supply closet, pick up the project, and walk back to his seat. By using the ratio between the weights, we know that this ratio must be the same as the ratio in which takes Karen to do the same task. If Kevin took 2\u00bd times as longer to do this task, then it must take Karen 4 times as long to do the same thing.\n\n5. Since both the weight (1/4) and time (4) are whole numbers, we can simply find the product of these values and round down. 250. Therefore, the answer can be the rounded down value of 250.", "answer": " 2"}

While Nurse Missy is free to eat anywhere she wants within the hospital, it's more rational to eat at a designated area that the hospital sets up for food preparation and consumption for the medical professionals and staff.\n2. This type of designated area is known as the hospital cafeteria or simply a hospital cafeteria.\n3. Eating at a desk or anywhere within her ward would be inefficient and could disrupt the workflow of patients and staff.\n4. The same can be said for eating at the nursing station, which is typically responsible for administering tasks or work that require a nurse's attentive presence. \n5. Therefore, eating at her ward or desk would not be ideal choices.\n6. The remaining options can be ruled out due to being too complex to find or inefficient to use for a quick break from a long shift of caregiving. \n7. For this reason, the most ideal place for lunch would be the hospital cafeterium.\n8.

To answer this question, the readers should find out how many buyers are there in grocery store today. And how many buyers are in the same grocery store yesterday.\n3.  Consider the answer choices. Answer choice 'A: More buyers in the store than yesterday' is a false statement. The statement contradicts our claim, as the text informs us that there are '40 more buyers', which indicates that the number of buyers increased.\n4.  Answer choice 'B: Fewer buyers in store than yesterday' is also a false statement. The word 'fewer' means 'less than'.\n5.  Answer choice 'D: At least as many buyrs as in the store yesterday' is also a wrong answer. The sentence doesn't explain what is the number of buyers in store yesterday.\n6.  Answer choice 'C: The number of buyers did not change' is the correct answer for this question. The text contains 'More buyers in the store yesterday' which is correct.

Solving Algebraic Expression is the process of simplifying an expression with letters and mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n2. To solve the expression, we need to simplify it so that the numerator and denominator are both simple numbers by canceling out any common factors.\n3. First, let us factor out the greatest common factor of the numerator and denominators.\n4. Since 6 and 13 are common factors, we can factor out 3 and obtain 4 \u00d7 3.\n5.

The 2/3 distance can be thought of as a fraction and represented as 0.67 or 2/3. \n2. For the next calculation, we need to recognize that 0.67 means that for every time 0 runs, we want to run \nd, which is 2/3 of d. \n3. Therefore, if 0 runs and we add 0+0+d, we get a total of 2 or 0.67 miles.\n4. However, this is not equivalent to the question.

{"text": "ig out of it. Do you think the wig would be too short? \n### Demonstatation:\nInput: Calvin has been saving his hairclippings after each haircutt to make a wigout of it. Do youthinthe wig would be too short? \nRationales:1. The term 'haircut' is used to describe a haircut performed by barbers or hairstylists, implying that Calvin's hair has been cut by these professionals. The context indicates that the hair has been trimmed, leaving behind only the ends or tips of the hair. To turn these hair clippings into a wig, Calvin will need to use a chemical process to untwist or detangle the hair and remove any tangles or knots from the hair. This process is known as wetting and combing the hair.\n2. The term 'wig' refers to a human-made hair substitute or extension worn by people.\n3. After combing the hair carefully, the hair clippings are washed in order to remove any remaining tangles and knots. This process is known in the wig industry as washing the hair.\n4. The final step in making a wig out of the hair clippings is to dry the hair, which can be done by using a hairdryer or air-drying the hair.\n5. The wig can then be styled to achieve the desired look for the person wearing the wig.\n6. Therefore, from the given context, the answer is yes, the wig would be short. The length of the wig would depend on the length of the hair clippings donated by Calvin. The clippings could be 1-2 inches long, but it is unlikely that they would be 6 inches long. This is because the length of the wig will be limited by the length of the hair donated by Calvin, and it's unlikely that this hair would even be long enough to reach 6 inches.\n7. This answer can be deducted using the 3 steps of the problem-solving method, namely, problem identification, hypothesis generation, and evaluation. First, the initial problem statement is identified as 'Calvin has been saving hair clippings after each hair cut to make a wig'. To solve this problem, we need to identify and evaluate the given information before", "answer": " 80"}

Choices:  ocean streams A: rivers B: oceans C: clouds D: rain E: ground water\nRationales:There are mainly 6 different ways that water comes to the Earth's seas, which is known as ocean. There are two forms of waters known as freshwater and saltwater. Ocean streams are the fresh water streams which come from the glacier at the ground level which is called surface run off. There is a cycle of water also that is known as hydrologic cycle known as evaporation, condensation, precipitation and infiltration of ocean. The water that is collected at the surface then absorbs the sunlight and goes over the clouds as ocean water vapors. It is because of this that the clouds give the rain. Also the rain gets into streams known as ground water which is later flowing into the ocean.\n\n### Output\nOutput: All the water that enters the water comes from ocean streams which are freshwater streams and surface runoff which is the form of the river or glaciers.

The limit for the number of pieces of luggage allowed per person on the plane is 5, and after checking in one person discovered he had more than the allowed pieces of luggage, so he won't be able to travel.\n3. How likely is to this situation happen, given that the total number of people traveling is 6 and each person is allowed to carry 5 pieces of lugguage?\n4. To answer this question, we can consider the proportion of people who are above their number of allowed lugguage.\n5. There are 6 people in total, and each person is allowed 5 pieces of lugugage. After checking in one person learned that they had 6 pieces of lugguage, so the question is how likely is it that this happens.\n6.

The ratio of one person having more than the maximum number of lugguage they are able to carry, while still including 5 other people who can travel with the correct amount of lugguage, is 6: 5.\n8. To calculate how likely it is for one person to have more than the maximum amount of luggage they are allowed to carry, we will divide 6 with 5 to create 6: 5, and then multiply by the proportion of the number of people traveling: 6:5 180.

D) What else she bought besides the horseshoe? E) What else she bought?\nRationales: The question is asked of the items bought at a garage sale, therefore we can assume that each item was sold individually as opposed to being sold in one large bulk.\nTish bought 4 items, which means that she only bought a red horseshoe.\nThe word \u201chorseshoe\u201d means a metal horseshoe, and it is commonly used in horse racing, so this is the horse in the blackjack (horse + race) game.\nWe can conclude that Tish did not buy anything similar to the following items: a purple horseshoe, a horseshoe necklace, and a horseshoe ring.\nWe can deduce that the mug is a coffee mug based on the word \u201cmug.\u201d On the other hand, the bracelet is a yellow bracelet based on the word \u201cbracelet.\u201d\nThere are many possibilities for the horse mug.\nWe can conclude the answer to this question because there are no other items listed on the question, which is likely why the question was asked.\nBy looking at the answer choices, we can find a number of questions that can be answered based on all of the information provided.\nWe can see that the word \u201citems\u201d is bolded, because it is in the question. It may be helpful to think of how to solve for such answers.\nTherefore, it seems more likely that the horseshoe is a horseshoe, but we would need to consider other questions that do not have the word \u201citems.\u201d\nFrom the answers:\n1) How many items did Tish buy? - Four items\n2) What can she use for the bracelet and the mug? - Coffee mug, bubble gum, and gummy bear\n3) What else did she buy besides the horseshoe. - A red horseshoe\n4) What else did she purchase? - What else did she purchase.\nIt does not seem as though she bought the horseshoe because it was missing, or that she bought the horseshoes", "answer": " 6"}

Choices: A: exercise B: improve mood C: create an app D: get fit E: reduce fat\nRationales: Terese wants to improve her health by increasing her daily activity, which means using one's energy efficiently in the process. An app is a software package for a mobile device, designed to enable new possibilities in terms of technology, but doesn't sound like something meant to improve one's health. Therefore, she wants to exercise more, improve mood, get fit, and reduce fat. These are all potential ways to improve health. Choice D: create an app might be true as well, but it is specific and seems out of scope for what Terese is trying to do in terms of her health.

Let x be the number of stickers Clara has left.\n2. One way to create an equation for x is to subtract the remaining stickers from the total number of stickers. This can be written as:\n`x = 100 - (9 + 7 + 6 + 5) = 100- 27= 73`\n3. Another way to create an equation is to multiply the number of stickers she initially has left by 3, then subtract the given amount her best friend, brother, and teacher received. This can be written:\n`x = (100*3) - (10*1) - (9*1) -- (7*1) -- (6*1) - (5*1) = 300 - 10 - 9 - 6 - 5 = 210`\n4. There are two methods that led to two different answers. Option A shows that 53 are left over, option B shows that 38 stickers are left over, option C shows that 35 stickers are left over and option E shows that 90 are left over.\n5. Clara has more stickers left over by the method that does not subtract the number of stickers distributed and then multiplies the remainder by 3, which gives more stickers left over than subtracting the number of stickers from the total then multiplying the remainder by 3.

There are only 2 options that give you 30 minutes, but the patient wants the medicine in 30 minutes after the time the doctor asked him to take it, so the doctor must ask the patient to wait 30 minutes after 30 minutes, which means 30 minutes after his first dose he must then take the medicine again. This makes option B incorrect for the same reason (if it was 2 doges instead of one, that would make more sense). Option A is correct because it's exactly 30 minutes after he takes it, so he only needs to take medicine, and then he takes it again 30 minutes later, which is the exact same time he would need to wait after the doctor asked him to.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input 1: There are 24 books on the shelf.

Choices: 1.50 A: 2.00 B: 2.50 C: 3.50 D: 5.00 E: 6.00\n\n### Direction:Answers the following question.\n\n## Rationale: 1. The first step is to identify the units of the given items, which are pieces of candy. \n2. One candy equals one piece. Therefore, the price of each piece of candy is equal to the price of a box. \n3. After identifying the units, the next step is to find the total number of different types of candies.\n4. Since there are 10 pieces in the box, each of which is a different type of candy, there are 10 different types of candies in the box. \n5. After finding the total number of types of tally, the next step is finding the price of five pieces of candy.\n6. There are ten types of candy in an entire box. The box contains 5 pieces of candy, which means there is one piece from each type of candy. 7. The total cost of 5 pieces of different types of candy from the box is equal to the cost of 5 boxes of the same type of candy.\n8. Since we are given the price of one box, we can determine the total cost of two pieces of the same type of candies.\n9. Since each of the 10 pieces is an entirely different type of candy but equal to the size of a box, each piece should cost 3.50 because we are taking from the equation (10 boxes) / (5 pieces of candy), which equals 2.00. \n10.

Choices: A: bread B: dog biscuit C: cheeseburger D: cat biscuit E: salad\nRationales: Option A: bread will not make up the whole of the dog\u2019s meal. It only forms a part of the entire meal. That means dog\u2019s favorite meals are D and E. The other options will be too small to include in the meal. Option B: Dogs and cats like to eat dog biscuits and cat biscuits, respectively. However, a dog would prefer to eat a cheeseburger than a dog biscuit. Option C and D are similar to option A. Option E: A dog will get the entire salad, and a cat will get the entire cheeseburger.\nOption E might look more plausible, but it still would not fit in the question. If a dog ate an entire apple, it can eat an entire salad later. But that might take a very long time for the dog, and it would not be in good shape if it had to hunt for its food. An apple would be enough for it, while the cat would find an apple too small. In option D, a cat eating a whole banana would be too large and difficult for the cat to consume. In this case, the question seems to imply that both a dog and a cat eat the whole thing. Hence, the overall favorite meal of the dog in this question is a cheeseburger. Option D might seem to fit best, but it is very difficult for a cat to eat an entire cheeseburger all at once. They would need to eat it gradually.\nOption", "answer": " 30"}

Although you can add vegetables and fruits to salads, smothies, and soups, this particular question refers to different styles of cooking. \n3.

This means that she bought as many red as she did blue, and then combined them. The two quantities are equal, so by combining them, we're doubling the quantity. So on July 10 we should have the same number of candles regardless of their color. We can either say that we have twice as many left to light candles. Or we can choose an alternate way and say that the one group represents 100% of the colors. With this second explanation in mind, we can simplify the algebraic expression, as follows: \n\n$$2x+2y=20 $$\n\nwhich is equivalent to: \n\n$$x+y=10 $$\n\nRational 2: As the number of candles is doubled, the result is a combination of red and blue. So we can either say that we light two red candles (since we have twice as many) or light 10 of one color (1 red and 9 blue).

Jack and Jill share the cost of renting the cottage, meaning they each pay an equal share of the total cost. \n2. Let's divide the total cost of the cottage ($500) by two to determine how much each person must pay (answer choices B, C, and E). \n3. When one person alone rents a cottage, the total cost for one person is $500. However, when two people share the cost of rent, the total cost is $1000 (assuming an equal split for each person).\n4. Then, divide $1000 by two to obtain our answers for choice B (1000$ / 2 = 500$). \n5. Similarly, in order to calculate the total cost for three people to share one room, the figure for two-person (500$) is multiplied by three, as three people share the same total cost of 1500$(2 x 3 x 500 $).\n6. Therefore choice A, $250, is one person's cost, choice B, $200, is two people sharing the cost, and choice C, $300 is three people sharing it.\n7.

Starting with the first option, Lily has $55 in her bank account.\n2.  As the next line has 7 and not any positive numbers, we can assume that she spent the whole money on a shirt. \n3. And that means she got the 7 dollars back, so she starts off with $62.50\n4. The next 4th line has a positive answer of 5. \n5. This means we can assume that she used some more money from the $62.5 to buy it and then return the rest of them.\n6. This means $55.92 = $62.5 - $6.58 \n7. And this means that we are left with $6.58\n8. The last amount of money we are given is 45 for lunch. \n9. That would mean we can assume that she bought something worth $39 for lunch.\n10. We divide $45 by $39, this gives us the total expense. And we divide the rest with 1 means $2 is the left with us. \n11. This means we get the answer as $2.58. \n12.

It does not specify what 100 out of the 600 pages of the Book.\nLet us assume that Coral started from page 1 of 600 page book and finishes it.\n1. The task given here is how many pages did she read after she finished reading 100 in the book.\n2. We know 100 pages + total pages = 600, we can reduce to a simpler question. 600 + total pages = 1000.\n3. We need to reduce the total pages into unit. 1 page = 5 unit = 500, the total page then = 1001, 2. We need to count up one hundred.\n4. She read 100 pages out of the 1001 page.\n5.

{"text": "at $30 per book. What is his percent of profit? Choices:  i) A: 68% ii) B: 63% iii) C: 133% iv) D: 7%\n\nRationales: The question states Jack buys books at $20 price and he sells them for $30 price. The question specifically shows profit of $30 that is 10 dollars difference from his buying price.\n\n1. Percent of profit is calculated with the formula Percentage = ((Profit/price of item)/100)\nBy the formula, percentage is $(30-20)/20)*100 = 33%\n2. But to make sure it is right, we can convert it in to normal percentage(i.e. 1%)\n$\\frac {33}{(30-20)}$ = $\\frac {33/10}{-10}$ = $\\frac {3/(30/10)}$ = $\\frac 3{1/3}$ = $\\frac 1{2}$ = $(100*1)/2 = 50%$\n\n3. According to the question Jack's profit is $36 which is $6 more than $30, so that's $6/(36-30) = $(6/30)*100$ = $(6/10/100)*100) = $(0.6)/100$ = $(\\frac {6}{100})%$= $60%$\n\n4. According to the answer, profit is $68 which is $18 more than $50(Jack's buying price), so that's $18/(50-30) = $ $(52-30)/(80-30)$ $ = $ $(22/60) * 100$ = $0.367$ = $36.7%$\n\n5.

Two kinds of apple are present in the garden. 'Sweet' and'sour' are 2 kinds while the correct answer is 8 times. Only one of these can be correct. 2. 8 is the 'times as many' multiplier. Any choice that does not represent 8 (e.g., 5), can be ruled out. \nOption A: 4 can be eliminated, as it would be a multiple of 8 (e. g., 8) as in the given question but it would be the wrong multiple 'times'.\nOption B: 2 is possible though not preferred as the question suggests the quantity can be calculated but it gives a very specific answer of 8.\n\nRemaining Choices: 1. 48\n2. 28\n\nHence, the given answer as to be 48. 48 can be arrived at by multiplying 8 by 6 (two times the 'times as many').\nAnswer Choice A is incorrect.

E: Cannot determine\nRationales: If we look at the statement and number of options provided, we can immediately determine that the answer has to be one of the four multiples of $10 (see below).\n1. The statement says \"Sandra was paid USD 20 more than Amy\", so the sum of money needs to be increased by $20. Now, $20 is a multiple of 10 (it is 2 * 10).\n2. The second part of the statement says \"Ruth was paid USD 5 less than Amy\". Thus, the sum of money needs another adjustment of $5 to become equal to her \"pay\" so we can conclude that \"Ruth\" share needs to be reduced by $5 from the original \"pay\". Therefore, the two \"additional\" adjustments are worth $20 and -$5 respectively.\n3. It should now be clear that if the \"pay\" is equal to $A (A being any of the multiples of ten), then Amy's share is $A - (A - 5) = $A + 5 which is equal to A + $20.\n\n### Inputs: If you were to have a party for 1 year olds, what type of food would you serve?

{"text": "with only $20 remaining. Ivan wants to be able to purchase sufficient feed so that he can feed at least eight birds for a period of 2 months. Ivan bought feed for 1 month each time and wants to be able to feed birds for at least 2 months for $20 remaining. How? Choices: 1) A: Buy feed with $1 for a month 2)$B: Purchase 4 cups of feed (each cup containing $5 worth of bird food) 3)C: Purchase 6 cups of feed (containing 2 cups and a half)\n4)D: Purchase 8 cups of seed (containing a whole cup and eight thimbles)  E) Purchase 9 cups of seed (with 8 cups and 5 halves)\n1.The question can be simplified as one that asks Ivan to figure out how much birdseed can be purchased using the amount of money remaining.\n2.The first and immediate question then would be how many cups of birdseed can be purchased, given that the remaining 20 dollars can only be used to buy 1 cup\n3.One cup of birdseed can be bought for 5 dollars, and so we know that the maximum amount of birdseed that can be purchased is 4 cups.\n4.Ivan can take this as a variable, since 8 birds require a minimum of 2 months worth of feed - he needs sufficient birdseed to last for at least 200 days\n5. 8 birdseed will be bought in each subsequent month, so how many cups of seed are remaining by the last month can be represented by the following equation:8(cups of feed each month )- birdseed left over after each month= 8(number of cups).\n6. Since 8 birds require a month worth of feed between each birds, we can assume that there are 2 months worth of birdseed in each cup, and can therefore set the equation to: 8(cups) = 2*(0.5).\n7. Solving this simplifies to  4(cups) =2, meaning that a total of eight cups of feed will have to be purchased before the birds are fully fed.\n8. The answer is therefore 4 cups for the first month, 4 cups the second month, 1 cup the third", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "has three fewer chips than Lina. How many chocolate chips does each girl have?\n\n### Inputs-How many chocolate chops does each girl have? Viviana =5 Lina = 2 Susana =?\n\n### Demostration:\nRationale:\n> The task here is to determine each girl\u2019s chocolate chip amount. As there are three options for the answer options, you\u2019re expected to do three independent calculations. The instructions then ask you to find the total. The girls have different amounts of chips, though no two will have the exact same amount. There are no missing pieces of data. So, the trick is deciding on what to do for each girl, and then how to add the solutions together. Let\u2019s do the arithmetic first. Viviana has five more than Lina, but she has three less than Susana. So the trick is to remove three chips from Susana, add five chips to Lina, and subtract the five Lina gets, from what Viviana has. The trick is getting down to the same number of chips for each girl. If you\u2019re still lost, let\u2019s add some more context. Let\u2019s take Susana first. She will get three less than Lina. To get there, we remove three chips, and we will add five. Lina and Viviana will remain the same until we subtract the five that Lina gets from Susana, which leaves us with the same number of chocolate chips for each girl!

The question asks us to determine the number of quarters Winston has left after he spends half a dollor (0.50) on something.\n2. The value of quarters is relevant to this question as each quarter has a value of 25 cents and therefore, any amount in quarters can be represented as $0.25, to match the dollar sign.\n3. The value of the 1/2 dollar is relevant, since the total of the 1/4 dollar and the 1/2 equals 2/2 ($0.40). This is not a valid representation for 12 quarters, which cannot be rounded up to more than 12.\n4. 14 quarters equals $3.50, which is greater than the original value of the 12 quarters before spending the 1/2.\n5. Option A: 11quarters is not a valid representation of 14 because 11 is rounded up to 12, meaning there is one extra/leftover quarter.\n6. Option B: 10quarters is not a valid option because 12 + 1/2 cannot be rounded to 12. Therefore, there would be quarters left over.\n7. Option D: 9quarters is an invalid option because it does not represent the correct amount of quarters left after 1/2 is spent on something.\n8. Option E: 7quarters is also not a valid option because, given the value of the quarters and the sum of what Winston has before spending the 0.50, option 7 would mean that there are still 2 leftover quarters which is not an accurate representation of what Winston would have left.\n9. Hence, the correct answer is A: 11quaters. Option A: 9 quarters is the only valid option in which 1/2 has been subtracted from 12 (leaving", "answer": " 300"}

Choices:  A:: no B: some C: tons D: all E: none\nRationales: The question pertains specifically to the \"2 fruits\" from each tree that they \"produce\" a collective 20 fruits. \nSo, to figure out the total available fruits, this question must be answered as follows:\nStep 1.

There are 40 percent of the quarters behind Nick\u2019s feet, so the answer is C: 40 percent.\nC: 40 percent cannot be expressed as a whole number and not a fraction, so the answer is D: 40 percent as a fraction.\nD: To find the answer to the question, subtract 2/5 from 1.\nE: In the answer choices, only 5/3 equals less than 2/5 and is thus incorrect.\n\n### Input\nHow is the following problem represented in your graph?   \n1.10    \n0    \n5    \n3    \n6\n\nAnswer: \n\nInput\nHow far did Irene travel in the opposite direction from this point? Choices:  In one direction A  In two directions B  In a straight line C In a right triangle D In a 180 degree turn\nRationales: In this case, Irene travelled in the direction of the negative coordinate and away from the origin. Therefore, Irene traveled in a direction opposite to the one indicated by the positive coordinate. Since the negative coordinate can be interpreted as a direction, the correct answer is 'in the opposite direction.' Note that the answer choices 'to the right of' and 'to the left of' can also be interpreted as 'in the opposite direction from' or 'in the same direction as the positive coordinate.'\n\nA: In one direction: Irene travels towards the origin.

{"text": "these straws to dogs. He had 4/3 of the remaining straws left. How many straws did not feed the dogs?\nInput: The question asks Troy for the number of straws not given to dogs.\n\n### Strategy:We can first express each quantity as decimals using division.\n\nDivision: $300\\div 5= \\frac{300}{5}:=60 \\div 3= \\frac{60}{3}:= 20 \\div 4= \\frac{20}{4}:=5\n\nHence, all of these decimals of straws can be used to feed to the dogs. Therefore, the straws left will only be fraction parts of what was initial.\n\nThe question asks about the remaining amounts for not feeding the dogs. Therefore, \nthe total available, 60+20+5=85, is less than the initial, 300. Hence, the 35 units remaining are divided among the dogs and we have 15 left for Troy.\n\n### Soln:Hence, Troy had 35 straws left not fed to the dogs.\nThe answer: B\n\n### Comments:\nWhen you have to do division or multiplication and have the option to do with the fractions or decimals, it is always profitable to write the first one using decimal value. Decimals often come handy because they are much faster to work with than fractions and do not have extra operations like adding or subtracting.

Since this is a compound question, this means we should break the $750 into a number of 10 classes which allows us to break it down to $75. This $75 is added to $75 to make $150 for a total of 10 classes. Then the total value is then divided by the total number of classes which is 10. The solution is simple. It'll show you that it's $7.50, which was chosen. The first answer is $7.50.

What is total amount of money Grace made? Choices: A: $14 B: $16 C: $20 D: $24 E: $32\nRationales:1. Grace charges $6 an hour. With this knowledge, the number of hours she works multiplied with the rate of $6 results in the amount of pay she receives.\n2. $6 x 10 = Grace's rate\n3. $6 x 4 = the number of extra dollars she makes for each hour worked.\n4. Therefore we can arrive to the equation 6 x 4 = 24, which means that Grace gets $24 extra for every hour she is paid for.\n5. This means that if she works for 6 hours she makes $36 extra (6 x 4 = $24 more per hour).\n6. If she works for 10 hours she makes $96 extra (6 x $16 or $4 x 16).\n7. If she works for less, the total extra money she makes for the hour is the number of hours she is paid multiplied by $24. If she works for more, it is multiplied by $4.\n8. As the question is about the total amount of money Grace makes for her hard work it is correct to give the answer as $24 in our calculations of Grace's hourly rate.\nAnswer: $24\n\n### Input 5:You give a 100% reward to a team or student that was able to complete 70% of a project.

He takes a job as a painter and is hired by people to paint pictures. In this sense, he is not an artist.\n2.He makes a living as a painter. This is the most obvious distinction between an artist and a job artist.\n3.A park artist paints pictures in a park. He may not sell them, but he is always painting in the park and not in another location where he is paid for his skill.\n4.Noah is not a park artist as he doesn't only paint in the park. In a sense, he is both an artist and a painter, which doesn't make him any of those things.\n5.Both artist and painter are correct, but they are used in a specific context. An artist is someone who works for a living, and he makes his living from the art that he makes. The painter is the painter of a picture.\n6. So, Noah is an artist, not just a painter.\nAnswer: A painter is not an artist. An artist is someone with a talent; a painter has that talent because the painter can make a living painting pictures.\n\n### Input I am one of these.

It is not something that can regenerate or can be re-attached to the body after losing it.\n3. The question states that an eyebrow is one of these, suggesting that the creature who has an eyebrow cannot possibly have any other feature that the question is asking about.\n4.

He wanted to find what % of his students have\nGrade 5 in general, what number would he need?\n### Demonstatin: It is to be noted that if the initial % is not mentioned in the context, it can be reasonably assumed that the initial is equal to 100.\n### Explanation: What is the initial %? We are given that : 40% of 250 students got grade zero; 250 students are Grade 5 students; Mr. Sanchez found out 40% of these Grade 5 students have a grade zero. This data indicates that there are 100 students in Grade 5 (we don't know how many Grade 4 students might have been in his class). This means that 40 of these students would have a grade zero. Mr. Sanchez finds out that 40 of the 100 students have a zero. What this means is that 40% is equivalent to 40. This means 100% - 40% = 60%, and to be safe, we would find 60%.

She's not collecting money, so that means the total amount of money she collects at any given time will always be $0. The amount of time she spent collecting each \"coin type\" is the total amount of money Joanne collects. 1. \"How much money does she collect per day\" is not a valid question.

At a flea market, the term \"sells handmade crafts\" implies that Hillary makes the items and is the sole seller in the market. It also implies that she sells items, which are crafts.\n2. The condition \"Hillary sells 20 items for 12 cennst\" implies that she has a budget for each item and she is constrained by that budget.\n3. The \"maximum\" she can sell an item indicates that she might not have sold up all the supplies for any item, but there is an upper limit to what she could sell an item for, since she had a budget.\n4. The statement of selling 200 items suggests that she should not overspend the budget and should not sell the items for more than 15 cents but at least 12 cents.\n5. Hence an amount that exceeds her budget while still falling within 12 cents to 15 cents would be a dollar maximum at which she can sell an item.\n6. Choices 4 and 6 are incorrect because, if we are to sell 200 items at 15 cents, we must have bought more than two hundred dollars worth of supplies, which is not the case.\n7.

Choices: \nA: 29 B: 49 C: 69 D: 99 E: 109 \n\n### Demorstration:\nInput : The word rectangle is a shape, prism refers to a 3D shape the shape has to be 3D. In this case, it is. Rectangular shape is 3D. Rectangle shape can't accommodate fish. Rectangular prism refers to a shape where the base is twice the height of the fish tank and the fish in the tank.\nRationales: There are 2 fish tanks. So, we need to find the total weight of 2 fish tanks and find out how many fish are there in the tanks. Hence, the question asks about the dimensions and the number of fish in the tanks. The option A: 29 can be eliminated as it is incorrect. Option B: 49 can be eliminated since the question doesn't talk about the dimensions, it only talks about the fish tank which is bigger than normal fish tanks. Option C: 69 can be eliminated same reasoning as option B is incorrect. Option D: 99 can be eliminated the same reasoning for the option C. So the answer is option E: 108. The other way around is option D: 69.\n\nAnswer: E: 10\n\n### Democratization of Healthcare\n\n### Instructions::  Describe a health care service that you think is undervalued.

In how many days does an average haircut costs around 20% of the total? Choices: 1 Dirty work: $102 2 Incorrect solution. 3 Clean work: $14 4 Correct solution. 5 23 days\nRationales:1.The task asks questions related to Mario's barbership where haircuts are 23% more expensive at a hair salon the other days while on Mondays haircuts seem to cost an additional 102%.\n2.Since haircuts are an average 102% costlier at a hai salon the other day, one can guess that on Monday Mario's salon cost an additional $102.\n3. However, the question does not say that $102 is the additional cost that was incurred by Mario.\n4.Mario's commission is 23% of the total amount so that on a day without discount, Mario would earn around $14.\n5.Since an average haircut would cost $20, and a haircut at any other day would cost $102, an average haircut at Mario's salon would cost around $20+($102-$102)/.23=45$+$15 or around $60.\n6.However, a hair cut costs an additional $23 at a hair salon, not $102.

That means that he scores 12 points in four games (12 points per game). 3: We can calculate this by subtracting the number of yards needed to get 1 TD from the minimum number of TD a player can score in a game and rounding the result to the nearest number. \nThe minimum number of yards needed for 1 TD: The minimum number of yards needed when a player scores a touchdown is 1 yard. 4: \nThe minimum number TD when a player scores a TD: If the player scores 1 touchdown, he needs 4 yards for a total of 5 yards to score 1 TD, while if he scores 2 touchdowns, he needs 5 yards for a total of an 11 (5 yards x 2 TD). \nMinimum number of TD needed for 4 games: The player needs to score 4 touch downs in total, which requires him to get a total of 44 (5 yards when he scores 1 TD + 11 (5 -1) when he scores 2 TDs + 25 (20 -1) when he score 3 TDs + 30 (20 - 1) when he score a full TD + 34 (24 -1) when he scored no TD). \nThis allows us to use the minimum number for 1 TD as a minimum number for 4 games. \nMinimum number needed for 4 games = 44 The minimum number needed for 2 games = 50 The minimum number needed for a half-a-game is 20-1 = 19. \nTherefore, the minimum number of yards required for a full game for 4 TD is 20(4 -1) + 24 =", "answer": " 72"}
{"text": "25 min movie \nInput: What fraction of the previous movie is her movie shorter? Choices: 1. 35%2. 50%3. 20%4. 35%5. 1/3\nRationales: From the information above, we can conclude that Janet's new movie is 60% of the length of her previous movie. When we compare the new movie's length(60%) to her previous movie's length(25 min), we can simply divide the two fractions and obtain a fraction that is 25 min divided by 60%. \nDividing 25/60 = 1/2. \nSo to find the length of Janet's new length in relation to her previous movie, we simply divide 1/2 by 25/6.\nA fraction 1/2 divised by 6/60 = 50%. \n \nHence, the answer is 50%.\n\n### Input:\"Historically, the average rate of US GDP growth was just under 2%.

{"text": "bills and 3 ten-dollar bills in his wallet, and he has 17 coins.How much money does Frank have? Choices: 1) $46 2) $47 3) $56 4) $57 5) $67\n\nRationale:\nThere are many possible scenarios with this. We do not need all coins to be equal value as we can then have $1 coins and therefor only need $11 to make 17, or 7/11 or 14/22 or anything. Then each denomination needs 5/9 or 5/12\nThe problem of course is that you are missing numbers, but they can be solved for to find the answer. The value of each denomination can be found using the equation 11 x n, where n is the amount of that denomination.\nIf Frank had 8 one dollar bills it would be 11 x 8 = 88. Or if he had 6 one dollar bills + 1 three dollar bill + 3 four dollar bills it could also 11 x 6 + 1 x 3 + 3 x 4 = 72\nAnd if he had 17 one dollar bills with 1 one dollar bill left over it would be 17 x 11 + 1 x 11 = 189, or 2 x 189 would be a solution for this question\nThis all goes to show that a lot of the question could be wrong. You only need a subset of each denomination to have 17 each. The one dollar bills, the five dollar bills and the tenners could be anything at all.\n\n### Answer: $47\n\n### Explanation:\nWe know that we have one of each type, there for using the equation with the number of each denomination we know that we will have 4 ten dollar bills which is $40, 4 five dollar bills which 4 x $5 = 20, 3 tenners which 3 x $10 = 30 leaves 7 one dollar bils which is $7, then to that we must add 17 more coins at", "answer": " 3"}

D: the painkillers are now useless given that they didn't work in the first place. E: the painkillers won't work if he swallows them more often than recommended?\nRationales:  1. If the pharmacy ran out of popular medicine and gave him Tylenol instead, it would definitely be unfortunate. \n2. Option A doesn't really make sense. \n3. There is a reason why Tylenol hasn't become so widely used; if it really worked that well, it would have been.\n4. Option C: The effectiveness of the new painkillers is not guaranteed. There is always a chance that they won't work.\n5. Option B: The biochemicals that make up our bodies do many things other than just being medicinal. If the medicines really were to interact properly with the biochemicals in our bodies, then it would mean that they functioned properly.

This is represented by A and C. The pair must be either brother or son/daughter, leaving D and E. Since D is not the oldest child and E is the younger, it must be that D is the son. This leaves only A, B, C, and E as possible pairs of brother and daughter. B and E could be brother and sister, but B is older, implying that it is a brother and daughter pair.\n\nThe last statement also provides that A and C are either brother or sister. There are three pairs of brother and son/daughter in the question, so A and C each can be either brother or sister.\n\nLooking at the final statement, we have B and E, either brother or sister. Since E is younger, it must be a brother. We know that B is at least 3 years older than E, which means that either B or E had a younger sibling who is younger than the baby.

One useful way to do this is to provide a list of the advantages and disadvantages of each answer, as well as a justification for the choice of one over the other.\n4. For example, if the question is about calculating an answer, they might explain that they took option \"A\" first, but realized their mistake and switched to option \"B\", which was more accurate.\n5. Alternatively, the student might explain that they chose option \"B\" because although it was more complex than option \"A\", it also had more advantages for completing the question correctly.\nAnswer: Considering the question as \"Explain the reasoning behind and preferring one answer over another\",", "answer": " 57"}

We can use division to determine the number of absences in the given time period. \n2. From the sentence, we can infer that the time period over which the absences are being counted is one year. \n3. Therefore, the operation to arrive at the answer would be division. \n3. The denominator or divisor, in this case, would be the number of days in a year, or 365 days. \n4. We can use the given information to determine the numerator or number to be divided, that is the number of days absences in a time period, this would be '8 small diaries'. \n5. Hence, the correct operation to solve the problem would be the division that would require us to divide the number of days '8 small diaries' by the number of days in the time period, or '365'.\n6.

A meter is a unit of measure, so 10 meters would take 10 seconds. The only thing that would alter that is gravity. You would need to consider the rate at which you are falling to figure out how long it would take to get to school. 2. To find this, you would use the equation s=1/2 g t^2.

Choices: 1. 51 2. 72 3. 67 4. 69 5. 65\nRationales: From this question, the only relevant information we have is that Jeremy went from 44 songs to 72 with each passing day by adding at least two songs to his playlist from the day before. \n6. We also know he didn\u2019t repeat a song from any given day.\n7. With that information, it\u2019s not possible to work out exactly how many songs he listened to in total. However, the options do not exhaust all the possibilities, so we might be able to calculate an approximate answer.\n8. Firstly, 65 sounds like a good estimate for the total number of songs he listened to in all and it\u2019s not possible in the limited questions that are asked to come up with more than that.  \n\nSecondly, from the options, it can be ruled out that Jeremy listened to exactly 51, 66, 67, 69, 72 as there\u2019s not enough information to confirm a number that exactly.  \n\nFinally, we know it\u2019s impossible for option 4 to be correct since Jeremy has exactly two Wednesdays in the process so if he listened to 6 fewer Thursday songs on Thursday, he couldn\u2019t have listened to more than 2 as well on Wednesday.

For example, a square can be much longer compared to its width which would be the case when we create a square inside a long or narrow space.\n\nAlso, it is worth noting that grid is an even space with equal amounts on each side.\n\nBecause of the constraints of the grid and the description, we can conclude that each square will be a square that is the size of the grid's dimensions, so each square will be 10x15.\n\nIn the answers, the only options that make sense per the description are:    \n\n- (A) 15x15\n- (C) 30x30\n- (D) 45x45\n\nHowever, based on the grid of squares we know that the height of the space needs to be described in terms of increments of 10 which in this case means that the height cannot be 15 as described.\n\nTherefore, only the options (A) and (C) make sense to us.\n\nAnswer: A: 10x10    B: 30x31\n\nInput: How to fill in the 1st three boxes on an xy coordinate plane  Choices:  A) x = 3, y = 1  B) x = 4, y = 2  C) x = 1, y = 4  D) x = 6, y = 9  E) x =", "answer": " 66"}

The amount of time to grill is 15 time longer than the amount of time to clean the grill after each session. The time it takes to prepare for the next grill session is always 0 time. Answer:B: 15 time the time needed to grill. \nThe number of the total hamburgers that are able to be grilled per session without interruption are directly proportionate to the time it takes to grill each hamburger. \nThe number directly proportional to the time taken is 15. So the total of 15 total hamburgers in a session can be grilled without interruption if the grilling time is halved. \nAnswer Choice A:15/the amount of time it takes to get ready for the next session is the same as grilling 15 hamburger patties per session without interruption. Let's say Ronald takes 1 min to grill a hamburger. 1 min = 15 hamburger per session. That means Ronald cannot grill 15. Also, the question says he grills 15 hambuggers per session in 15 min or less.

The question asks us to categorize the family based on its members and their relationships with each other.\n2. As a family, a group of people who are related by blood, marriage, or adoption form a family. This can include a mother, father, children, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, and cousins.\n3. A nuclear family is a family consisting of two parents and their biological children, but in our case, Javier has a wife, not a nuclear family.\n4. A blended family is a family that contains two or more households (or families) with at least one child in common and with parents who are remarried.\n5. A matrilineal family is a family in which the mother is the head of the household and all descendants follow her lineage.\n6. Patrilineal family is the complete opposite of a matrilineal family. In patrilineal families, the father is the head of the clan, and matrimonial ties strengthen the clan.\n7. Javier has two dogs, but no one is following a dog dynasty.\n8. Therefore by this point, the answer should be quite obvious. We know that Javier has 3 children (including himself).\n9. So this family has six members, including the Javier's wife.\n10.

{"text": "apple had 6 oranges. He sold each orange for $2 and made $9 from each orange sold. This means he earned $54. What did he spend to buy the pineapples? Choices: \nA: $15 B: $12 C: $33 D: $24 E: $6\nRationales:1. The question is looking for the amount that Jonah spent on the pineapples. \n2. In order to find the answer, it is first necessary to determine how much was spent on each pineapple. \n3. From the statement, we know that Jonah spent $3 to buy each pineapple and each pineapple had 3 oranges. This means that each pineapple cost $3 to buy, but it held 3 oranges that were sold for $2 each. \n4. Therefore, the cost to buy each pine apple is $3, and the income from each orange sold is $2. \n5. The total income from those oranges is $9, so multiply that times the number of oranges each pineapple sold, which is 3. This gives you $9 x 3 = $27. \n6. Since each pineapple sold 3 oranges, that means Jonah earned $27 from each pineapple. Subtract $27 from $3 to find the cost of the pineapple. 7. $27 - $3 = $24. That means Jonah spent $24 to buy 6 pineappies. 8. The answer is C: $33.\nAnswer: C:$33\n\n### Input : What number has 3 even digits?

{"text": "every tree they cut down they will also plant 3 trees back. What percentage of trees would they replant? Choices: A: 10% B: 20% C: 30% D: 40% E: 50% Answer: C: 30%. Explanation: The company will plant 3 for every tree they cut, so it would replant (cut-plant-cut) = cut-plant = replantation. Cutting would be cutting the first tree for whatever reason. Replanting would have 3 plants for each reason the tree was cut down. This means that each tree cut would cause (3+1) plants to grow, so dividing 3 by 2, we get 3/2 = 1.5 which is a bit more than 50% because of that little fraction. Cut-plant = planting 1:1.5 of trees = 3:6 which is 2/3 of trees.\nWe are already close to 30%, so we keep dividing by 3 to convert it to a percent. 3/6 times 3 == 2/3% + 0.5/3% which is 12/15 of the total number of times you cut down the tree, times 100% ( 12*15/100) -> 12 times out of 15 you replanted. So that means that the total number of trees would have to be replanted 12/125 or 12/25 -> 48 times over 25 years. However the company does these 3 times, so if we keep dividing the entire number by 3 to make it a percent, then we get ((12/25)*3 ))/25 which gets us 30% to 3 decimal places, which is C.\n\n### Input:\"What is the resultant acceleration of body a and 3 times body a?\" Choices:[A] + [A]\nRationales: What does \"A\" mean? \"3 times body a\" means 3 more or three times what [A] means\n\n\nInput: Which of these is a rational polynomial?

D) The information given is insufficient to say who has more shoes. E) Who has more books? Rationales: 1) The questions gives us half of a ratio Jacob and Edward have. We have two pieces of information: the difference between Edward's number of shoes and Jacob's number books, and the relationship is Jacob has half the number of books that Edward does. Since we are given half, we can determine that Edward has twice the number of books as jacob does. Therefore, Jacob has fewer shoes than Edward. Option A: is incorrect because Jacob has \"half the number of shoes\" and therefore, Jacob has fewer shoeses. That is an A for Jacob. 2) We are given half the ratio: Edward and Jacob. Therefore, we can say that Edward has twice the books as Jacob. Option B: is incorrect because we have the knowledge that Edward has twice the amount. Jacob has half the amount. Jacob has fewer shoes and Edward has twice. Therefore Edward has more shoes. That is a B for Jacob. 3) That is an E for Edwad in book category. 4) This question is asking for the correct answer to whether or not Edward has more shoes or Jacob has more shoes. What information we do have says that Jacob has fewer shoes. Option C: is incorrect because while the ratio states that Jacob has half the shoes in comparison to Edward\u2019s, that still makes Jacob have \"fewer shoes\" than Edward. Jacob still has fewer in number. 5) Answer is D: As previously mentioned they have both had half the number of shoeses. However, Edward has twice the number books and Jacob has all.

Choices: A: Use a relative that she knows what year they were born B: Use math to estimate the year C: Use a calendar D: Create a list of names and put them in order E: Get information from her father\nRationales:\n1. The task at hand revolves around knowing the date of birth of Connie's grandmother, implying that she is looking for information and assistance with recalling the date of her grandmother's birth.\n2. Option A: Using a relative that she knows when they were born is a correct response but is more likely to lead to an incorrect answer unless she is able to accurately recall when her relative was born from memory alone.\n3. Option B: Using math to estimate the year her grandmother was likely to be born is an incorrect response because estimating the date requires more information than is provided.\n4. Option C: Using a calendar is not a viable method of obtaining the information as a calendar displays only the date of the current year, not the year of birth for an ancestor.\n5. Option E: Getting assistance from her father is an incorrect response, as she may not have access to or be comfortable with revealing the information to him.\n6. Option D: Creating a list of names and putting them in order is the most applicable response to the task because it requires the application of a set of instructions to obtain the desired information.\n7.

{"text": "$80, what does a chair cost? Choices:A: $7 B: $8 C: $73 D: $4 E: $16\n### Rationales:\n1. The question is a ratio problem, so it's important to understand the context of the question and how the answer choices are related.\n2. Based on the context, we can see that the cost of a chair is 1/7 of (some value) or 14.28571428% of the cost of a given table, with the table costing $80.\n3. With an unknown 'x' in the equation, we can see from a logical perspective that it is clear that 'x' must be < 7 because 'x' represents a percentage of something and %<100.\n4. Looking at the given answer choices, option E: $16 satisfies the logical requirement, it satisfies the %<100 rule.\n5. The only possible other solution is option A: $14.29. This is a value less than $20 but greater than $14.28.\n6.

Options: A: Seven B: Six C: Five D: Four E: Two Choices: \n### Demonstation:\nInput:Mary and Rose \n### Demostrition:\nInput:M: The term \"present\" in the context of the shopping experience refers specifically to an item purchased that is given as a gift to someone else. For example, when we buy Christmas presents for each other, we're buying presents. It is likely not intended in a general sense to have a broader sense such as \"something that you purchase.\" So we can eliminate A, B, D, E.\n\n### Input:- \n### Demstnation:- \nInput: C: A common mistake that people make is thinking that present is a noun in our context, and that we can compare their amounts to see who received more. However, present is not a noun but rather a verb. So, the question asks how many present do Rose received. This implies Rose as the subject of the sentence.

D: makes an idea _________ from all the others E: makes the greatest _________ of all ideas. 4. The correct answer is _________. Choices: 1: A: focus 2: B: strength 3: C: better choice 4: D: impact\nRationales: The first sentence states that \"the most impactful idea is the one that stands out from all the others\". \n2 and 3 do not describe the phrase \"stand out from all the others\", so both can be eliminated. \n4 seems redundant and therefore can be eliminated.  \nBy process of elimination, the only remaining answer is B: focus.  \nExplanation: The focus of an idea is its most important or central point. It is the focus of our attention. So to stand out from all the others means that the idea has become the focal point that we are considering and this, in turn, means that the idea has the most _________ of all others.\n\n### Input\nQuinton brought 46 cupcakes to school for his birthday and gave 15 of them to his classmates: Which of the following fractions is closest to the fraction of cupcakes Quinton kept?

There are 5 elementary classes, each having 20 students.\nEach classroom will have 20 students that won't eat meat\nIt is specified that the fruit is not allowed, so each classroom will have 80 students that will not eat fruit.\nSo, there will be 5 classrooms that will not eat meat nor fruit.\n2. We assume there are 4 classrooms that will eat meat.\n3. From this, there will be 15 students in each of the 5 classrooms that do not eat meat and fruit for a total of 75 students.\n4. There are 5 classrooms that eat meat and fruit for the remaining 593 students.\n5. Add the classrooms that do not have meat or fruit and the classrooms that do have meat and fruit, there will be 698 students.\n6. Subtraction 698 - 75 = 623 students.\n\n7. Adding both the classrooms without the mentioned types of food, the answer is 621.\n8. Adding the students that do not eat meat nor fruit, we find that students there will be 598 students.\n9.

The statement provides hints about the meaning of breadcrumbs and what they are used for.\n2. Breadcrumbs are small pieces of bread that are often used as an ingredient in recipes, as in meatloaf.\n3. We cannot assume that melanie is making breadcrumbs from leftover bread and trying to figure out their use as an ingredient.\n4. From the context, which suggests that the breadcrumb ingredient is used to bind meat together in a meatloaf or meatball recipe, it appears that melanie is looking for more information about breadcrumbs, not making them.\n5. Option A, a breadcrumb inquirie, makes the incorrect assumption that she is making breadcrumb from leftover, or scraps of bread. \n6. Option B, a lof of a question, seems to indicate that she wants to make a loaf of breadcrumb or croutons, which is not what she is actually looking for.\n7. Option D, an inquiring inquiry breadcrumb, is a double negative that is very difficult to read, making it harder to figure out the intended meaning.\n8.

A vampire's need for 7 gallons of sucked blood per week would imply that 32 would be the correct answer as the word 'gallon' can be roughly converted to '32 ounces'. If the size 'gallons' had been 32 ounces, it would read '7 gallons, which can be further read as 7X32= 216 ounces (the sum of which is equivalent to 24 ounces since 7=7X1). However, since it is read as 7 gallons per week, implying 32 ouncers per one gallon or 7 gallons, we cannot determine which number to choose from the options (options 1 and 5). The options cannot be narrowed down to 3, 13, or 48 since the problem does not explain the presence of a vampire's canines as an implication of vampire teeth. However, the number 28 is the only possibility that fits the problem statement. In addition, it must be noted that the units of ounces and gallons does not directly and clearly suggest 'ounces' as the answer; hence, the option (5) cannot be chosen.\n2. There is no definite number of teeth a vampire has without an explanation about their canines. Only if we were given more information explaining the relation between the canines of a vampire and their total number of teeth would it be valid to choose the option (5). However, as the question is in simple terms, it implies that the vampires have 28 teeth, since we do not know the significance of the canine teeth.\n\n### Input : If you have a pizza, which one would you order?

The statement does not say why they can't sell the cows in market.\n2. They don't have any information about cows sold to market to compare price. Hence there cannot be a possibility of a price comparison.\n3. From the given reasoning there is also no mention of distance to the market. \n4.

The question focuses on the percentage of Italian people on William's \n2.  We need to know the total number of people to determine the percentage of those people that are Italian.\n3.  The question is worded specifically to ask about the percentage of Italian people.\n4.  It is more likely that we need to find the total number of Italian people on the bus in order to find the percentage of Italian people among those.\n5.  To determine the percentage, we need to plug the amount of Italian people, 3/5, into the fraction (x /100)\n6.  Therefore, the fraction would be 25/100, or (25 * 100) /100. (25 x 100) is the amount of Italian people (3/5 or 0.6) and 100 is the total.\n7.  Thus, the percentage of Italians on the bus is 2/5, which can also be shown as 40%. \nAnswer: 40%\n\n### Input:\"John\" in the sentence is a noun, not a pronoun. What part of speech is the word \"in\"?\n\n### Demotion:\nInput: In the sentence, \"John went swimming after work\", \"John\" functions as the subject of the sentence and therefor holds the predicate noun.\nRationales\n1. As the subject, John holds the predicate as an object, hence John is a noun.\n2. The phrase, \"after work\" in the sentence serves as a conjunction to indicate time.\n3. The noun John functions as the subject in the sentence, so \"in\" is a modifying phrase which modifies the subject.\n4. Hence, the sentence can be restructured as, \"the swimming after work John\" which denotes 'John in swimming after work'.\n5.

The problem asks the number to be divided by how many, and how much to get left over. In the case of the question, we take 200 divided by six which gives 33.3 for the result. We then subtract that number from the total number, 200. This gives us a new number, 32.7, which we can rephrase like this: \"out of every 32 rows, 32.8 of them would be filled.\"\n\n### Demo (Wrong):\nC: We can do an inverse of 6 divided by 200\n\ninverse of 6 divided by inverted 6 divided by 6\n\n### Demo(Wrong):\nD: 6 divided by 333333\n\n## A: 200 divided 4=50\n\n200divide by 3= 67\n\n### Demo & Rationals:\n\n\nUsing long division, divide the number of rows (200) by the number of chains (4), getting 50. Since we have already accounted for the rows that are not filled out, we can use the following equation: 50 = 13 rows per every one", "answer": " 600"}

Choices: A: four B: three C: six D: seven E: nine\nRationales:1. The Club president is asking club members to bring one egg to an event called an Omelet Breakfast. The egg is part of an omelet, which is the goal of the fundraiser. The club can\u2019t serve omelets if they don\u2019t have eggs.\n2. The total number of eggs the club has is not important to the problem. The total number of omelets is important.\n3. The club will need one egg for each member to get a whole omelet, plus there will need to be extras. This can be calculated as follows:\n1 egg + (1 member x 1 egg) = 1 omelet\nN members x 1 egg = N omelets\n4 extra members, so N + 4 = 21\n4.

The question asks for the total amount of points that would be awarded if someone wins a card game. \n2. This question can be answered by the use of mathematical processes such as addition and subtraction.\n3. To determine the total amount of points awarded to a card game winner, you would start with adding the number of points awarded for every round that is won. \n4. In this case, there is a total of 10 points awarded for a single round, so the amount of points awarded will be 10 for every round won.  5. However, there is a limitation with this method as the total amount of points could become unreasonable or even infinite if someone keeps winning every single round as there would be no 0 awarded. \n6. To address this, we can remove the infinite possibility of earning a high number of points.\n7. After you have added all the amounts of points that someone can potentially receive, you will subtract 10.\n8. As the game ends with a total of 1 point \n9. The total amount of points awarded would be 10 + 3\n\nRationales\n1. The question is about the points that are awarded for each card game round with a value of 10 points.

How long does he work each day?\nInput: The task is to calculate the amount of time that Ben is working per day, given the information provided in the question.\n\n## Option 1:\n\nWe can determine the amount of time worked by Ben by using the following formula:\n\nWorked time = Working time - total travel time\n\nIn our case, the working time is 8 hours, and the total travel time is 50 minutes + 40 minutes = 90 minutes.\n\nThus, we can conclude that Ben works for 8 hours - 90 minutes = 7 hours and 10 minutes per day.\n\n## Option2:\n\nAccording to the information given in the question, it is evident that Ben works for 50 minutes + total travel time =50 minutes + 90 minutes =140 minutes per day. As the working time is 140 minutes, and Ben is working for the same amount of time, he works for 140 minutes per work day.\n\n### Option E:\n\nBen works for 40 minutes, which is the total travel time + total working time. Hence, Ben works for a total of 40 minutes per day in the given situation.\n\n## Rationale:\n\nAn option needs to be dismissed if it doesn\u2019t meet the criteria, and there is no point in considering something as a valid option in terms of dismissal when the following considerations are satisfied:\n  * It doesn\u2019t follow the instructions.\n  * It makes little to no sense.\n  * It is the most outrageous.\n  * There is a logical way to eliminate it, like the task.\n  * It doesn't match the example.", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "thirds of the basketball players are women. How many students are on the girls basketball team?\nRationales:  1. The first part of the problem (in bold) is describing the number of people playing basketball. To solve this part, we simply need to divide the number of people by two to get the total people playing basketball.\n2. Next, the two-thirds description means that the number of female basketball players is 6/2 = 3/2 of the players.\n3. Next, the sentence \u201cHow many students are on the boys basketball team\u201d is a rephrased version of the next part of the question. This clarifies that the students on the girls basketball team are in the same class as the girls on the basketball team (not different classes). \n4. With all this reasoning in mind, it is safe to conclude that the students on the girl\u2019s basketball team are simply the total number of students playing girls basketball minus the students who play boys basketball.\n5. It is important to realize that the answer could be 7 (give or take), since we were only asked to round to the nearest whole number.\n6.

{"text": "his percentage also increases. Where does the game of basketball rank him? Choices: 60% 50% 40% 30% 20%\nRationales:\n1. The question is about the percentage of free throws in basketball game, and the increase of percentage depends on the number of fouls got. We can eliminate the options that are less than 50%. As for the other options, there are some numbers that could not be reached in that situation. However, John also has a 70% of free throws, so the best answer, if the answer is in a percentage, must be greater than 60% and less than or equal to 100%.\n2. We can know that John has a percentage of 70%, and if we assume that John got a foul, what will be the percentage of free throws? In fact, there are several scenarios, and we can choose the best answer.\n3. The answer can increase to 70%+70%*k (k>=0) or even decrease to 70%* (k>=1). \n4. According to this idea, the answer will be as much as the number of fouls John got increased (it may be 70%*1 or 70%*2, or even 70%*k), or a fraction of percentage he would gain per each foul he would get (it may be 0, 70%*0.5 or 70%*(k/100)).\n5. We can eliminate some options like a number that is not a common integer.\n6. According to the final result, we can think that John would have a percentage of 80%. Since, it can be a fraction (70%*(k / 100)) in which (k >=1).\n7. The best answer would be 80%.\nAnswer: 80%", "answer": " 112"}

The question states you pluck and put one flower under your pillow each night.\nThis is not a time problem the time problems all give an indication of time, there is no time given here.\nA. 6, this would indicate that you can only see six flowers after accounting for each night you pluck one.\nThis means you can only see five when accounting for each night.\nB. 7, The question states that the last one is put back on the 6th night so this option is not correct.\nC. 8, same reason as (A).\nD. 16, The question states that \u201cexcept for the one that you put under your pillow each the night...\u201d This means the days it took you to pluck one.

And what do we call February 29th? A. leap day B. additional day C. second day D. day before Sunday E. one day from March 1st\n\nRationales: D. day before Sunday is incorrect because: day before Sunday could either \nbe day before Monday (28 days) or Day Before Tuesday ( 27 days), is incorrect.\n\nC.

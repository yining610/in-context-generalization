{"text": "1: The answer to this question will involve simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, in that order. \n2.  Subtract: We know that the initial weight of the box (prior to filling with jelly beans, brownies, and gummy worms) is 0 pounds. \n3.  Multiplication: The total weight needs to be 9 pounds, so we can find that amount that we have left, from subtracting our total weight. \n4.  Addition: What do we need to add to get to 9 pounds?\n5.  Subtraction: We know that the final weight of the care package is 9 pounds.  Therefore, we can subtract that from our total to find out how much to add. \n6.  Multiplication once again: Now that we know what to add, we can multiply the amount by the weight of one jelly bean. \n7.  Addition again: We can now add in the amount we found from multiplication.\n8.  Finally, we can divide the total weight of everything added by 5, the number of pounds in a pound, to finish this question.\nSo the final equation after the calculations is below\n\n(9 - 0) = 9 + (2 - 0) = (9 - 2) +(3 - 0) =(9 - 2) * (1/3) + (3 - 2) *(1/2) + (2/5) = 12\n\nSo the final answer to this equation is 12.5.", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "In order to address this question, it is first necessary to restate the statement in simpler terms that are easier to process.\n1. The question asks about the number of buildings that collapsed after an earthquake.\n2. The given statement is in the form of a prediction by the experts.\n3. The prediction by the experts is based on a pattern: that each earthquake would have half the number of buildings collapse as the previous one due to instability in foundations.\n4. The pattern is in the form of an equation as follows:\nX = (Number of collapsing buildings from X earthquake) <= (1/2) * (Number of collapses from (X - 1) earthquake)\n5. Rewriting the prediction as an algebraic equation gives us:\nX = (2x - 1) <= (1/4) * (x - 1) [where x is the earthquake index]\n(using the fact that X-X = 0)\n6. Solving this equation gives us:\n(x - 1) = (1/n) where n = 3 for this problem\n7. Therefore, according to the experts' prediction, after the third earthquake, the total number of collapsed buildings would be equal to 1/3th of the number of buildings that started to collapse. In this case, it would be (4)/3 which is 1.33.\n8.

Given: The rectangle for the living room is is 4 feet by 6 feet in area. The bedroom is 2 feet by 4 feet in area.\n3. We can see that the living room rectangle has 4 times the area of the bedroom rectangle so we will multiply the bedroom area by 4 to figure out how much to cut from the bolt of fabric for the living room.\n4. Area of the bedroom= (2 feet by 4 foot rectangle)= (2 ft) x (4 ft)= 8 square feet\n5. Area of the Living Room=(4 ft by 6 foot)= (4 ft) x (6 ft)=24 square feet\n6. Now we multiply the area of the living room by 4 to figure how much fabric to cut for the living room. 24 square feet when multiplied by 4 will produce a 24 X 4 square feet rectangle, we will cut 24 X 6 square feet in all.

{"text": "1. The first step in solving this problem is to set up the equation that will yield the correct answer. This involves finding the new weight of the cow, which we do in the following manner.\n2. We know that the cow originally weighed 400 pounds (pounds is short for pound weight).\n3. The cow has gained another 400 pounds, which means that the new weight is equal to the old weight plus 400 pounds = new weight = 400 + 400 = 800 pounds.\n4. The cow is then priced at $3 per pound, as specified by the question.\n5. When multiplied, $3 per pound comes out to $3 multiplied by 1.5 = $4.50\n6. Therefore, the cow is now worth $4.50. \n7. The value of the cow increased after gaining weight.\nSo the final value of the cow at the end is $4.50.", "answer": " 600"}

The first two equations, 4x+4, and 3x+7, can be combined into the single equation 4(x+3)=3(x+7)\n6. Similarly, the two remaining equations, 2x-11 and x -12, can be combined into 2(x-9)=1(x-12).\n7. Both of the combined equations can be simplified so that x+9= 4(x-12) and x=6y\n8. And finally. x=6y, which simplifies to y= 10.\n9. So, the number of stickers remaining is y=10.\nSo the final solution is x=10\n\nInput: What does a rocket need? Choices: A: water B: space C: atmosphere D: fuel E: gravity", "answer": " 42"}

The wording of the question makes it clear that the two options offered are not actually the same as a footwear. Both the choices are used to refer to a type of footwear, so we can eliminate choice C. \n2. 'Clown' is someone who wears a costume to entertain people or make them laugh, hence, it is worn outside the house.

Similarly, option B is not correct because wool is not really a type of fabric. Like furs, it can be used to make fabrics of various types but does not qualify as a type of fabric.\n4. Cotton is generally considered warm, but not in the case of heavyweight and combed varieties, hence excluding it from our choices. \n5. So the options left are linen and nylon.\n6.

{"text": "1. First, we must understand the question correctly. We can infer from the question that a year ago means costs were less than they are now, so, option X cannot be applied.\n2. Second, we must understand the word '2/5 times,' which is an instruction on how to approach the problem. This usually means that the cost of something is doubled, hence two times. But, the original cost is reduced by 5 times, which is half. Hence, one fifth is then equal to half of double of, which is 2/5. \n3. Now, from the question statement, we know that we need to multiply the cost by two, or 200%, and multiply it by 5, or half. \n4. To understand what this means, the original cost a year ago was $180, so it means the original cost should be double for now.\n 5. It is then multiplied by half which is half of $1800 which is $900. So, we are multiplying 200% by one quarter. \n6. So, the total cost of Mr. Lucian's lawnmowers, now, is now $1800 * 200% * X% * 900 = $27,200. \n7. This information is needed to calculate how much it is costing Mr. Lucian to purchase four such mowers. To do this, we need to divide $27,240 by 4 = $6,810.\n8.

The word 'averaged' indicates that something was computed through the addition of a series of numbers, and then divided by the number of numbers in the series. There are two pieces of information given '40 apples' and '28 apples' which are then combined to find the average.\n2.) Given these pieces of information we can then determine that the number Layla picked is one less than the average of 30 apples.\n3.) Using the 30 apples as an average of the entire group of 30 appled picked in total, it can be simplified that the average value is 30.\n4.) From this, if we subtract the total number of 30 from the total group of 40 we get: (40 - 30) = 10, meaning 30 is taken away from total apples Layla picked.\n5.) Finally, to confirm the result in 4 we can substitute the number '10' for the variable 'x'.\n6.) From this, we have the final result that 'Layla picked apples'.\n7.)

{"text": "1) The answer to this question lies in understanding the context of the problem.\n2) First, let's set up the given information in terms of distance:\n- 2 miles per hour in swimming = 2 miles per hour run\n- 2 hours of swimming = 1 hour and 30 minutes of running\n3) One must also be careful of the units of the given information. \ni) Swimming = miles per hour\nii) Running = number of miles\niii) The given units can combine in the following way to solve the problem. We could write\n- 1 mile = 5,280 feet and distance = run in miles + swim in miles, where\n- swim = 2*5,280 and run = 4*5,288\n4) So we have the following equation:\n- distance =  run*4 + swim\n5) Once we substitute the appropriate values for x and y, we get the following\ndistance = (1.5*4) + 2*5280 = 12.144 miles.\nSo the final  answer is \"Tom swims for 12.\nSo the final ans is D: 82.4 miles\"", "answer": " 12"}

Her total points would always be a multiple of 10.\n6) Therefore, Jane played a total of at least 9 rounds, winning 8 and losing 1, and gained a total of 40 points.\n7) To figure out how many rounds she played, multiply her 60 points by the 4/5 of 9, which equals 8.33 rounds.\n8) Therefore, Jane played at least 8.33 and at most 9 rounds.\nSo the final number of rounds she played equates to 9 rounds.", "answer": " 8"}

Solving the equation for x yields x = 2 x = 2\n4. Now, using the equation Lavinia's daughter is 1x older and Katie's daughter is also 2x younger.\n5. The question then becomes about the difference between Lavinia's and Katie's daughters' ages.\n6. By rearranging the equation as Lavinia = 1 x x + 2, the unknown value of x can be found by dividing by two and subtracting five.\n7.

{"text": "1. The first step is to determine whether Anna and Josh were born on the same date and the same year or not. \n2. By adding up the number of days between August 17th in each year, it can be seen that they are different years. So option C is incorrect.\n3. The combined age of Josh and Anna is 30+30, which is 3x2x1. Therefore, option C is incorrect as the combined age is not five times the age of Josh. \n4. Anna\u2019s age is not given clearly, but we know that her age must be five times Josh\u2019s age. Since Anna's age is not mentioned, we must subtract Josh's age by five. \n5. Since Josh\u2019s age is 3 times the age of Anna, her age now becomes 5x2x3. If her age is 50x3 now, then subtracting 50 from both sides of equation would mean subtracting 50x3 from Anna\u2019s age now. \n6. Anna's age is now 150x2 = 300.

{"text": "The given question can be thought of in terms of calculating the remaining budget, so to help determine the coursework materials expenditure, we can take the amount spent on food, accommodation and entertainment and subtract that from the total $1000. This gives us $300.\n1. Multiplying the amount spent on coursework materials by the value of 1.0 - (30/100), when $300 is the remainder, will give the amount of his expenditure for coursework materials. This is because the money spent on coursework materials is calculated by subtracting the money spent on food, accommodations and entertainment.\n2. Let's have a look at what multiplication means. Multiplication is about multiplying two numbers. $300 is 1.0 - the remainder from the equation $1000 - (300/100). If the remainder wasn't $300, then the answer wouldn't be $300. In the case of 1.0 multiplied by $300, we get $300 multiplied by 1.0, which is the same thing.\n3. What is 1.0? 1.0 is the same as 1.0 divided by 1.0.\n4. If we go back to the calculation $1000 minus (300/200 minus (35/20), we can see that 35/20 is multiplied by 10. This is because 10 is the common denominator in the fraction 35/25, which we get after doing the division operation.\n5. So, multiplying 1.0 by $300 is equivalent to multiplying (300/30) by 10.\n6. The given expression is $1000 $1000 which means that both the numerator and the denominator are divided by $1000, giving the answer $300. So, the final answer is A. $300.", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "First, we need to identify the quantities and relationships required to formulate a mathematical\nstatement that represents the situation.\n1. The class has 30 students.\n2. Each hotel room has two queen-sized beds and one pull-out couch.\n3. The principal needs to book enough hotel rooms to fit all of the class' students into those rooms.\n4. Therefore, the total number of hotel rooms will equal the total number of class students plus one excess room (the room with the couch) to account for any students who may not be able to fit into the rooms.\n5. To calculate, we can first add the total number of students (30) and the number of excess rooms (1). \n6. Then, since each hotel room can fit six people, we need to add a sum of six times those two values together.\n7. Therefore, our solution is: 30 + 1 = 31.\n8. Therefore 31x6 = 186 rooms.\nSo the final math question answer is 186\n\nInput: If it's a 10th of an inch on a ruler, what's it's fraction on a ruler? Choices: 1. Twelfth 2. Half 3. Twelfth 4.

{"text": "The question can be understood as follows: The normal magazine subscription, which lasts an entire year, is normally priced at $34. If we apply the discount of 25 cents per issue for each of the next 9 months, then how much should we pay for the magazine subscription that lasts 18 months? \n1. To answer this question, we first need to look at the math behind the promotion. At 25 cents off per issue, the magazine subscription for $34 would normally cost $34 - $0.75 for all 12 issues. But if we take this same subscription and spread it out for 18 months, rather than 12 months, the subscription price would be 12/18ths of the original subscription price multiplied by the discount rate (25 cents off each twice-a month issue). \n2. We can calculate this as $34 = $0.34 (12/18) x 0.25, which simplifies to $0.34 x 0.2041. In other words, the 25-cent discount for 18 months of the magazine subscription works out to $0.78. If we deduct this amount from $34, the full price for the 18 month magazine subscription would be $34 - $78 = -44.\n3. Therefore, the answer to the question is that the promotional magazine subscription is $44 cheaper than the normal one.\nSo the final  answer is C: $44 cheaper.\n\nInput: You find two pairs of shoes that  cost about the same.

We need to know the present age of Patrick who is half the age of Robert and the present age of Robert to determine the age of Patrick.\n2. The present age of Patrick is given as half (50%) of the present age of Robert which gives Patrick's current age as 50% of twice (x2) of Robert's current age (i.e. x2(Robert)) which is Robert's current age plus \u00bd * x2 (Robert) which can be simplified to Robert's current age - \u00bd (1/2 Robert's current age) = \u00bd * Robert's current age.\n3. In order to find Robert's current age, we need to determine how old that future years are from the future date of Robert's birth.\n4. The current age of Patrick is equal to \u00bd * Robert' patners current age which is 2 years. So we can subtract 2 years from Robert' patners current years to determine Robert' current age.\n5. Hence, Robert' patners current year age (i.e Robert's current age years) = 2 (Robert' patners current age + 2) = 2 years - (Robert' patner's current age).\n6. 2 years - (50% of Robert' patner's age) = 50% of Robert 2 years - (2 years) = 50%.\n7. 2 years - 2 years = 0 years which means Robert' patners current yaar is 2 years.\n8.

There are three other tasks to be done, but they are incomplete and so, cannot be measured or calculated.\n3. The bathroom needs cleaning for a total of fifteen minutes (which is already stated), but how much in minutes does it need to be cleaned?\n4. This makes the third task ambiguous and incomplete. This is where deduction comes in: the person has been mentioned to spend time cleaning the bathroom and then later on to spend time cleaning her room (as well as her laundry and homework). So, bathroom and room cleaning need to happen after each other. \n5. This also suggests that homework cleaning happened first.\n6. The rest is deducted through comparison with other activities: bathroom cleaning took fifteen minutes, and room cleaning took some fraction of hour. \n7. Now, we can deduce homework cleaning also takes some fraction of an hour. This deduction is made on the basis that the homework tasks took a total of one hour to complete, yet there were three other tasks left unfinished. \n8. Now, we understand that homework took one hour but that all other tasks only took a fraction of an hour. \n9. This makes the answer B. With everything else having been left unfinished at the end of the hour, she spent the rest of her time on room cleaning.\nSo the final is B.

The question itself does not tell us too much.\n2. So, we need to identify what is being asked.\n3. One way is to look at the questions that the question is asking.\n4. The question is not asking for the next two prime numbers.\n5. It is simply asking whether the result of multiplying two consecutive prime numbers is prime or not.\n6. If we take the equation (1) p x p, where p and p-1 are two consecutive primes, we can see that the answer is a prime number of p and p-1 as p(p-1) is a factor of the whole expression (1.)\n7.

{"text": "1 We are asked to calculate the total amount of marbles, based on the information given.\n2. We need to identify the units being used, and the relationships between them. \n3. Note that each jar has an integer amount of marbles, so  a given amount of marbles is being described using integers (e.g. \"marbles\").\n4. Additionally, each amount of marbles is separated by a \"than.\"\n5. The units of measure in between \"marbles\" are \"less\" and \"twice.\" \n6. We also know that each jar has a certain amount of marbles. Jar A has the least amount of marbles.\n7. Using this information, we can begin to answer our original question of how many marbles there are in total.\n8. Based on the units and relationships given, we can conclude that marbles added are being quantified using the \"less\" comparator, and that marbles removed are being quantified using \"more.\"\n9. This means that the relationship that indicates how many more marbles there are can be derived by using the difference calculator formula \"x + 12 = 28.\"\n10. Substituting the known numbers \"x\" and \"12\" into this formula yields \"x + 1 = 28.\" \n11. This then implies that the question is asking for a quantity which is 1 less than 28.\n12. We can confirm this by looking at the marbles' order: Jar A (with the least amount), Jar B (with the amount added by Jar A), and Jar C (with the amount doubled by Jar B).\n13.

For Elyce's brother, he can carry 3(4) = 12 bags, so 12 * 30 =240. So one trip he will need to carry one or more bags grocerie\n3. Since each person has to carry the same number of bags grocerie, they have to make the same number of trips\n4. So total number of trips = total no. of bags each person can carry * number of trips that are required to carry each person's number of bags\n5. So for both groceries they require(9 * 10) trips in total, which adds up to 90 trips\n6. So the correct answer is 90 trips", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "1) To solve this question first we need a way to count the various layers of rock present in the canyon. 2) We first need to determine whether there are any duplicate elements - whether the same layer of rock has already been counted in the strata at any other location. If there are no duplicates, the strata will consist of exactly half as many layers of sandstone as there are layers of limestone, and each remaining layer will be of a different type of rock than the one preceding it. 3) Suppose there are 10 sandstone layers in the strata. Then, it is certain that the first five of those 10 layers are indeed limestone, since the first five are limestone. 4) We are now sure that 5+2+4+1+2+1=10 out 1=5 are limestone layers, and the other five (assuming there are 5 for simplicity) must each be different types of rocks. 5) We can say that the strata consists of exactly half of sandstone and half of different types of rocks. However, the type of rock that makes up just one more layer cannot be more than half of the total number of different rocks, since the remaining 4 layers must be different from sandstone. Thus, we can say that there are a total of 25 different rocks. 6) The strata must contain at least 2/5ths of the total, or 4/5 of the rock types. 7) Based on the above, the correct answer is 4.\nSo the final answers is 4", "answer": " 3"}

This information can be obtained from a sun dial.\n2- If the clock is always right if sun rises or sets, then the time on the clock will be the same as the time it is by the the sun. \n3- From this we can calculate time by the sun. This is done as follows:\n3a- By the sun: noon: = 12 hours\n3b- If the clock is right if the sun rrises or sets, the clock will always give the same time: Clock:Noon = the same as by the sun: Noon = 12 hours (Clock:Noon= by the sun: Noonie).\n4-We can then use this Clock:Noon to find the correct answer: \n5- Clock:Noon= 12 hours (from 3b); Clock:Noon-12 hours= 12 hours-12 hours=0 hours.

After determining the percentage of useable parking, it's then necessary to know how much parking space each car uses so you can calculate the number of spaces for each parking lot.\n5. To determine the amount of space each car needs, we divide 10 feet by 400 feet (the length of the lot), and we divide 10 by 500 (the width of the lot), and multiply these two numbers.\n6.

The statement does not provide enough information to determine how balloons are being blown up.

For example:\n  * The paintings would be wooden paintings, which are sold at a marked-down price.\n  * Likewise, the wooden toys would be either toys produced by wooden blocks or wooden toys that require painting.\n3) There's no need to understand the cost/price of either items because they differed in price but were both sold at a loss (marked down price to sell).\n4) The marked-down price of paintings would be $32, so Mr. Callen made $200 on his first 10 sales of paintings.\n5) His second line of sale would've been wooden toys. Again, the marked-down price for these would be $16, so Mr. C has made another $140 sale of 8 wooden toys.\n6) The difference could be calculated using this formula: 'Loss = (Marked-down price) - (Original selling price)'.\n7) The loss in this case is $40 for each remaining painting and $70 for the remaining set of 8 wooden toy.

This will be given in the question. It is given that Alison gave Anna half her collection in exchange for novel, and Anna traded Jeff two mountain stamps for this one mountain stamp. So how do we figure out exactly that Alison gave Anna her two bluebird stamps in exchange for her novel\n4)If Alison had 2X amount of stamps Anna had originally, then half of that means she kept half and gave the other half of her collection and that's 14.\n5)So, Alison had 14+ half of Anna's original stamps = 37 since she gave to Anna half of her original collection, 28, and half of Anna's 37, that in total is 14. So after this transaction Anna has two more than alison, so after this, Anns collection has 39 stamps.\n6)Now Anna gave two stamps of mountain to Jeff in exchange for one stamps of mountain. So after this transaction, she still has two more stamps of mountain and this means she still has 2 more stamps of mountain, so after this, Annas collection has 38 stamps.\n7)Now, since Anna had 2 more stamps in her collection previously, it means that Anna's original 37 stamps has become 39 now.\n8)[39+2= 41 stamps] After this transaction, the number of stamps Anna has in her collection is 41stamps.\nSo the final Answer is 41 stamps\n\nInput: What animal would you not need to use a helmet on?

From options C, D and E in the question, we can determine that there were at least a total of 45 pieces of candy that the floats threw out.\n3.) So the total number of candy pieces that Tabitha and her friends can catch is the total number of cindies that the floats can throw (45 pieces).\n4.) So the total number that Tabitha and hers friends catch is 45.\nSo the final number is 45\n\nInput: How many pieces of candy did Julie and her friends catch from the parade floats, if they caught half the amount of Tabitha, and Carlos caught twice the amount of Stan?\nOutput: \n1. The question asks about the total number of cydney thrown from the parade floors and how many pieces of candy the friends catch.\n2.  So we will figure out the total possible number of pieces of cydney thrown.\n3. We already know the total from the last question but this one has 3 more friend.\n4. So we can assume that there should be at least 45 pieces in total but since only 4 pieces are not know, they should sum up to 50.\n5. So the total number of candies would be 50 + 42 + 5 + 1 = 98 \n6.

So the answer is not '1.4L'.\n4: For 2 (but not for 3), the volume of water (5 L) would mean a container would not be empty when opened, but it would have insufficient capacity for other fluids. Since each container has a maximum capacity, the water would spill and violate the condition of equal volumes of beer and water that do not overflow. So the answer is not 5 L. \n5: For 4, the container is clearly too small to hold 46 litres of water. The condition of equal volumes of drinks must be satisfied and this violation is evident right away after opening the bottles. So the answer is \nnot 5 L.\n6: Option C, the container has sufficient capacity to accommodate all the given fluid volumes. For 4, the condition of equal volumes is satisfied and therefore the answer is option C: 55 L. \n7: After reading both statements, it becomes evident that the answer must satisfy the condition of being able to hold fluid volumes that equal to or more than 46 L. Option D violates this condition because the container can't hold 52 L, while option E satisfies this condition because it can hold at least 52 L. Therefore, the answer must be E  or greater, so the answer is option E: 52 L.\nSo the final answers are C = 55 L and E = 52 L", "answer": " 370"}

They are all asked about their pet ownership, and in this example we will use the variables x, y and z to represent these numbers.\n2. We can solve the question by understanding the individual contributions of each person.\n3. Consider the information first about Teddy: He owns 7 dogs and 7 cats.\n4. The information about his dogs is given as 7 + x (i.e. the number of dogs he has is more than Teddy's by x).\n5. We know that Teddy's cats are given as 7 + y (i.e. Teddy's cows are less than x by y and there are no other cats).\n6. Similarly, Dave's contributions are 7 + z (Dave has more cats than x by z and fewer dogs than Teddy by y)\n7. If we add up the number of dogs and cats that each person owns, we get:\nx + y + z = 31 dogs + 9 cats.\n8. Now we know how many dogs and cats each person owns, and the question can be rephrased as follows:\n\"In all, how many pets do all the three people have when added up?\"\n9. Let us do this calculation: There are 31 dogs and 9 cats that the three people have in total.\n10.

So what you actually want to figure out is how much more is this than 40 dollars. So we got to figure out a way of knowing how much 40 is. So let's just first try to convert it into a percent and divide that by 100. And in this case, if I want to convert it into a percentage, it's 40 divided by 650.

{"text": "To solve this question, the options need to be reduced to a manageable number and a few steps can help with this.\n1. Let's begin with the first option which is the total number of beads.\n2. The second option is the number of beads taken away from each part.\n3. The third option is the number of doubling done to each part.\n4. There is no need to reduce the last option as that is the number of bead in each part.\n5. Therefore, the question is to subtract each part to get the total number of bead remaining in each part.\n6. Let's look at the total number of beans.\n7.

First, the problem needs to be clearly defined by answering the question, what is the amount of grap the liquor store needs today?\n3. The first part of the question asks for the production per 6 months. Because one sixth of the production is every six months and two sixths for one year, that is how much production the liquor store needs every six months.\n4. Therefore, the liquor store needs to use 90 kilogram of grapes every six months.\n5. The second part of the question is: What should be a production increase by twenty percent? The increase is twenty percent of the current production. Twenty percent of ninety is eighteen, and fourteen more to get eighteen, equals two and six fifths(2.6). The total amount of grapes needed in a year after the increase of production is 9 + 2.6 = 11.6. Since three and a half is greater than or equals 2, the final number should be rounded to ten (10).\nSo the final answer has to be 6.1", "answer": " 216"}

Define the variables: \n* Height: the vertical distance from the soil to the tip of the sunflower. \n* Packet: a packet containing sunflower seeds.\n\n4. Identify the question: Given the height and the percentage of difference, calculate the height of the packet B.\n\n5. Find a percentage: the percentage of difference is calculated using the equation D% = [(height Packet B - height Packet A) / height Packet A)] * 100, where D represents the difference in percentage.\n\n6. Calculate the difference: The difference between the heights of the packets is (198 \u2013 170) = 28. The difference percentage for Packet B can be calculated using the equation D Packet B = [(height Packet A - height Packet B) / height Packet B) * 100], where D represents the difference. In this case, the difference percentage for Packet A is D Packet A = (20 \u2013 0) / 198 * 100 = 28 / 198 = 13.7% \n\n7. Convert the result: This difference percentage calculated above needs to be converted into feet. To do this, multiply the difference percentage by 100 and divide by 4, which will give the difference in feet. In this case, (13.7 x 100)/4 = 3.45 feet.\n\n8. Apply the results: The final height of Packet B can be determined using the formula Height Packet B= (Height Packet A x (1 + D / 100)) + D / 110.

He will need to play a game by a champion and 3 more games at his own pace. He needs 5 games total. How many games with a champion should he play in order to have 9 games total by the end of the week?\nOutput: To answer the question correctly, we first need to determine how much time John has to devote to each game.\nIn this case, we know that he will be playing 5 games altogether: 4 solo games and 1 game against a champion. \nTherefore, the total number of solo games he is able to play is 9/4=2.25.

{"text": "In order to answer this question, it is important to first understand what a commercial is. Commercials are typically advertisements on television or radio that promote a product or service. These ads try to persuade the audience to purchase the product or use the services being advertised. \nA 30-second commercial is usually long enough to provide the viewer/listener with enough information about the product or service, but if it is excessively long, people may become bored and tune out.\nThe goal of the question asks for Ursula to shorten her commercial by 30% and understand how long the commercial will be after she makes these changes.\nTo do this, we need to understand Ursula\u2019s original commercial, which is 30 seconds long. Then, we need to determine the percentage of Ursula's commercial after it is shortened by 30%. This can be done by taking the original length of 30 seconds and multiplying it by 0.7, which is equivalent to 30% of the original length. This gives us a new length of approximately 21 seconds.\nThen, we need to calculate how long the commercial will still be after Ursula has made the desired changes. To do this, we take the original length of the commercial and add the new length of approximately 15 seconds, which still leaves us with 15 seconds that are too short for airing.\nSo, the answer to this question would be that Ursula\u2019s commercial after she has shortened it by 30%, is approximately 21 seconds long.\n\nInput: Which of the following is the closest translation of the Spanish phrase 'Las dos'?

Therefore, for every minute that she sang, we need to know how much time has passed where she is practicing and throwing tantrams.\n8. One way to solve this is to take the total time (6 minutes) and divide it by the minutes per minute increment (8 = 3 + 5 [each increment of 1 minute is treated as 8 seconds] - this way the total time can be divided into those chunks).\n9. Since 6 / 8 = 1.25, she practiced and threw tantrms for at least 1.25 minutes.\n10. Then: 6 minutes of singing + 1.25 minute practicing and throwing tantamas = 7.25 minute total time\nSo the 7.25m", "answer": " 54"}

If Fiona did the same number of math questions as Kiana (which is twice what Fiona did), then Kiana would have solved 36 x 4 = 144 questions in their first hour.\n5. Similarly, since Shirley completed her quizzes twice as fast as Fiona, then Shirley's contributions to quizzes complete in an hour would be 36 x 8 = 288.\n6. From here, it's straightforward to see that Fiona's contribution to the first hour quizzes is 36 + Kiana's quizzes + Fiona's quizzes, which is 144 + 72 + 36 = 252.\n7. Shirley's contribution to the quizzes completed in hour 1 is 288 - Fiona's quiz, which is 252 - 36 = 159.\n8.

{"text": "(Assume shoe sizes are written from low to high, that is, lowest shoe size is written first, and highest shoe size is written last).\n1. The first task is to determine the lowest and highest shoe sizes for Alexa and Jasmine.\n2. It is known that Alexa's sho size is twice as big as Jazmine's.\n3. Also, Jazmine's shoe size was determined to be 7 in the input. This means that Alexa's shoe size must be higher than 7 but less than 14 in order for the statement that Alexa's feet are twice as big as hers to be true.\n4. Therefore, the minimum and maximum shoe size for Alexa and Jazmine are 8 and 13 respectively.\n5. Let's denote shoes sizes of Jazmine and Alexa as x and y respectively. The statement that \"Alexa's shoes were twice as big as Jaspine's shoes\" can be rephrased as 2x = y which is an equation that has solutions x+y=14 and x-y= 2. \n6. Based on the given options, the highest combined shoe size for Alex and Jazmine should be less than 77 which is the maximum shoe size we can get if we add 2x+y (the combined shoe size of Alex and Jazmine) to 14 (the value of x). Hence, this combined shoe size is either 53 or 33.\n7. There were only two options for x (5 and 1): x = 5 is the best combination option based on the given shoes sizes as this combination yields the sum of 53 (which is less than 77) for the combined shoe size 8 + 5.\n8. Since there were two options for y (8 and 13), the sum of their combinations yields the sum of 30 (which is less than the maximum shoe size possible, 77).\n9. So, the final answer is the maximum of x and y, which is 8.\nSo the final answers is 8, because the highest shoe size that Alexa could have is 13.

Given the variables (the number of hours he studies for the SAT exams) and the constraints (the number of days for him to study each night and the number of hours per night he studies) it's straightforward to arrive at the number of hours Joey will spend studying per week:\n(2 x 7) + (5 x 2) = 14 + 10 = 24 hours per week he will spend studying.\n3. To answer the question, we need to convert the hours per week to a time span in days.

To do that, we can divide the total cost of 3 pizzas by the number of slices they have.\n3- The cost of a single slice is $72/12 = $6 per slice. To calculate the cost of 5 pieces, we can multiply the $6 per 1 slice with 5.\n4- To find the least expensive option, we need to consider which choice is higher than the $72, and which choice is below. The two lower options $20 and $25 will not be enough to cover the cost of the 3 ordered pizzas, and option A at $6 is what is needed, so $5 = $6 - $1 will cost $5 for 5 slices or $0.20 per piece.\nSo the final equation is 0.20 per 5 slices\nSo the final answer of 'How much did 5 sliced cost?' is 5*0.20(0.20)=1\n\n\nInput: In the diagram below, what is the minimum value of \ud835\ude2f that can be represented?

{"text": "1. Before arriving at the answer, there are several clues we can analyze to eliminate some options.\n2. The question refers to Mariel and her pack of dogs, so we know that there are multiple dogs being walked.\n3. The word 'pack' means that there may be several dogs of the same species walking together.\n4. The word 'leashes' suggests that the dogs are wearing  collars, thus the type of collars can be determined.\n5. The clues from the question indicate that there are likely dogs of multiple breeds, which can be further narrowed down by considering the type of leashes they\u2019re wearing.\n6. 'Tangled up' can refer to the collars of the individual dogs being caught together, but there are other clues that suggest this is a situation involving multiple people and collars of  multiple dogs. \n7. In this context, 'tangled up' could also refer to the collars on a single dog's neck, indicating that there is just one dog with collars wrapped around its neck along with other collars.\n8. The statement: She gets tangled up in leashed of another dog walker.  There are 46 legs tangled up makes one of these options even more plausible\n9. So, if there are 46 legs total, and Mariel has 1 of them, that would leave 45 dogs being walked by the other dog walker.\n10. If we assume that each dog has multiple collars, this means that there are actually 126 collars to begin with, 36 less than what is needed to account for Mariel's presence.\n11.

The question is basically a comparison problem between Jenny and Mike in terms of how many chocolates they each ate.\n2. We have to find out how many chocolatess Jenny ate if the number of chocolarates Mike ate was already given, that is 25.\n3. The formula that can be used to find out the answer is 5 * 3 + 25, where 5*3 denotes the number of chocols that Jenny would have eaten if Mike didn't eat them and +25 indicates that Jenny would have consumed these extra 25 chocolate squares as well.\n4. After deriving the formula, we also have to determine the value of the letter 'x', which indicates the number of chocolas Jenny ate.\n5. To determine the value of x, we substitute 5(3) for the numbers of chocolates that Mike ate in the equation and find the final value of 'x'.\n6. We now see that 'x' stands for the value 20, meaning that Jenny ate 20 more than thrice the amount of chocolates Mike ate, that is 20 more than 75.\n7.

To answer the question, we need to know the number of trees, the average weight of fruit per tree, and the number of apples and peaches produced by each type of tree.\n3. We can obtain this information from a simple calculation using the given data to get the total mass of fruit in the orchard:\n4. First, we calculate the total number of trees in the orchard: 30 apple trees + 45 peach tree = 75 trees.\n5. Next, we get the average weight of each fruit in the orchard by dividing the total mass of fruit produced by each type of fruit (690 kg of apples + 307.5 kg of peaches) by the number of fruit produced by each:\n6. The apple tree gives an average weight of 69/150 = 0.46 kg, while the peach tree gives an average weight 307.4/65 = 4.73 kg.\n7. Finally, we multiply the total mass of each type of fruit produced by each individual tree, and add them together to get the total mass:\n8. The total mass of fruit produced in the orchard is 75 peach trees x 0.46/1 kg + 75 apple trees x 4.73/1 kg = 847.44 kg.\n9.

Choices:  M: rope A: ladder B: bridge C: scaffold\nOutput: 1] Rope would be a medium through which a load is moved, so if you have a long enough neck, that is, if you are a Giraffe or an Emu, then you don't need a rope to lift something at all. So, M is incorrect.\n2] Scaffold would be for building something at a high level, but giraffes can also stand high on their own two legs without any support. So, C is incorrect.\n3] A bridge would have to have some sort of support on which it can be supported. Giraffes don't need any such support. \n4] A ladder would be the most similar, but a ladder itself is an independent tool that needs to be put somewhere to be of any use. Giraffes often have to climb trees for safety, but their height doesn't require the use of ladders any further than just for safety.\nSo, we are left with an option B.\nSo, the answer is B: Bridge.\nSo the final correct answer has to be B.

The first staircase had 20 steps, the second one had 41 steps, and the third one had 30 steps.\n3. At each staircase, we need to identify the lengths of the steps, i.e., the height of each stair.\n4. For the first staircase, each step was 0.5 feet (i.e. 0.5 feet = 0.5m) in height.\n5. The second staircase had 41 steps so, the height of each step was 05 *41 = 2.05 m \n6. And the third staircase was made of 30 steps, so the height of each step would be 0.5 *30 = 1.5 m.\n7. We can now summarize the facts as follows:\na. A step was 0. 5 m for all three staircases.\nb. The first stair had 20 steps and the height of each step is therefore 20*.5 = 20/2 =10 ft.\nc. The second stair had 41 steps therefore, the height of each is (41)*0.5 = 20.5 ft.\nd. The third stair had 30 steps therefore, the height is (30)*0.5 =15ft.\n8.

Yola (current weight - 2 years ago weight) 2 years ago weight = W. Yy + Wanda current weight (Wanda weight - 2 years current Yola's weight) 2 years current Yolaw = W\n4. Therefore: X2 + X4 = W and we can solve for X2 as follows: X2 = W/2 W = 1204\n5. Hence, Wanda weighs 50 pounds more than Yolaw's previous weight.

{"text": "In order to solve this problem, we need to understand how the question is phrased. It asks how long the grill ran, and is not interested in how many coals the grill used.\n1. One of the numbers given in the question is 'twenty minutes'. It is possible to grill for at least 20 minutes between running out of coals and needing to refill.\n2. From the context of the question, it is suggested that the grill ran 'for long enough to burn three whole bags of coals'. It would be reasonable to assume that the grill did not run continuously for the full 20 minutes, since 60 is a lot of coals for one whole bag.\n3. A total of 60 coals were used in one whole bag, which means that three whole bags were needed to run for the full 29 minutes, and this can be rearranged to find the time taken.\n4. The grill ran long enough to burn three full bags of coals with 60 coals in each. From the problem, we can see that 60 full coals take 20 minutes to burn down to ash, so 60 coals divided by 20 (the time taken to burn one bag of coals containing 60 coals) equals five bags.\n5. By plugging in 'twenty' in the formula to find the number of bags, the answer is 11. This means that the grill ran for eleven twenty-minute sessions.

{"text": "1) Here we can solve the problem by looking at it in terms of numbers of kilograms instead of weight.\n2) We are given that there are four people who have lost 103 kilos in total.\n3) The first person has lost 27 kilos and the second person has lost 7 kilos less than the first person (27 - 7 = 20).\n4) However, this doesn't give any information about the other two persons, who may have lost equal amounts or maybe not.\n5) However, the given statement tells us that the weight lost by the two remaining persons is equal.\n6) Therefore, we can find that 20 + x = y is necessary.\n7) Now from 27 x + x = 103 it can be found that x = 73 and x = 79 will work (199 + 29 = 228).\n8) So, 228 kg is actually lost by the other two persons.\n9) Now from 228 - x = y, x = 29 kg or 30 kg will work (228 - 30 = 200 or 200 - 29 = 171).\n10) Therefore the final answer is that \"30 kg\" is lost by each of the remaining two persons.\nSo the final 2 answers are 30 kg and 29 kg\n\nInput:A 3'6\" man's wife stands 2\" taller than him.

{"text": "1.. In this type of algebra puzzle, we need to make a mathematical formula in order to find the required quantity.\n2. First, let us try to determine how many gumballs Hector purchased by eliminating outcomes.\n3. We can eliminate Alisha because Alisha received 4 fewer than twice as many as she received from Hector (i.e., -2x4), so Alisha's original quantity of gumballs has been given away (i.e., 4x4 = 16).\n4. Second, we can eliminate Bobby because Bobby was given twice as many as Todd was initially given (i.e., x2) but x is not 4. This means that Todd was initially given fewer than 4 gumballs, or 0. This means that Bobby was given 0-4 gumballs but 6 gumball were given to Bobby, so Bobby received at least 6 gumball.\n5. Therefore, 4 was the minimum quantity given to Todd, so Hector initially purchased at least 6 gummies (i.e. 6 + 4 = 10).\n6. However, the problem states that Hector had 6 remaining gumballs after he handed them out.\n7. We cannot have a situation where the total number at the end equals the total number used so the number of gumball used must equal the minimum number given to Todd.\n8. We can eliminate Hector because there are only two options. Therefore, the answer must be D. Hector gave 4 to Tod, 2x as many as given to Tod to Alisha, then 5 less than 4 times as many as given to Alisha to Bobby.\n9. Therefore, Hector purchased 10 gumball in total, then gave 4 to Tod's.

A = 25 km/h (kilometers per hour) B = 27 km/h C = 32 km/h D = 35 km/h E = 41 km/h\n4. We can eliminate answer choices B and C as these are both higher than 25 km/hr. This means that choice B can be replaced by choice D and choice C can be replaced by choice E.\n5. The answer should be E: 41 km/hr. Jerome should ride this speed for 125 kilomters on his 12th day to complete 150 kilometres.

{"text": "Let's begin by considering the different prices and types of garden flowers Simon purchased. The pansies are $2.50 per flower, hydrangeas cost $12. The petunias are sold in bundles of 10 and go for $0.10 per flower.\n1.  So, Simon bought 1 hydrangea, 5 pansies, and 10 petunias. \n2. The money he paid ($50) doesn't include tax if there is any.\n3. 1) How much is his $50 bill worth with tax? We need to look at each choice in turn to make a decision.\nThe hydrangea is the most expensive item here, and it costs $12.5, which means that Simon paid tax on its purchase. Since Simon didn't buy the hydrangea and the pansies, but his order contained the flowers, he will get a partial refund of tax which is the difference between the tax paid to buy the hydrangea ($1) and the tax paid on the total value of his flower purchase ($7.25).\n4. Total cost of the flowers bought by Simon is 17.5 $. \n5. Total sales tax paid on the flowers purchased is 1.56 (7.25 rounded down).\n6. Total refund for the tax is 1.5.\n7. With the tax refund, Simon needs to pay $50 minus the refund, i.e. $50-1.5 = $48.50.\n8. Now, the total amount needed to pay is $50 minus $1.56, i.e. 48.44.\n9. So, the change that Simon would get is\n10. 0.56.\nOutput:Simon bought 2 hydrangeas, 5 pansy, and 10petunias. \nSo, we need to find out the cost of each item in total.\n1.  How much does Simon's bill cost with tax, since he isn't buying just one item and will have to pay for them all in one go? \nThe hydrangea costs about 12.5 plus the tax paid.\nSimon's purchase will have to cover the hydrangea as well along", "answer": " 23"}

A second solution is to compute as follows: 60min/45min per hour of cardio 7.5  Hours of cardio per day 7.5/3 = 2.5 hours 2.5 X 3 days per week = 7.5 hours in the gym. 7.5 hours = 1.5 hours. 3.A third alternative would be: (1+3/3)x3 X 3 days = 10.5  Finally, an alternative 4th method of finding the answer with these clues would be to subtract how long he is working at the gym from how long he is at the gym. We know how long he works at the gym. He is dedicated and diligent so he sticks to the time allotted for lifting weights with an additional x amount of time he dedicates to warming up and cardio. He doesn't work too hard but he does well enough. He has a 9 to 5 job and doesn't work late, so we know he works at the gm 3 times a week for approximately 2 hours on each day.  2/3 of a hour is equal to 45 minutes. 45 minutes (45 minutes = 0.75 of an hour) 90 minutes divided by 2 45 minutes= 10 hours, so he spends 10 and a half  hours at the gym for a 3 day week.  7.5 Hours + 7.5 Hours+(0.75 x 7.5 hours) X 7.5 HOURS=10 hrs\nThat means he spends (360 min / 45 min per hour of cardio) 1.35 hours in the gm 3 days per weak  and (1hour + (3/3))x60 2 hours\n\nSo in conclusion, the solution to the problem is 1.53 \n\nInput: When someone wears clothes, they are", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "1) 1. First we need to establish Karen and Kevin\u2019s given information.\n\nKaren\u2019s work bag is twice the weight as Kevin\u2019s work bag when Kevin\u2019s work bag is empty. That is the first relationship, so 1x2 = 2x1. Kevin\u2019s work bag contains his laptop and work papers, and his laptop is a 6th of the total weight of his filled work bag. That\u2019s the second variable, 1/6 = 6/1.\n\n2) Now we need to apply the second variable to the x value to determine the weight of each bag. x = 2x1 + 6/1, then (2x1 + 1/6) = x.\n\n3) The weight of x bags = 2(x1 + 1) = x. From there, we can determine that 2(6) = x, which means that we are working in pounds.\n\n4) The weight of one bag is 8, so (2x6) = 2x8 = 16 pounds.\n\n5) If Kevin\u2019s laptop weighed 16 pounds instead of 8 pounds, then we know that Kevin\u2019s laptop is 1/4 as heavy as Karen\u2019s work bag.\n\n6) Now we need to calculate the weight of each bag without first establishing their weights. Kevin\u2019s laptop weigs 5 pounds. Karen\u2019s workbag weighs 8. Kevin\u2019s workbag weigs 13 pounds.\n7) And, since Kevin is the husband, 13 = the weight of one bag.

Choices: 2 hours, 2 miles, 2 years, 2 months, 2 days, 2 weeks, 2 weeks, minutes, 43 years, 37 months, 20 hours, seconds, 5, years?\nOutput: It would be helpful to identify the units given to each of the answers. '2 hours' = 2 x 60 minutes = 120 minutes, '2 weeks' = 30 days = 720 hours, '37 months' = 30 x 3 = 90 months, and '5 years' = 365.25 days = 192309 hours. \nOption A = 2 hours: 120 minutes to the airport = 2 hours. Option B. 60 miles. To convert miles to kilometres follow this rule: 1 mile = 1.60934 kilometre. So 180 miles = x km. So, x = 180 x 1.60894. So 60 miles is approximately 97 km. Option C. 2 years: 2 years = 1461 days. 1461 x 24 x 60 = 45,902 x 60 =63,906,800 x 60 =3,818,816 minutes. So the answer is B.

{"text": "Let's first note that 15 is almost as large as 16, so the 15 minute recess won't come up.\nTo simplify the problem, let's assume Roberto can skip four times per second. Roberto can jump for 4 hours. Each time he jumps, Valerie can jump too! If she could jump for one minute straight, she could jump for 80 minutes straight. Now to do the math! There are 120 jumps in every hour since 20 minutes is 300 seconds and there are 20 jumps per a minute, Val will miss 450 seconds until the end of an hour, so, in an hour she can skip two minutes and 450 seconds (2350) times(this is all the seconds in an hour). Now to add them up, Roberto jumps 4 times per second. If that continued, by that time, he skipped eight hours. Add them up! 4 times per second, skipping for 8 hours (48) and you get 432 times in that. Val skipped 2 times in the first hour, because of that, he will skipped 4 times for 78 times each, so, since Roberto can skip 8 hours and Valerie can skip 2 hours and 432 seconds, Roberto can skip eight times for 78 seconds, so they'll skip together 435 times and 78 seconds.

Mark has a total of 10 days to use in a year, which means he is allowed to use 2 days a month at a maximum.\n3. He uses half of his sick days and half of his vacation days, which is equivalent to 1 day per month.\n4. This means that Mark has a total of: 20/2 = 10 vacation day\n5. This also means that he has a total of: (20+10)/2 = 15 sick days. \n6. Mark used 10 days in total which is the same as 5 days of sick and 5 days of vacation days. From the information given, it is obvious that 5/20 (5/2 is the same as 125%) = 1/25 (or 4%). Multiplied with 8 (number of hours in a day). This gives us 1/25 x 8 = 2 hours 35 minutes.

What this means is that when the number of gifts he received on his 13rth birthday is subtracted from the number of gifts on his 5th birthday, he had an 8-gift decrease.\n4.

Hopefully you understand what I'm doing. Let's go ahead and solve this. so We set it equal to y.\n0 > 2y <= 8 So y > 2 we have the inequality >. then y <= 8 This is going to be our lower bounded equation. then we add 2+3 to our y we need to subtract 9 from y. if you're doing your math you must have gotten y = 11.

The total number of bars that were sold was 125, and the bars were of four different types, which were Milk, Dark, Milk Chocolate with Almonds and White, which are all present in roughly 1:1:1:1 ratios.\n7. Since 40% of 125 is 48, if 40% is the ratio of milk chocolate to dark chocolate, then, 3(40) = 48, and 6(40) =144, which indicates that there were 48 dark chocolate and 144 white chocolate bars available for sale. \n8. 64 bars are milk chocolate with a percentage of 80% which is 56 bars, and 40 bars are milk chocolates with a percentage of 50% which is 20 bars. \n9.

Also, Zika virus infected mosquitos are 20% of all mosquitos in Jacks area, 37.5% of Zika virus infected population will be infected with Malaria.\n7.

Choices:  A 100 foot long cable B 60 foot long cable C 80 foot long cable D 40 foot long cable E None of the above\nOutput: There is an equation that can be used to calculate the minimum wire rope length. Minimum wire length = 1.31xCable length.  A 10' cable has a length of 10 feet = 10x14 ft = 140 ft.  A 60' cable has a cable length of 60 ft = 60x14 ft 1200 ft (1600 ft available in a 200 ft long cable).  A 80 ft cable has a cable length 80x14 ft= 1120 ft, this will need to be multiplied by 1.31 the result is 1484 ft.  A 40 ft cable has a length of cable of 40 x 14 = 560 ft.

There are no costs for selling a bike.\n2.James sells his bike for 80% ($720) of the cost of what he bought (80% $500 = $500).  This leaves him with a sale value of $1700.\n3. Since he sold for 80% and bought for 20% (it's better to think about this as buying for 80% discount), there is a cost of 20% of the remaining amount.  Since the first amount is $3700 ($3000 + $700) and this 20% cost is $740 ($3700 * 0.2 = 740), the overall cost is $4440.

{"text": "1) First, we need to break down the steps she takes into a sequence of operations. 2) 12 \u00d7 12 = 144 (the 12 squares that make up the dough) 3) Each square is 3 \u00d7 3, so there are a total of 36 squares of dough (42 \u2212 6). 4) There must be rectangles of equal dimensions across the dough, so the smaller unit area is 3 \u00d7 1 and the larger unit area is 1 \u00d7 3. 5) So, in the 12 \u00d7 42 inch dough, there are a total of (36)/(12 \u00d7 1) = 300 sq inches of smaller unit area and a total of (3 \u00d7 42 )/ (1 \u00d7 42) inch^2 = 12 sq inches of larger unit area. 6) Using the formula, we have n = A / (b \u00d7 h), we can find the number of biscuits by arranging the equation with the dimensions given. 7) There are (36 units of smaller area) / (3 \u00d7 h and 12 sq inches bigger area) = 82 square inches of additional area (bigger area) to add, then take this area and divide it by 3 inches (bigger area's thickness), and you get 74.3 biscuits (number of smaller unit areas that fit in one bigger unit area). 8) To write an equivalent decimal form, we can multiply 74.3 with (120 inches)/(42 inch), which is approximately 1.73. 9) Therefore, the answer is approximately 1.8.

{"text": "1) First, we need to determine how many cookies are baked in each tray. This can be done by simplifying the equation of the problem: 30 cookies total x 6 days = 180 cookies total.\n2) We then need to determine how many of the 180 cookies are consumed by Frank, Ted, and Frank himself (the one he eats per day). By deducting the amount of cookies that ate in a day, which is 1 for Frank and 4 for Ted, we get: 180 total cookies =176 cookies, which leaves 4 cookies.\n3) From here, it is logical to conclude that 12 cookies were baked into each tray, since there are enough cookies left to distribute to people after baking each tray. Therefore, 12 cookies were made per tray.\n4) We can then use basic mathematics to determine how many cookies were left over. 6 days x 12 cookies each = 72 cookies. Therefore, Frank baked 6 trays of cookies total, with 72 cookies remaining.\nSo the final answe is C: 72 cookies left\n\nInput: What is that makes the number 99 prime in grade mathematics?

However, 99 only has 1 and 97 as its factors, so option 1 is incorrect.\n2: The number 99 can be written as a multiplication of two numbers:  2 x 2 x 2 x3 x 3 x 9. Option 2 is an incorrect answer because 99 cannot be written as 2 x  2 * 2 x3 * 3 x 9, and we cannot eliminate any choices because all the numbers are single digits\n3: An incorrect answer because 2 x 99 is actually 198, not 99.\n4: As stated in our solution for the previous question, option 4 is incorrect because", "answer": " 134"}

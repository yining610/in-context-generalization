To do this, we'll use the `Object.assign` function.\n\n```\nlet newOccupation = Object.assign(object.occupation);\nnewOccupation.name = \"Doctor\";\nnewOccupation. age = 47;\n```\n\nTherefore our new data looks like this:\n\n```\nInput2: {\n      \"Name2\": \"Mustaf\",\n      \"Age2\": \"39\",\n      \"state2\": \"AZ\",  \n      \"occupation2\": {\n        \"Name\": \"Doctor\",\n        \"Age\": 47 \n      }\n    };\n```\n\nWe can test that the new data we just made is correct by getting the `name` field and comparing to the original data - which is `Mustafa` not `Mustaf`. \n\n![](./new-data.png)\n\nHowever, notice that there is now another `objects` field to deal with.

People may pay different amounts for these services (in dollars) based on their income. The income may have been determined recently or in the past. People may make more or less income sometimes. A person may or may not go to the salon at least once for each paycheck. The person may have many of their hair paying off in a lump sum or pay on a monthly basis. If you look at the amount people paid for these services over the year, how would you describe the trend lines? Choices: A: The first thing to look at is the total amount of money that each person spent on hair services over the course of a year. The horizontal line would be the horizontal axis, which shows the amount of money each person spends over a calendar year. The vertical axis would be income, so you could consider each person's yearly income and what it was spent on from year to year. The trend of spending that you would use to predict each person's future spending would be their total annual income divided by any paycheck they received during the year. For example, if I have a total yearly income of $80,000 and I receive 24 paychecks, I would have approximately $3,500 of my yearly income coming in over the course of a calendar year (I would receive an average of $133 every paycheck). My annual income is 32 times smaller than my paychecks. It seems like my total annual income over 24 paycheck", "answer": " 36"}

The distance between you and your friend can be measured with a unit of time called \"time distance\". It is one time distance long between you and your friend if it takes you each one time to meet with your friend in-person. For example, when you and your friend decide to measure distance in \"time distance\" you may want to agree on that a unit of time distance will always be one. At the end of time 3 you decide to stop walking and sit down to take a break. Your friend then continues walking for a duration of time d. It is time distance d between you and your friend after your friend walked for duration d. This is because \"time distance\" is defined as \"one time\". After your friend walks for time d, you start walking again. You decide to walk a distance of t+2 time distance from the point you started walking before your friend walked. After walking t+2 time distance, and being a distance of time distance t+2 from the point you started, you finish walking for time d. Because you started walking from time distance t+2, you continue walking for a duration of (t+4). After (t+4), you finish walking and return to the point you started at.\nOutput:After your friend walks for duration d, you start walking. You decide to walk the sum of t time distance and d time distance from the point at which you started walking before your friends friend walks (t+2 time distance). After finishing of this walk (t+2 time + d time distance distance), you continue walking. You started walking from t+2 and completed a walk of duration (t+4) after which you returned to your starting point. Sum of distance is: d(t+2)", "answer": " 220"}

{"idx": 979, "text": "30\n```\n\n#### Solution\n\nWe use the Python `range` function.\n\nThe `range` function returns a sequence of `n` objects using the list comprehension syntax (list of list, [1,4,7,10]).\n\n```\nrange = 3\nOutput: [3, 6, 9]\n```\n\nThen use Python `zip` function to extract the middle value.\n\n```\na, b, c = zip(range, range, range)\n# a: range first\n# b: range second\n# c: range third\noutput = (sum(range)-sum(zip(a,b,c)))/3\n```\nThe zip is used here to subtract the list of first, second and third value from the overall total. When we add those three list, we will get the total list, so the third part is always 1.\n#### Output\n\n```\na = 4, b = 1, c = 3\nsum(a) = 5\nsum(b) = 3\nsum = (3 - 5) / 2 = -1.\nThe list [1,4,5], contains 5 items but the answer is 8.\n```", "answer": " 44"}

C: May be\nOutput: D: Yes\n\n### Explanation:\n\nDex (the main character) was the most knowledgeable person on the planet: he lived in a room of learning and could learn whatever subjects he desired, at a rate of 300% efficiency.Dex had just finished 25 courses in 6 months which amounted to a total educational time of roughly 2.3 years.\n\nBased on this data, it is safe to say that we can find whatever subject we desire at a particular level and the time it takes us to learn it is independent of the subject.\n\n#### Exercise:\n1-2: Dex learned the answers to the grade math questions in all of his courses within the first day of the course. He also has a photographic memory. We can assume that he could probably learn any other course's grade math questions and answer them the same as he did in his courses. Therefore, these grade math questions are independent.\n\n3-5: Each course's grade math question has the same structure, so the information required to solve the question is also independent.\n\n6-8: Grade math questions A and B have the same answer, so the information needed to find the answer is independent of the question number. Grade math questions C and D also have the same answer, but this is irrelevant because it doesn't add information to question numbers A or B.\n\n#### Exercises:\n 9: Dex had 25 courses in six months. Since each course takes 1 month to complete, this information is not independent because the course length is required to learn one course, so we don't know the length if each course. Because the courses have the same structure and are independent, our result is incorrect.\n\n10: Dex has a photographic memory like we stated in our first exercise. We need more information to understand that Dex learned math questions A-B in the first day of the given courses because he needs to have time to complete the course, but he finished 3", "answer": " 4500"}

Why do I need mathematics?\nMathematics is one of the world's core subjects. As is, it is taught from Primary to Higher Education, and also, it prepares learners for life in modern societies. It involves problem solving, reasoning, and analysis, which are key skills for people in nearly every occupation.\n\nMaths prepares learners for the world of work: \nMathematics helps people make sense of data and the changing world around them. It helps them interpret and analyse data,  and draw conclusions and make judgements based on it. There is an ever-increasing demand from employers for graduates who can understand, analyze, and use data.\nMaths makes people smarter: \nFor starters, it develops the brain skills needed for problem-solving and logical thinking, and it boosts their self-confidence. It also helps people develop their reasoning and communication skills, and it helps them learn to think critically and to construct logical arguments.\nMaths inspires curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking: \nLearning Maths promotes curiosity and creativity by introducing people to new concepts and ideas, and by allowing them to explore new ways of thinking. It also encourages them to solve problems with a range of methods, which develops their flexibility and ability to think critically and independently.\nMaths improves people's performance in other subjects: \nStudies have shown that when learners study Maths subjects, their performance in other subjects improves too. For example, learners who study Maths A/L have strong basic skills that make them more successful in their ICT and Science studies.  It also helps them to develop mental math, which means they develop the ability to work quickly and accurately with numbers.", "answer": " 123"}

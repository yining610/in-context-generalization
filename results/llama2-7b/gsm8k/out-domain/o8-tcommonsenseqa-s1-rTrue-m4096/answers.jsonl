{"idx": 4, "text": "This type of question is very common for GMAT math questions and is commonly referred to as PEAC question. PEAC stands for Pages Equal To. The concept is straight forward : if Julie reads so many pages today and she wants to be halfway through the book by tomorrow, she can do it by reading so many pages tomorrow. Hence, a PEAC question. This is also a good question if you are practicing the same.\n1. Julie is reading a 80 page book and yesterday, she read 12 pages. So, yesterday's total is 80 + 12 = 92 pages\n2. If she read twice as many yesterday, then today's total was 92 * 2 = 184 pages\n3. Tomorrow, she needs to read how many pages to be halfway? It has to be 184/2 = 92. So, tomorrow's total is 286 pages.\n4. So, she needs to read 286 - 184 pages = 102 pages\n5. So, now she still needs to read 102 pages. So, if she can read half of these, she can finish the reading by tomorrow. Half of 102 is 51 (rounded to 2 digits). So, she needs to finish reading in 5 days = 60 * 5 -1 = 290 - 1 pages.\n6.

We can eliminate options B, D and A because the question mentions that Ken added two pounds of jelly beams, and those two pounds increase the total weight of the package by 100%, which makes the total weight 2 pounds.  So, the total weight of the box equals two.  We also know that Ken added more brownies, so the total weight increases by more than 100%, not just 100%.  So, the total value is more than 2 pounds, and cannot equal 2.  Option B is also less than option D.  We know that the weight triples, as Ken adds brownie, and then quadruples, as he adds gummy worms.  Therefore, total weight equals 16 pound.  So option A is the correct answer; the final weight of the package is 16 pounds.\nSo the final weight of the goodies in pounds is A: 16.\n\nInput: A large group of people, who were trying to see the sunrise gather to witness the sun setting.

We can use the formula: pages * hours = minutes. Using this formula, we can determine how many minutes it would take to read each page, then use the total minutes to determine how many hours it would require to read the desired number of pages.\n3: Let us examine the formula page * hour = minutes.\n4: If we have 8 pages and let us assume that we read them 20 minutes each. Then, this can be expressed as: 8 * 20 = 160 minutes. Or, if we want to express it per page, simply, 8 * 25 = 200 minutes. \n5: For example, 120 pages = 60 * 20 = (126 * 25) = 3100 minutes.\n6: Thus, we require around 3.17 hours to read 126 pages.\n7: By this reasoning, we could deduce that Joy can read 120 of pages in around 3.2 hours.\n8: So the answer is C: the fraction of 7.5 (which is the answer between the hours of 2 and 3.5), which represents the fraction of time in one hour between 2 and 3 (60 minutes / 1 hour = 6 minutes / 1 hour). 7.5 * 60 = 3.125, implying that Joy would take 3.2 hours (rounded up) to complete the task and we can confirm our answer by checking.\n9: Thus, the answer is B, or 0.25.\nSo the final answers are B,0.25.", "answer": " 5"}

{"idx": 23, "text": "1. The question wants us to determine how many letters are in Sammetha's last name. \n2. It requires us to find a sequence of steps that will lead to the answer. \n3. The question starts with an inequality, in which Jamie's last name is compared to Bobbie's last name. We can conclude from this fact that Bobbie's last is longer than Jamie's last. \n4. We are then told that Bobbie's name has three fewer letters. We don't know how this number is calculated, but it's reasonable to assume that it is compared with Jamie's last, and we can conclude that Jamie's name has two more letters than  Bobbie's name. \n5. From these two pieces of information we can now determine how many letters are Sam's last name. The question doesn't provide us with Bobbie's entire name, but it does tell us that Sam's last name has two more letters. Since we can conclude from the inequality that Jamie's last is two letters shorter than Bobbie's, the number of letters in Jamie's name is therefore two letters longer than Bobbie's.  However, Sam's last name must be two letters longer than Jamie' as indicated by the word 'twice' in the question.  This gives us a sequence of steps.  i.e (1) Bobbie's last has two more letters than Jamie's, (2) Bobbie's has two fewer letters than Sam's, and (3) Jamie's is two letters fewer than Sam's. \n6. Therefore, to find the number of letters in Sam's last name, it suffices to add up the three numbers given in the inequality: (2) - 1.

They are feet, yard, centimetres, millimetres, meters, kilometres.\nStep 4: Eliminate all probable options. As per the question 4 feet + 4 feet = 8 feet. So this 8ft can be represented as 129.6cm (since cm = 100 times the value of the feets) or as 1.296m (since m = 1000 feets). So, any of these 4 options can be taken in calculation.

This depends on the hourly pay\n3) Now, the question reads that he earns $20 per hour in his main job, so what is the total amount he will earn in his main job per week?\ni.e. 30 hours = 30 x $20 = $600 per week.\n\n4) Now lets see the same amount as $600 he will earn in first job\n5) Now the question also reads that he earns 20 percent less money while working the second job.  So in this second job he would earn 20% of first job's income, i.e.  (1/2)  $600\n6) Now the total number of hours he is spending in main and Second job puts his earnings at $600+$600 = $1200, which is the total amount he earns in a week.\n7) So $1200 /80 hours = $15 per hour, which is the amount he earns during the week.\n8) Hence he earns $15 x 80 hours = $6000 per week.

A down payment is made up of the initial amount that is paid and then whatever remaining months are needed to get the full price owed.\n3. To solve this question, we first calculate the number of months needed after the down payment has already been made - this is our \"after the down payment\" months. We do this by adding the total number of installments/months needed to get the full amount owed ($1000) with the number of months given.\n4. We then subtract this to get the months left - $1000/65 - 4, meaning Tara has paid for approximately 15 months (rounded up) by making this down payment.\n5. So, we subtract this amount from the initial number of installments - 4 months. This gives us the remaining balance after the $20 is paid.\n6.

The question asks you to find the maximum possible after you have selected all coins from those 4.\nStep 2: Eliminate the impossible choices to bring the problem to its minimal level.\n\nStep 3. Solve the problem and obtain the answer.\n\nStep 1: We can eliminate (1) quarters and (2) a quarter and a dime. We get this from the context where the number of quarters is less than 1(as said before there are 3 possible total). So that option is ruled out. Also, we know that the question wants to get the highest total and a quarter is obviously the lowest. So we don't need (2).\n\nStep 2 : We are left with (3). We know that (3) is also not possible as there is a nickel and a nickel is bigger, heavier, and longer than a dime and a quarter is smaller than a dime. \n\nSo the final answer will be 1. which is the highest one.\n\nInput: To use your credit/debit card, which of the following is correct?

Given the size of the two tanks, if one fish is two inches (four inches total) in size and the second tank is smaller than the first, Gail would have to add more fish to the first tank to reach the one gallon per inche rule.\n3. She has two options: She can add more small fish to the second tank to bring it up to one gallon per inched, but that would mean she has fewer fish; or, in order to keep the rule, she can add more big fish to the first tank.\n4. If this is the choice, we can assume that the second tank is small enough that it can hold one fish per gallon. Then, how many small fish are there in the second tank?\n5. There are 40 gallons in the second tank. 40/1=40. Thus, there is one fish in the second tank.\n6. Therefore as there will be 2-inch fish in the tank, a 2-inch fish eats 2-inch fish.\n7. So, she will have 2 gallons of fish remaining after fish eating occurs.\n8. That leaves 40 gallons of fish in the second tank, which means that she has to add an additional 2 gallons.\n9. In the first tank, she has 48 gallons, meaning that she has to add 6 gallons of fish.\n10.

Choices:  the same  unique  ordinary  the opposite  correct\nOutput: The word that is appropriate to describe what a waddling penguin looks like is \"ordinary\".\nThis is because all the provided words mean the opposite of what a penguin's appearance is.\nE.g. \"same\" means the same as the penguin appears to us. But the word that describes penguin's looks should not be the same as how it appears to everyone.\nAlso, \"unique\" contradicts the \"ordinary\" definition which indicates that what is described is ordinary or normal.\nHence \"the same\" and \"unique\" are out.\nIn the same way, \"ordinary\" does not describe what the penguin looks like. To find if the \"ordinary\" fits, it should be put in the sentence with the \"it\" and \"waddles\" to get a sentence like \"What does an ordinary penguin looks like?\"\nIt might mean that the penguin is ordinary but that should not be the case.\nThus, \"ordinary\" can not describe the penguin's appearances.\nNow, as far as the remaining options are concerned, \n\"opposite\", \"the opposite\", and \"correct\" do not describe the penguins appearance either, \n since what a penguin is is not the opposite of what it looks like.", "answer": " 21"}

The question provides a number of details about Mitchell's study habits and asks for the total number of pages she read.\nStep 3: Formulate the strategy. By carefully analyzing the passage and taking note of certain numbers in the passage, we can deduce the correct answer to the given question.\n\n\nStep 4\uff1aConsider each option. As indicated in the passage, Mitchell reached chapter 11 in 4 hours of her study. Since it is said she took 4 hours to finish chapter 11, it can be understood that the number of pages in chapter 11 is equal to the duration of her study up to this point. Therefore, it is evident that she has spent 40 pages studying for chapter 11.\nAdditionally, after spending 4 hours on chapter 11, she continued reading for another 2 chapters. The total number of pages in the remaining 2 chapters is equal to the total duration in which Mitchell went beyond the number of pages she had read from chapter 11 previously. Therefore, the total number of pages after reading chapter 11 is 42 pages.\nCombining these two, we can understand that Mitchell has read a total of 42 pages after chapter 11, plus the 40 pages of chapter 11, which results in a total of 82 pages combined.

The total time spent by him to complete two cleanups in a day = 2 * 22 = 44 minutes.\n7 - Now if Richard has to spend a total of 700 minutes, he would have to clean two more rooms + one room he has already cleaned today. \n8 - Thus, we have to subtract 44 and add 2 *(1 + 2) or add 4 * 2, which gives the answer as 709.\nSo the final result is 709 minutes = 11.83 hours", "answer": " 136"}

From the choices given, we can deduce that the scientist is talking about bubbles with the child.\n2. The child is asking the scientist something about bubbles, it seems likely that the child is wondering how a bubble is formed, as there is a mention of liquid being able to create a bubble.\n3.

The question is asking how much would the discounted subscription be after 45% discout, if the normal price is $80.\n\nStep 3 : Consider each option.  Since the question is already asking about $80, it makes sense to subtract it from the total.\n\nNow, let\u2019s subtract $80 from Option 2, which reads, \"170 dollars\". So, we get 170-80, which reduces to 90. This is our answer.\nSo the final discounted subscription cost is 90$. This question can be taken from 'Common Data Interpretation Questions for bank exams'.\n\n### Solution:-\nIn the given math problem, we have to calculate the amount of the discounted subscription given a 45% subscription discount and a normal subscription price of $80. We will use the formula of Discount = (100% - Discount %) * Price. Now to figure out the amount of the discouted subscription, it is necessary to use the original subscription price of $8. Which in this problem is $80 because the formula would be applied to all the subscription. The $80 should also be reduced by the 45% discunt(100%-45%) to give us $44 or 0.5 of the discount. (45% discount is $44 which we will have to apply to the original subscription to get the discounted subscription price). Now the formula would be 1-0.5 $= $44 in place of $80. This means that 0.5 of $44(subscription price) will be added to $80 (or $44 - $80) giving us a new price of $124. The $124 is also reduced by the discount of (100%-124%)= 124-115=$9 or 115.09%. We'll add $1(which is one $1) of this discout to get the final price of $10 which is our answer.\n\n## Explanation\n### Explanation:\nThis instruction is asking us to identify what the man would want to purchase to increase his total of 4 items from", "answer": " 44"}

In three of the boxes, only two-thirds (2/3) of the crayons have been used. In one of the other boxes, only one-half (1/2) of the crayon boxes have been used. How many unopened boxes does Madeline have?\"\n2. Read the question carefully. The question is not about the number of unopened crayons but about the number of unused crayons. The key statement is \"only 5/8 of these boxes were not used\".\n3. Consider the boxes. For each box, crayons that have been used are 2/3 and crayons that have not been used are 3/8. 5/8 x 3/8 = 1/4. 4/5 x 1/2 = 2/5. Thus, Madeline has two-fifths of unused crayon boxes.

The total target mileage is 20 miles. If all the runs are completed, the total mileage would be 20\u00d73=60. Since Rosie didn't complete all of the runs, it must be added to her weekly target mileage. 4. Let's take Friday's run for an example, with assume that Rosie has to run for X minutes in addition to the total that she had previously run in the entire week. Since Rosie has already run for a total of 1 hour and 30 minutes, it means that on Friday, she has to run for Y minutes so that the total run is equal to 260 minutes (60+x). 5.

Choices: \n A: 1 in 5\n B: 2 in 5\n C: 1 in 4\n D: 2 in 6\n E: 3 in 6\nOutput: 1 in 6\n\nInstruction: 1. The given probability is \"1 in 6\" which means out of 6 trials, 1 of them will have an outcome of more than $40.\n\n2. We need 6 trials in the experiment because since the question is using 1 in 6, you can use 1/6.\n\n3. Considering the choices given, we can eliminate choices A and E, which are 1 in 5 and 3 in 6 respectively.\n\n4. This leaves us with three options: B, C, and D which can be further narrowed down to B and C.\n\n5. However, we can eliminate B because B is \"1 in 5\", and we know that 1/5 means one out of 5 trials. \n\n6. Hence, the answer \"1 in 6\", with the given number of trials given is C.", "answer": " 160"}

We know that 148 cubs were already born, so we know that the first population was either greater or lesser than 148. \nWe also know that cubs are born at a rate of 5 per 1 month, and lions die at a rate of 1 per 1 month. So, it makes sense that the question is asking about the population in month 1, 2, 3,..., 12. \nLet's consider each option:\n\nA: Lion cubs were born at the rate of one per every 5 months.\n\nWe don't know for how long the lions lived in the beginning. If it was greater than a year, it means that the lions die quicker when they are older, otherwise, faster when in their younger age. \nBut, if the cubs are born at one per every 5 moth, then they were only 147 cubs in month 2, since there weren't any of them born. But if we subtract from the same month in the beginning, then we would have 148. We also know that 1 cubs were born in month 3. Thus, lions were born at least 147 cub in month 1.\nThat's the only reason that this is not a possible answer.\n\nB: Lion cubs were not born at the rate of five per 5 months.\nThey were born at the rate one per five months.\n\nC: Lion cubs were at least 146 in number in month 1, and 146 in month 5.\nLet us start from month 1, they were born 1 cub in month 1, thus then 147 cub.

This information helps us understand the relationship between the piggy bank savnings and the repair expenses, which enables us to estimate the amount of money left in John's account.\n3. To calculate this value, we can use the following formula - ($25 * 24 months) - ($400 + $25 * 2 years) = $5360 - $420 = $1150.\n4. We have eliminated the rounding of the final answer to 1 dollar due to the possibility of decimal places being significant, which can result in either number being the possible answer.\n5. To check the reasonableness of our answer, we can assume that John's piggie-bank contains a $25 balance after withdrawing 2 dollars from it. We then replace the $1,150 in the calculation with $1148 as a worst-case scenario and the balance of the account is $7 which is not a valid amount.\n6. Hence, we can conclude that $1150 is the most likely value of John's piggly bank balance after spending 400 dollars on car repairs and withdrawing $25 every month for 24 months.\nSo the final result is $1150 dollars are left in John piggy-bank.\n\nInput:What is the most important thing that you will learn today at school?

We can analyze this question in two ways - Randy\u2019s expertise or Randy\u2019s practice time. \n\n3. Option (a) would take him 28 years to be an expert. This is because expertise implies that a person is adept in a field or subject which they have devoted a lot of time and effort into mastering. This doesn\u2019t seem true for Randy. Although Randy has been practicing piano for 12 years, he is not yet an \u2018expert\u2019. He has yet to perform concerts or make a big impact in the piano world.\n\n4. Option (b), if Randy were to practice for 16 hours a day (20 hours a day minus time for sleep/food/shower/etc.), it would take him 4.5 years to become an expert. However, 16 hours a is a lot of time and it\u2019s not feasible for Randy. Randy is a child and he also has other school responsibilities like homework, projects, extracurricular activities, and social duties. To add on top of that, Randy should sleep well and take meals in between his practice sessions. Moreover, the rule of thumb of 10,0x00 refers to mastery, not expertise.\n\n5. Option (c) would take him 0.093 seconds/month/year which is not a practical option. Additionally, it does not make sense to divide Randy\u2019s hours of practice equally each day considering that he can\u2019t be at the piano every day for the rest of his life. Instead, Randy would need some days off to regroup, which is not reflected in the option.\n\n6. Option (d) implies that Randy can\u2019t make any progress in his piano practice when he is on vacation, which also does not make sense. This would mean that Randy would have to practice an entire 2 weeks of 16 hours a days without any breaks or vacation-time, which is impossible.

{"idx": 227, "text": "1.The question states that there are 32 tables and 32 chairs in the hall. The question is asking for the total number of chairs in the hall, given the information provided.\n2.To calculate the answer, we can use some basic number theory. First, we can group the tables that have 4 chairs into one set, since they each have 4 chairs. This gives us 16 tables with 4 chairs each and 8 tables with 2 chairs each. Then, we can subtract these two sets from the total number of tables to find the number of tables with 1 chair each. This gives us 7 tables with 1 chair, and 2 tables remaining.\n3.There are a total of 3 chairs in each 3-chair table and 2 chairs in each 2-chair table. This means that each table has a total of 4 chairs in a hall with 32 tables. \n4.We know that each table has 3 chairs in it on average, so this means that the hall has a total of 32/3=10.67 chairs in it.\n5.The question also says that half the tables have 2 seats, which means there are 16 tables in total with 2 seats.\n6.There are a total 7 tables with 3 chairs, which means there are a total of 7*3=21 chairs in the hall that have 3 chairs at one table.\n7.Therefore the total number of chains is 10.67+16+21=57.07.\nSo the final amount of chairs in the room is 57.07 in total.\n\nInput: The bride and groom both asked the minister if the marriage was legal.

The question is designed to confuse the reader by introducing the term 'female horse'.\n2. It provides different options of'mare' and 'cow' which can both be referred to an equivalent of a female horse.\n3. The key to the question is to identify which of the two is correct, from a logical perspective.\n4. For the option'mare', one needs only think of the English language to be able to determine the correct term.\n5. In English, a horse is considered a male until it reaches the age of 4. An adjective describing a female horse before that time would be 'female', followed by a name for the gender used to identify the animal for the male gender (mare).\n6. Option D: 'cow' is also consistent with the above logic.\n7. A male cow is called a 'Bull', but the female term 'cow' is used exclusively for a female horse, implying that a'mare' is equivalent to a 'cow' in this context.\n8. Thus, the answer is D. 'Cow'.\nSo the final answers are D. Cow.\n\nInput:How do you fix a flat tire? Choices:  Tread it down A. B. C. D. E.\nOutput:1. How do you fix a flat?\n2.

When we can do that, we can begin solving the problem.\nSo the best start is to think how the given information can be related to figure out the height difference. \n\nFirst, let's assume that b = d+s.\n\nBy using our equation to substitute, we can eliminate either b or d at once. \n\nIf we chose b, let's try using d + x + d = b:\n\n- If d=0, it would imply x=80. \nIf x=80, we know that b cannot be 0, otherwise the formula would produce an invalid output because\n\n- a+a+b+b = b+b\n- 2a.\n\n- If d > 0, it would mean that the formula would imply d>d+x, which is impossible.\n\n3) The next step would be to combine some of the relations and eliminate x. \n\n4) Now, if Anne is 80 cm and her sister's height is 80 cm (we know that Anne is two times as tall as her sis, so it must be), the final output should not be 240.\n\nAfter checking, it's clear that we've reached the final answer, which is Anne is three times as tall as Bella's sister (80 cm), and the difference between Bella and this number is 240 cm.\n\nSo the final answer in this question is: Anne is 2 times more than her sister, who is 3 times the height of Bella, whose sister is 240cm.\n\nSo the finally answer is:  \nAnne is 2x more than her sister, Bella's sister is 3 times the same height as Anne, and Bella's sister's sister is 24cm.\n\nInput : What would you call a person whose favorite color is green and plays the harmonica?

Therefore, option D: \"licks\" is changed to \"licking\" to make it an equivalent to the other options.\n11. Hence, the answer would be the most logical choice of option D: licking. \nSo the final answer would be D: licking\n\nInput: The cowboy left the camp and headed across the plain on a lonesome horse riding fast.

{"idx": 304, "text": "1. The problem statement asks how much does Tommy spend on flour when he's making 12 loafs of bread, each requiring 4 pounds of fluff per loaf and using only the cheapest flour.\n2. Tommy will need to purchase 48 pounds of flour (12*4 pounds per loaf).\n3. He will also need an equal number of 12 loaf bags to contain both the flour and the bread, so 48 bags are needed total (12*4 loaves per bag).\n4. Since it states that Tommy can't use the leftover flour after making all 12 loaves, we can assume that 100 pounds of flour will be purchased (48*2 pounds per bag).\n5. The next step is to find the price per pound if Tommy is trying to save money on this purchase while still having enough flour for what's needed.\n6. Since 48 pounds of baking equipment costs $100, then 1 pound costs.02 dollars.\n7. But 100 pounds, or 2 bags, costs $136, so $136 divided by 12 (bags) equals $11.\n8. Therefore, Tommy would spend $11 for additional flour, so the total price would be $11+$136=$147.\n9. The total price is $147 because flour costs 2 cents per pound, but 12 bags are required (equal to 100 pounds).\n10. Hence, the answer Tommy got is $.12 per pound (2 cents).\nSo the final answer would be $.12 per pount", "answer": " 50"}

Calculate the numbers involved: In the question, Rick ordered a block that is 16 servings in size. That is, for each serving, you can eat a sixth of the block (since there are 16 servings). He has already had 5 servings, so he has already eaten a piece of the block that equals the whole of 5 of the 16 servings. That is 1/15 of the block or (1/15)(1/16)(1/16) and so on....

Options B and D have 'a living room' and 'a huge room', respectively. A bedroom is not an extension of either of these two living spaces. Eliminate options B and D.\n2.

We are given: \n    - Jay & Gloria (2 people) are hosting a party for 78 people. \n    - Jay invited 22 guests (about 30% of invited guests) & Gloria invited 35 guests (about 40% of invited guests). \n    - Jay's contribution is $14.30 and Gloria's contribution is $54.30. \n    - It is mentioned that they wanted to buy \"small\" flags for each guest, so it is assumed that $1= 1 small flag and 5 small flags for $1 each should be an acceptable assumption. \n3) Since this is a word problem, it is necessary to recognize that $ is currency and 1/5th of $ per flag should be an acceptable assumption and a small flag may be either 5 inches or one foot tall. \n4) Once the main information and assumptions have been recognized, we can begin the next step which is finding a solution. \n5) Step 1) For Jay's contribution, we need to find the 67th percentile (22/78) of 5 flags = 5*0.67 = 3.25 flags, or 1 flag + 2.25 flags.  This means Jay's contribution is 1 flag.  \n6) Step 2) Now that we know Jay's contribution, it is necessary to find Gloria's contribution. \n7) So, Gloria's contribution + Jay's contribution = 54.30 + 1 (1 flag) = $55.30.  This means Gloria would have to buy 4 extra flags: 4*5flags = $20.

We can understand Mark's playing field time: 25 minutes.\n2. Since there is a separate field time, we have to separate it from the other total game duration. Mark's sideline time will not contain the field time. So we want 90 - 25 = 65.\n3. 65 includes the sideline time + the field time. \n4. 65 - 20 = 45. Mark's sidline time = 45.\n5. This is how Mark's playing field, sideline and total game duration 90-minutes are different. \n6. Mark's playing field duration = 25-minutes. \n7.

Let's call these time intervals as t1, t2, and t3. The total time spent on reading for all 3 people is given as 4 minutes (2*x).\n5) Since they cannot finish more than 30 pages in a given time of 4 minutes, we know that the total time they spend will be less than 4.\n6) If we consider the time taken to finish reading a single page, then 30/x (minutes) means that at t1, 30 pages are being finished. Similarly for the other 2 times, we also know that at t2 and t3, 27 and (25 will also) be finished.\n7) Putting this together gives us a total of 30 pages that are finished at the first time t1.\n8) Similarly, 27 pages are finished at t2 and 25 pages are finished at t3.\n9) Subtotalling gives us, a total of 245 pages are finished out of 30 at 15 minutes.

If the number of books in the bookstore has decreased by 6, how many books of all three types are there in the store?\nOutput: \n1.Read and understand the question: In the question, the number of books decreased by 6.\n2. Now we have to find out the remaining number of books of all three types.\n3. Total = 20+40+35\n4. Number of novels = total/3\n5. In any case, decreasing by 6 is either subtracting one from numerator or one from denominator.\n6. Now, we can find it with 2 methods:\n7. 1.) Decreasing by 6 is subtracting 1 from numerator and then adding back 1.\n8. In this method, we have to divide 35+20 by 35 and the result is 66/15 = 4.33\n9. In this method, if the book was decreasing by 6, then 20(4.33 1/3) was the final output, 4.33 means 4.33 is the fraction, so it was multiplied by 3.\n10. The answer is 27 because 35+27 = 62\n11. The second method is like this:\n12. 20+45 = 45+20\n13. 45/2 = 22.5 and to the power of 20 = 27\n1", "answer": " 5"}

{"idx": 377, "text": "The first thing to notice is that there are four variables (let\u2019s call them x, y, z, and w) and four conditions (x < y, y < z, z > x, and z < w) in the statement. If we take this into account and apply logic, we can easily discard at least one condition each time because at most one of them can be true, giving us a reduced set of five. \n\n* If x < y, we know that \u2018y > x\u2019 can\u2019t be true because we need at least one condition to say \u2018y\u2019 is a different object than \u2018x\u2019. Since \u2018y\u2019 and \u2019x\u2019 are both variables, the only possible objects are Suraya and Caleb. If it\u2019s Caleb, then we would have to set x to 5 (Caleb\u2019s pick). Then y < z would also be true if z is greater than x. Hence, \u2018z > x\u2019 can't be true. So we would be left with just Suraya and Suraya being the only solution. Thus, this condition could never happen and must be eliminated.\n\n* If x > y, then y < z (at least) has to be true. Now for condition y < z to be true, \u2018z- y > 0\u2019 has to be true as well. If we assume that z > y, then y > z would be false. Since y < z, z < x should also be true. Hence this condition is eliminated too.\n\n* If z > x, then x < y is a possibility. Now we have z > x < y and x < y < z. From here, we can eliminate options where \u2018x < y\u2019. That is, y is either greater than or equal to x, or x is greater than or equal to y. Thus, we end up with only one possibility where \u2018x < y and y > z\u2019. This is not impossible at all since we know that Suraya picked at least one apple more than Caleb. So, the most we can get from Caleb is 6 apples (which is when x=5 and y=6). So Suraya\u2019s apple pick is at least 12, and Caleb\u2019s lowest pick is 6 apples.\n\n* In the original question, we know that x and y are Suraya and Cable respectively", "answer": " 7"}

{"idx": 383, "text": "The first step is to read and understand the question. The problem asks us to find out how long it will take David to clean all the windows in his house if he takes 10 minutes to clean 4 windows.\n\n1. Since we only know that it takes him 10 minutes to dust 4 windows, we can't determine how long it will take him to clean 64 windows without knowing how many windows he covers in one dusting.\n\n2. Since we don't have information on how 1 minute of work is divided among the four windows, we can' take this answer into consideration. For example, If each of the four window takes half-a-minute each to dust, then it will take David 24 minutes to clean one quarter of the windows. And if the four windows take a minute each to clean, it will take David 48 minutes to clean one quarter. In any case, if we let the fraction m represent the percentage of the windows that are cleaned in one hour, then the fraction of the windows cleaned in an hour will be equal to the number of hours needed to clean the remaining fraction of windows. So the fraction m (cleaned) of the windows in one hour will equal:\n= 1/0.04 = 25\nor \n= 0.5/0.04= 12.5\n\nThus, the answer is 12.5 minutes for this case.\n(Note: the fractional number of minutes cannot be divided by itself; If we want to find out how many hours it takes David with the given conditions, we can divide the answer by 24. In this case, it will take David around 59 minutes to clean the remaining fraction.)\n\n3. Let' time to dust all the windows of the house be T. If there are S windows in the house, we can represent every 4 windows as 2 fractions, x/64 and y/64 and every 10 minutes as k minutes. Then, The formula to calculate T is:\n  <math>  T = \\frac{1}{k*S}(x+\\frac{x}{t}+ 1/84+1/64+1/2048)  </math>\n\n(Taking into consideration that 4 windows is equivalent to 2 fractions: y/64", "answer": " 160"}
{"idx": 384, "text": "Step 3: What is the goal? What information do you need to solve the question? What is known already? \n1. The goal of the question is to determine how many cupcakes Anna has after she eats three and gives away four fifths.\n2. The information required to solve this question includes:\n3.   the total amount of cupcakes Anna baked, which is 60\n4.   the number of cupcakes Anna gave away, which is 4/5 to her classmates\n5.   the remaining number of cupcakes, which is 1/5\n6. Knowing all this information, we need to find out how many cupcakes there are left. \nStep 4: Read the question and find the keywords:\n7. The keyword here is 'left'. It is important to note that the question does not ask 'how many cupcakes were left?' but 'how many cupcates does she have left?' \n8.   We can conclude that the answer refers to the remaining cupcakes that are only Anna's to keep.\nStep 5: Analytical reasoning:\n9. To solve the question, you need to interpret it in the following way:\n10.   Given a total of 60 and 1/5 cupcakes left, find out how many cupcake is left for Anna.\n11.   When you take away 4/5 cupcakes from the total of 60, this leaves 1/5 cupcake. \n12.   This means that every 60th cupcake is Anna's to keep for herself. \n13.   So the answer is 12.\nStep 6: Answer the question:\n14. The final answer is 12 cupcakes.\nSo the final step is to calculate the answer using 60 remaining cupcakes and giving 4/5 to the classmates. This will give us 12 cupcaks left, so the answer is 1.\nSo the final count in this example of 60 divided by 9 (or 60 divided by the smallest number that can go into 60 and make it a whole number without fraction which is 9) is 6. This answers the question. Note that the number 5 cannot be an answer here because", "answer": " 9"}

{"idx": 433, "text": "Step 1: Read and understand the question. The question is seeking to determine how many people Tina has sold the books to by considering how much profit she made on sales of each book and the cost per book. \nStep 2: Know the context. Tina is selling books for $20 each and therefore making a profit. Each book is $5 to make and it is noted that each customer gets two books at a time. This indicates that each book is a pair. Therefore, a customer is not buying 2 books separately but is receiving 2 books as a pair for the same purchase.\nStep 3: Identify the mathematical expression. Each sale of a book earns a profit of $120. Therefore, 2 books are sold per customer at the same time. Thus, profit from 1 customer is $240 since each person gets 2 books per purchase. To get the number of book sales, divide the profit by the price of each book. This gives the number of sales as $50.\nStep 4: Analyze the options. The options include 'a) 20 b) 10 c) 40 d) 2 e) 4'. The options are calculated based on the following assumptions. A) Each person purchased 2 books. B) Each book costs $1 less than the selling price. C) Each customer buys two pairs. D) Each book is $1 more than the selling price and E) Each customer gets two books for the one purchase.\nStep 5: Analyze D) and E) in the context of the answer being the number of purchases. D) and E) assume that each person makes two purchases. Since each person is supposed to buy two pairs, the pairs should be the first purchase. If each purchase takes $20 and each books costs $5, then by the end of the first purchase, Tina would have taken in $400 in sales revenues and would have incurred cost of $100 (which is the cost to make 2 books). Since she has a net profit of $300, in order to make another $300 profit from people buying the pair for the first time, she would have to sell two more sets of books at $20 and lose a cost of $5. Therefore, Tina sells an additional $40 and gets to", "answer": " 4"}
{"idx": 434, "text": "1) We need to understand what the question is asking for. The question states that Michael made a certain sum of money selling his paintings.\n2) The question then asks what additional information is required for this calculation.\n3) Let's start by reviewing the different options that we could use to make a calculation.\ni) Subtraction: In mathematics, subtraction is the operation of removing objects from a collection. In the original problem, the question asks \"how much did he earn?\". Hence, subtracting the cost of the paintings from the total sales will lead to the answer.\nii) Division: In mathematics, division is the arithmetic operation that represents the fractional part of numbers. The question is asking for an amount of money, which is often represented in fractions that contain cents (eg. 75 cents). Hence, dividing the total sales by the prices of the paintings and rounding off the result, would give the desired result.\niii) Multiplication: In mathematics, multiplication is the arithmetic operation that signifies repeating addition of a number equal to the multiplicand with itself a specific number of times equal to the multiplier.\niv) Addition: In mathematics, addition is an arithmetic operation that represents combining quantities together.\nLet's look at each option to see if it will lead to the desired result. Consider multiplication and division:\n\nA) Multiply $100 and $80. We get $8000 which is not in the original question. We also aren't told if any of the paintings are free, so we can't calculate the profit margin in the question.\nB) Divide $800 by 13. We get 61 cents. The number does not satisfy the original conditions.\n\nLet's look to see if addition or subtraction will work. In this case, subtraction will lead to the final answer. If you take 5 multiplied by $100 and then subtract 8 from this, you get $760. If you take 8 multiplied by $80 and subtract 5 from this, you get a final answer of $700.\nSo option B: Subtraction is the right option for the calculation.", "answer": " 1140"}

{"idx": 436, "text": "1. The question asks how much money Maria must earn in order to buy the bike of her choice.\n2. In essence, we have to calculate the difference between the required and the provided amount along with the discount to figure out what Maria must earn in her job.\n   From the following information, we can determine that Maria needs to earn\n\n   $439.81 ($250+$600-$120) to buy the bike.\n3. At this point, it is important to consider Maria's options. Since she is only earning $250 through her mother, she will need to work at some other job to earn the rest.\n   This implies that she will have to work for a certain amount of days to earn the required money.\n   Additionally, since she is getting a discount of around $120, it means that her expenses will be less at the time of purchase and her job will have to earn $250-$120= $130.\n   Now, since she is earning $130, she'll need to work for a number of days equal to her expense (the discounted amount she needs to pay at purchase).\n     Her total earnings (on one job) can be calculated by multiplying the number of days she works by her $130 earnings per day.\n     For example, if she works for a week, she will need to earn $130*7=$910 to buy the bike with the discount.\n\n1. Thus, the final answer is that Maria should earn around $910 from her work to be able to buy a new bike with the discout she has.\nSo the final Answer is $910 (roughly $900.00).", "answer": " 230"}

For example, if we pick a random number from the range of 3 to 6 mm, it is a possibility that it is equal to or less than 26 mm.\n  7: To get the smallest value from X, it is important to eliminate the larger values for each individual day. \n  8: So, if on x1st day we find a value less than 26mm, we have to eliminate all values bigger than 26mm which is 3, 6, and 5 mm.\n  9: On the second day of rain, if we find a value lesser than the 26mm, again we have to eliminate the values bigger than 2xx which are 7.\n  10: Similarly, on the third day of rain, if find a value less than the 26 mm, the same rules apply and the other choices, which are 6 mm and 5 mm which are eliminated. \n\n9 So, the answer is that the Greg's family experienced less rain than the amount of rain experienced at Greg's house.\nSo the final (and correct) answer is \"Greg's family experienced less than the amount of rainfail which resulted from the same rainfall.\"\n\n### This Grade Math Practice Quiz Was Prep", "answer": " 12"}

{"idx": 449, "text": "1) Read and analyze the question carefully.\n2) Break down the questions into simpler questions. The questions \"How many marbles are there in jar A?\" and \"How many marbles does jar A have?\" could be asked separately. It is easier to identify the correct answer. It is not clear what is meant by \"12 fewer\" in the question.\n3) Identify the key points. We can identify that jar A has fewer marbles than jar B, jar A has 28 or fewer marbles, and jar B has at least 12 marbles.\n4) Build a simpler problem. We can first assume that jar A has a total of 12 marbles in it. Let's call the number of marbles in jar A n. We also need to use P(n) to show how P(A is empty) = n.\n5) Eliminate wrong choices. jar B has 12 fewer marbles than jar A, so that means the number of marbles should be less than \"jar A\" has fewer marbles than \"jar B\". So, the number of marbles is not 12.\n6) Calculate all the choices. We can put 12 as n, and solve for n. n = (P(n + 12) - P(12)) \u2248 0.08838 \u2248 9/10 * 12 * 3 = 108.

In order for the math to work out, 8 (legs of one spider) + 10 (members of other group of spiders), we need equal to or greater than, in this case greater than 18.

Choices: 1. uncomfortable 2. unhappy 3. distasteful 4. revulsive 5. distasteful\nOutput: 1st. Word should be the least common with regards to what feeling it describes. Disgust is closely related to the feeling of repulsion (noun) Disgust is the feeling of revulsion or distaste with regards to a particular thing or act. Distasteful, Revulsion, and Repulsion are all synonyms of disgust. Uncomfortable and Unhappy only come close when thinking of the situation where one gets drunk and vomits.\n1. Word should describe the feeling of discomfort and unhappiness, which is 2 and 3.\n2. Word should describe the 7th word from the right, which is 5.\n3. Distasteful and Revulsive are both words related to disgust, which is 4.\nSo the final word would be revulsive\n\nInput: What is different about a shoe lace and a shoelace? \n\nChoices: \nA) A shoe lace can be in a shoe, but a shoelace can't be in a shoe.\nB) A shoelace is often blue, but a shoe lace isn't always blue", "answer": " 112"}

Since the condition states that she might not be able to reach the 3050-gallon requirement if she drinks 3 gallons daily, we need to look for an amount that would exceed the requirement, and that is more than 3 gallons daily.\n3. There are no limits imposed on the number of gallons she would consume; hence, she could consume any number over the requirement.\n4. For this to be viable, she must exceed the 305-gallon mark. \n5. We can use the rule of logic here to find a number that is not divisible by 3.\n6. To apply this rule, we can list all the multiples of 3 that are greater than 3 (i.e. 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.) and check which of these numbers when multiplied by 5 can give us a result greater than 305.\n7. At this stage, we find out that only 24 cannot be achieved by just multiplying with 3.\n8.

The number of sick days available to an employee is defined to be 10 (assumption: Snowflake Plastic does not offer any more sick days for their employees during the year).\n3. The number of vacation days available to an employee in a year is assumed to be 10 which is also the number of vacation days used by Mark, the employee under question. \n4. The 8-hour long working day is set to be the standard working day for all employees at Snowflake Plasics. So, the question boils down to finding the number of days left that an employee has after using up half of the allotted sick and vacation days in a year. \n5. Let's take a look at all the given information;\n> 10 sick days = 0.1s\n> 10 vacation day = 0.1v\n> 5s + 5v = 10 + 0.1t\n6. Mark decides to use 15 days of all allotted sick days and vacation days available to him in a year, which is equal to half of the allotted days for him.\n7. Solving for t, we get\n0.1t = 0.5 \n8. Therefore, he has already used 7.5 sick days and vacation day on work.\nThus, he has 2 days left of allotted sick days and a total of 2 full vacation days left. In other words, an employee needs to work for 4 months in order to save up 2 days. This means an 8-hour workday is equivalent to about half a month.\nSo, the final answer is 5 months: 25 days.\nSo the answer is 5 months.\n\nInput:Why would the woman be carrying the lion?

(G is Gary's normal pay, GP is his pay when working overtime)   \nFirst, calculate the amount on his regular paycheck.   \nG(40 hours) = $480   \nG(Extra shifts) = $486   \nG(Normal payrate) = $12   \nTotal = $696   \n\nNext, figure out the total amount of GP he earned. I think you can already see the difference here.  \nGP(40 hours)  = GP(40 hours) + GP(40 hours + 1 extra shift) + GP(4 extra shifts) = GP*(3 hours/extra shift) + GP(7 extra shifts) \n\nGP = $480 + $282 + $445 = $20.70 * 1/3 + 10.76 * 1/4 \n    \nGP = $ 45.55 + 10.95\n    \nGP(40)  = $45.55   \nGP(Over 40) = $10.95    \n   \n$45.55 * 1.5 = $69.32   \nSo Gary worked a total of 45 extra hours during a week and earned $693.\n    \n    $696-(45*12) = $696-(540) = $ 156   \n    $ 156/ 10.9 = $14.3  \n    $ 14.3/60 = 0.2386 Rounded to 4th digit = 24 hours  \n    Gary worked 24 hours of overtime!\n\nInput: What kind of a room do you think is a master bedroom?

Some of the traits that I was focusing on were his age and profession but unfortunately we were interrupted before I could get to know about it. But here I believe that we need to determine whether the cause for interruption was due to the person on the phone or any other thing. Here I believe that there was someone on the phone. He is calling someone from the phone. I guess it was an emergency that led to this since we were interrupted without giving us a chance to talk.

We can see that the name of the best-selling and least-selling books are \"TOP\" and \"ABC\" respectively. There is no information on their title or author's name but this is not required for the question to be answered.\n3. The cost of the best-seller is $8 and that of the least-seller is $23. The unit of cost is shown on the left of the equal sign.\n4. Thirteen \"Top\" books and four \"abc\" books were sold lastweek. This part of information is mentioned above the equal sign.\n5. We will apply the equation in which total earnings = best-seller cost + total lesser-seller sales\n6. To apply this equation, first we need to figure out the total revenue earned from the sale of \"TOP\" books last week.\n\n1. Thirteen books of \"TOP\" were sold and each book costs $8.\n2. Thus, the total revenue earned on the sale of \"TOPT\" books last week = $8 x 13.\n7. Thus, the total earning from the sale is $104.\n8. Then, we add the total revenue earned, $104, to the cost of the \"TOP\" books, $8.\n9. Thus, the total cost of the 13 \"TOP\" books = $112.\n10. Now that we have found the cost for the best-selling books, we can plug it into the equation and apply it to answer the question.\n11. Total earnings (of sale of \"TOP\")= Best-seller's cost + Total lesser-seller's sales\n\n12. Thus, total earnings = $112 + 4 x $23\n13. Total earnings (in dollars) = $1316.\n14. Therefore, the cost difference is $316. Hence, the maximum earning in the store for all the best selling books is $316 more than the cost of the first least-selling book ($23).\n\nInput: A toy store sells 20 b", "answer": " 12"}

The first condition is that each attendee, in this case, Hally and her 49 friends, had to pay $150 to cover the cost of the party. It is clear that there was a total of $150 per visitor ($150 per person). If Hally and her friends organized the party, it should be in the capacity of $150 that they organized it or put up a $150 entrance fee as they had more visitors than the capacity they could afford with the funds they had.\n\nStep 3 : The last part of the question implies the total remaining funds which came to $50,000 after subtracting $5000. Let's take a look at this scenario:\n\nHally hosted a party with 51 people ($150 x 50). To cover the total bill, she collects a total of $7500 ($7600 - $100). This leaves her with $6800.\n\nStep 8 : The last condition is that there were 49 attendees at the party. How much money did they collect? Let's discuss the same thing with Hally. The total collected money is $4590 as we know that she had $100 contributed by 1 person when she hosted the party.\nStep 9 : The total collected money is subtracted from the total funds, to leave Hally with $50.00.\n\nThe last condition is that there was a total expense cost.

The question asks how many different types of fruits Jennifer has after she shares her pears with her sister. Each fruit has the same unit of measure. All the fruits mentioned are common, thus, they can be assumed to have the same unit of measure without further confusion. Thus, the question can be rephrased as how many times does she have to share to reach the number of each fruit she has left. \nStep 3: Calculate how many times she must share.\n1. We can assume that she has already shared both oranges and fruits left and it will be counted later.\n2. Given 20 pears, twice as many apples and 10 pears, we can find that the total number of pears left is 66. If she shares evenly then 66/(10+20) = pears she will be left with. \n3. To find out how many times she has to share, we can subtract 66 from the number of pears and oranges she shares with her sister.\n4. 66 + 6 = pears + oranges   pears + oranges = 72. \n5. pears + oranges - 66 = 72 - 66 = pears. She would have to share twice for a total of 36 times, each of a different fruit. \n6. So the final answer is 36.\nSo the final response is 36\n\nInput: If there are 35 employees in a workplace, and 8 departments are required for various tasks such as HR, accounting, customer service, and more.

The question asks about the kinds (not number) of rocks that make up one layer in the strata, i.e., the total number of 'rocks' of all kinds that make up a single layer.\n3. There are four types of non-rock materials: limestone, sandstone, quartz, and shale.\n4. Half of these materials are already covered by previous answers, i.e., 4/8 of this material is excluded.\n5. For each rock, there are multiple layers; e.g., there are 25 'rocks' (layers) in total, each with a different type of rock in them, e.g., limestone. So, the answer is based on 'rocks' (i.e., layers) with different materials (rocks, quartz, sandstone, shale) in them.\n6. Let's consider the three different kinds of rocks (excluding quartz) in layers.\n7. Quartz by itself makes up only 4 out of 25 layers (one-eighth).\n8. Hence, a single layer can have 4 different kinds of rocks (e.g., 1 quartz, 3 'rocks' other than quartz) or 2 rocks of the same type (i.e., 2 quartz together) or 1 'rock' with different 3 types (e.g., sandstone, quartz [quartz and sandstone], limestone).\n9. By this reasoning, the correct answer is 4 (1 quartz, 1 sandstone, 1 limestone, 1 shale) + 4 (1 quarts, 2 sandstone, 1 shale, 1 limestone).\n10. Hence, the total number of 'kinds' of rocks that are present in only one of the 25 layers is 24 (4 \u00d7 4 + 4 \u00d7 3 + 4 \u00d7 2). \nSo the final answer would be 24.", "answer": " 3"}

However, the batting cage selloff 3 dozen for $30. So, for 1 dozen, we get 3, hence, 3 * 3 dozen = $90.\n2. Dan buys 6 dozen and Gus buys 3 dozen - Taking note that Dan buys 5 dozens, and we know the cost is $30 per dozen, we can figure out the amount he has to pay - $140 + $10, and if he pays the total, then it amounts to $150, i.e. he pays 6 * $30. $600.\n3. Dan buys 7 dozen while Chris buys 56 golf balls - Again, given the fact that Chris buys 4 dozen,  we can find out that the total cost paid by Chris would be - 2 * $30 + 4 * $30 + $150 = $100 + $15 + $180 = $240.\n\nSo, by summing up the payments, we get a total amount paid of $900.\n\nSo the final answer would be D : $900.", "answer": " 132"}

Therefore, one choice per time period of each half-year needs to be chosen in order to represent the actual planting. 5) Using that logic, we can eliminate choices A to C because it's not possible to plant 3 trees in a day. 6) Choices D and E are more than one and less than three. It's also possible to do three trees at one time. Hence, the answer would lie somewhere in range of 601-649. 7) Choices A and B have similar time intervals between which they can be done, and in the same time period, A planting can be done up to 45 times more often as compared to B planting. 8) As a result, one can plant 1/45 of trees in one day as compared to only 1/54, that is choice B. 9) This means that we can eliminate choice A and option B.

{"idx": 553, "text": "1) Read the question carefully and identify the problem. To calculate how many cars can be park, first there is the requirement to assess how much area is usable for parking of cars in a parking lot of 400 feet X 500 feet in dimension.  2) To calculate how much area is useable for parring, you need to find the percentage that is useable for cars. Therefore, to obtain the value of 80% useable area, we need to multiply 80 by 100 so that we get the percentage of the 400x500 area which is usable for parging. For example, if 80% is the usable area, the usable area is 80/100 of the total area of 400x 500, which comes to 400/500 or 1/5 of the total area is usable for Parking.\n3) Once you have the usable area, you can determine how many cars can be put in that area by multiplying the parking units with the area. In your example, 10 feet is 10 units to park a car. So, how many cars can be parking in the useable area of 1/5 (400/2000) of the total area? This comes to 8, 10 times 80% or 500 times 10 square feet comes to an area of 5000 square feet or 400x1/5. As 400 is divisible by 7(400/7), if you need to do it by 5, do the calculation by rounding off to 20 so as to get the numbers of cars that will fit in the area of 50,000 square feet. You can get to know the number of square feet you can park by multiplying the number of square feet by 10 or 500 or 50.\nSo, the number of square feet in 400x400 square feet by 400 or 5,000 by 10 or in 400 or in 5,00,000.\n4) You can park 10 cars in one space which represents 15 feet.", "answer": " 16000"}

To answer this, we first need to convert the ratio of LN/AN into two fractions which can be done using long division.\n\n   LN / AN = (2/3) \\ 1 = (2/9)\n   \n   AN / LN = (12)/(10) = 12/10 = 11/10 \n     \n   Using multiplication property of numbers in fraction, this can be simplified as LN / AN = 2/9 \\ 11/11 = 2/12 = 1/6\n     \n   Thus, it can be shown that AN = (6)*10 = 60 pet dogs and cats\n     \n   LN = (13)*7 = 91 pet dogs and cats \n         \n   There are 44 pet dogs and cats that they have in common, meaning that AN + LN = 91 + 44 = 135 pet dogs and cats.\n      \n   The total number of the total pets the two have = AN + LN = (1)*9 + (1)*7 = 9 + 7 = 16\n5.

The number of leaves which fall in the first hour\n2. The rate of leaves falling for the second and third hour\n3. The average number of leaves which fall per hour\n\nThe number of leaves which fall during the first hour is 7. This is what we're going to call the \"known number.\"\n\nThe rate of leaves falling during the second and third hour is given as 4 per hour.

It is asking about three holes in a garage roof. \n2) The first part of the question states that when it's raining, the three holes leak water at different rates, and that the largest hole leaks at the rate of 3 ounce per minute. It also states that the medium-sized and smallest holes have a rate one-third and one-half of the rate of the largest respectively.\n3) In the second part, the question states that over a 2- hour period, the amount of water that leaks from the three holes will be calculated.\n4) This implies that the first step to answering this question would be to find the water leaked by the largest hole over 2 hours. After this, we multiply the amount of water leaked by this first hole by the rate specified by the original question, i.e. 3 ounces per minute. Then, we multiply this product by the second part of the question statement, i.e., 2 hours, to get the amount of water leaking from the large hole over 2 hours = 3 ounces x 2 hours = 6 ounces.\n5) Next, we find the water leaked from the medium-sized (middle-sized) hole over 2 hours by first multiplying the rate indicated (one-half of the large hole) by 2 hours = 0.5 x 2 = 1 ounce.\n6) And, finally, we find the water that leaks from small (smallest-sized) hole by multiplying the rate indicated by the original question (one-third of the large hole) x 2 hours = (one-third of 3) x 2 = 2 ounces.\n7) This implies that the total water that leaks from all the three holes over 2 hours = (6 ounces) + (2 ounces) + 1 ounce = 9 ounces or 0.24 liters.

{"idx": 590, "text": "1 The question states that 7 rectangular tables are used at a library and that the remaining tables are square ones.\n2 The question also states that a rectangular table can seat 10 pupils whereas a square table can seat just 4 pupils.\n3 So, if the library has 7 rectangles and 1 square table are enough to enable 90 students to read at the same time, how many more square tables can be added to allow 90 students to use the library simultaneously?\n4 At this point, the question might seem a little confusing, but it may be helpful to note that the first 7 rectangular tables have already been distributed as part of a plan. \n5 Adding that to the total number that the question states, we could say that the remaining tables after distribution would be equal to 1. (7 + 1 = 8)\n6 It can be assumed that the total number of tables available in the library would be 8.\n7 Now, to answer the question, we'll need to factor in the number of students that can be accommodated on each table.\n8 Based on the question, we can say that there are two ways that 90 pupil can be seated at a time:\n  9 When there are 10 students seated at a table, we will be able to accommodate 9 pupils, which will require us to divide 9 pupils in half (9/2 = 4.5).\n  10 However, if we do this, there will still be some extra students left over.\n  11 This is because 4.5 pupils cannot be accommodated on a 4-pupil table (4 \u00d7 4 = 16). So to even out the required number of tables (which have to be square ones), we only have to increase 4.5 students by 0.5 (4.5 +.5 = 5) since 5 pupils would perfectly fit on a 4-student table. \n  12 As a result, when dividing by 10, we would need 11 tables (9 \u00d7 10 + 10) so that all the students can be accommodated.\n  13 Therefore, the correct answer is E: 11 tables. \nSo the final answer will be E: 11tables\n\nInput:There is", "answer": " 5"}

If there are 18 novels in the contest, it suggests that each novel will take home $20 each. So, each novel will get $20 on first, each novel will get 2nd prize of $15 on second and each novel will get 3rd prize of $10. So 1st - 3rd place winners will take home $60 each.\n\n4: Fourth place will win only $20, hence it shows it's only first prize.\n\n5: Last year, first prize winner took home $200. That was 19% of what each novelist would take home. This suggests that every novel will win around the same %.\n\n6: Since we know that the percentage of last year's first place was 19%, that implies that every novel will take home $11. That clearly indicates that the pattern indicates there would be 19 novels and each will take home $10.\n\n7: So, the total will be $190. It leaves $110 with the publishing house who has already paid $800 i.e. ($800 - $190).\n\n8: Now it's time to deduct the money that each novelist will be getting. There are 18 novellists, who have already made $170 i.e. (190 - 20*3).

We need to understand the given condition: 'He takes a whole, uncutted pepperoni pizza...', which indicates that the pizza has not been cut yet.\n3.  The question also mentions that '... he cuts it in half'. This means that after cutting, the pizza is two halves.\n4.  Once he cuts it in halves, we can assume that he has divided each half into equal pieces.\n5.  Since we have already determined that each half was cut into equal pieces, we know that both halves have equal pieces.\n6.  He also cuts each piece in half to provide two smaller pieces.\n7.  With these considerations in mind, we need to understand that in total, there are six slices in the pizza, which is half of the 12 evenly spread slices.\n8.  After he takes the pizza, it would now be two whole halves, each of which has three equal pieces.\n9.  Lard picks one of these three pieces (one of the twelve slices), it now has two slices and 6 slices are left.\n10.  Once he gives the piece to Jelly, it will have two slices on it, of which one piece might fall off when Lard picks the piece up. This leaves two slices on the slice Lard is going to offer to Jelly.\n11.  Finally, 2 are left on the whole pepperoni pizza which will be shared by both Lard and Jelly.\n12.

After this their both the speeds increase as per the question. Note that brother worked at 2 times the speed at the previous time period.

{"idx": 626, "text": "19  \n\n1. The original question was, \"How many trash cans have the town paid for?\".\n2. We can simplify the questions even more to avoid confusion by rephrasing it as:\n\n    The town paid for adding 14 + 8 trash cans to their streets. \n3. To answer the question, we need to add up the number of trash cans the town paid for.\n4. Therefore, we can say that the town paid for adding '14 + 8' trash cans to its streets. \n5. Using the above, the answer would be 19  because 14 + 14 + 2 + 2 + 19 + 19 +1 = 19\nSo the final answer would be 14 + 6 + 10  = 19\n\nInput: If two people are in a house, which has three children, how many people are in it? Choices: A: one, six B: two,five C: three, four D: four, three E: five, two\nOutput: 147232295232483248 \n\n1. The question asks, \"If two people are in a household, which includes three children, how many are in it?\" (emphasis on 'which includes')\n2. We can break down the question into its parts:\n    \"If two people are...\"\n    \"In a house...\"\n    \"That has...\"\n    \"Which includes...\"\n3. The number of people in a house can be determined by counting the members of the family who are living in it. Therefore, we need to find out how many people are living in the household. \n4. The initial question implies that \"the household is not completely empty. There are two people living there, but there are also three children.\"\n5.  We can further simplify the question by rephrasing, \"There are six people in this household (two + three)....\"\n6. Now, we can use basic Arithmetic to get the answer:  2 + 3 + 453524525245 = 75324524524\n7. Using the above, we can say that \"the answer should be", "answer": " 42"}
{"idx": 627, "text": "Step 0: Read and analyze the problem. We begin the problem by setting up some equations that can be used to calculate the time left to finish the exam. We want to find out how many minutes will be spent on the exam if Jessica is currently on question 16 of the exam which is out of 80 problems. \n\nStep1: Determine any given quantities. Since Jessica has answered 16 questions out of 80 total, we can use those numbers to set up our equation.\n\nStep2: Decide how to represent the unknown value. We represent the time left to finish as x. So the expression becomes t = 1(80 - 16 )x.\n\nStep3: Identify the constraints. A basic equation is t = x. We will break this up in two ways. The first is x = t. The second is x = t - 12 since we know that Jessica has used 12 of what was originally 1h.\n\nStep 3a: Determine the restrictions. We cannot solve the equation x = t (1h) because there is a negative sign and we also know that we only have 1h to give the exam. \n\nStep4: Solve for the unknown value in all possible ways.\n\nStep4a: Use the x-value equation.\n\nLet's begin with solving t = x using the equation x=t so that x=1(80-16). x would then change to 1(64-16)=70.\n\nStep 1: Substitute one variable for another. One of the options is replacing the unknown value t with, let us take x.\nStep 2: Identify any key steps in the substitution process. \nStep 3: Determine how to represent the new value. The new value is found as x= t = 70 so that x=70. Therefore our expression becomes 70 = 1(8+16)=77. We now want to solve for x using the new equation, t = x. so that x=t. x = 70 and t = x; therefore we are left with 70 = 2(35), or x = 2(38-16).\n\nStep 4a: Use the -value equation.", "answer": " 0"}

The first portion of the question contains a number, $45, and the unit, \"hours.\" $45 is earned for 3 hours of work, but if the rate were $45/hour, we would still only have 3 hours as our earned amount.

The remaining portion of the question includes a number, $75, and the rate, \"$45 for 3 hrs.\" If the rate is \"$45 for 8 hours\", then 1 hour of work is \"$45.\"\n3.) 3 hours of work costs $45, and in this case, work = time. That means that $45 can be spent in 3 hours. \n\n4.) If the baby-sitting rate is \"$45/3 hrs,\" then one hour of baby-sitting costs $45/3 = $15 (1 half hour = 30 min.).\n5.) The baby-sitting rate of $15/hr would mean that a 1-hour baby-sitting gig pays $15. A 2-hour baby-siting gig pays $30, and so on.\n6.) If the baby-sipping rate were $13.50/hr, and an 8-hour day pays $13.5/hr, then 3 hours pays $\\left(13.5/8\\right)*3 = $9.75$.\n7.) The rates would vary for different jobs and babysitters.\n8.)

He might be happy one moment, but become sad later in the day.\n   B (Always cheerful): does not correctly describe Mikael either. We are unable to describe Mikael as 'cheerful' all the time because that suggests that he constantly exudes or demonstrates positive feelings throughout the day.

The statement includes 3 variables: $950, \u20ac920, and 6%. From the given options, we will be able to identify which combination is correct.\n3. Let us start from one condition then move ahead to another\nA1. Let A= $950. Firstly, we know that \u201c950\u201d is not negative\nA1. Since $950 is not negative, we can substitute \u20ac920 for A. Since \u201c920\u201d is positive, 6% will provide us with a greater discount (ie. \u20ac5.68). Therefore, \u20ac5.68 will be a greater saving at second store.\nA1. Now that A1 is identified, we can go to the next condition which asks \u201cWhich store will provide a greater savings?\u201d in the case that 1) one store is offering a 6% discout while the other is offering a 5% discout, then store (A1) will be the winning store as 6% > 5%. \nA.

Therefore, we must convert the answers for the hamster to some more suitable animal, such as the dog. \n\nThe hamster dies in 2.5 hours, but we care about the longelevity of time. Therefore, we must calculate the longevity of time. To do this, we multiply the number of hours by 24.\n\nHence, the hamster's longevity in days is: 2.5 hours x 24 days = 60 hours = 2.5 days = 2.5 hours. \n\nNow that we have the hamster's time in days, we can apply the formula (4) to compare the longevity of a hamster to a dog. Given that there are 365 days in a year, we find out that the average longevity of a human in years = 365/2.5 = 143, with standard deviation of 10 years, with a 95% confidence level.\n\n\nHence, we can conclude that a dog will live on average 113 years.\nTherefore, the answer is C: 113 years", "answer": " 12"}

The second instruction involved Bill's wife Jilli taking 10 apples and then baking two pies, leaving a total quantity of 60 apples to be divided among the remaining three, including the additional child.\n6. The final instruction involved each of the three adults/relatives baking two pies with the given quantity of 60, which means that Bill could now pick up to 5410 apples for next year's harvest.\n7.

Determine the rate at which Grace reads books, which in the question has been stated as 20 pages per hour. We need to remember that this is the rate at which she reads, not the rate at which she finishes the book.\n\n3. Applying the information above, we can find that Grace takes 20 hours to read 200 pages which implies that Grace reads 10 pages per hour, hence, 100 pages in 10 hours. We can write this as: 200 pages / 20 hours = 10 pages / 1 hour. Note that we have already converted the book's pages to units of 1 book. \n\n4. This gives us: 20 hours = x pages / 10 hours.

Go through the options one by one, in increasing order of complexity, to find the answer. \n\n5th step: Identify '1 candle each' as the key phrase in the question. \n\n6th step: Identify the number of candles that Stephanie has in total '30' and the number of cupcakes to be decorated '24'.\n\n7th step: Add 1 '1 candle each = 1 candle each + 1 candle each = [2*1] candles for half of the cupcates (24 cupcakes)'.\n\n8th step: Adding the total '30' number of candles that she has in total and the '2*1' candles for the half of the cupcate, we get the correct answer '30 + 2 * 1 = 32 candles' as Stephanie needs additional '2' candles for the cupcates to be complete.\n\nSo the final answer would be A: 32 candles.\n\nInput: \u2586How much time did a person take?

{"idx": 691, "text": "1) The question was to determine how many bottles of wine would remain in his cellar after a party in the cellar. 2) We know that Joses cellar contains 2400 imported bottles of wine and 1200 domestic bottles of wine. 3) The guests drink up 1/3 of the imported wine. So we know that the guests drank 800 bottles of wine. We also know that no guests drank imported bottles as they only drank imported wine. 4) Since there were half as many imported bottles as non imported bottles at the start of the party, it means that the imported bottles were consumed at a ratio of 1:2. Since each bottle contains 750 ml of wine, we can understand that only 300 imported bottles were lost. 5) The same logic can be used for domestic bottles. We know that the guests dug up 1/3 bottles of domestic wine and that they dug domestic wine bottles at a ratio of 2:3 (this means that one imported bottles gave way to 2 domestic bottles ). since each domestic bottle contained 750 mL, we can understand that the guests digested only 400 domestic bottles. 6) Therefore, we can determine that Joses cellar will contain all the imported bottles of wine, which is 2400 and half of the domestic bottles of wine, or 1200 in total. 7) The result is a total of 3600 bottles of domestic and imported wine. 8) Therefore, Jose will have only 3600 leftover, which is the correct answer.

The first step is to understand the context and determine that Tokyo, Japan is the start and that Nara, Japan is the endpoint, indicating that the journey is taking place entirely within different locations of Japan. 3. The question further suggests that Tokyo is a start and not an endpoint indicating that Nara is not part of Tokyo. 4. We can eliminate options A (by foot) and C (by boat) on this basis as they involve a different mode of travel. 5. We can now consider the remaining options that indicate travel in Japan: F (train), B (bus), and D (airplane) 6. The choice that involves traveling by airplane is D and we can eliminate it on the basis that it is more time-consuming and it also involves the movement of another mode of transport - the airplane, that is more complicated than simply using another mode of transport. 7. The remaining options for airplane and bus involve the movement of other methods of transport, which adds further complexity. 8. Furthermore, airplanes are generally faster than buses because they can cover greater distances faster. 9. This leaves us with B (bus), which is the fastest way of traveling from Tokyo to Nara by bus. It is further confirmed by looking at the distances of Tokyo and Nara - the distance between the two locations is approximately 800 kilometres 10. If we", "answer": " 8"}

In this case, it can be simply expressed as profit=$6-($1+3*25),which gives us a profit of $21.\nStep 2: Eliminate operations: Now that we know the operations required, we can eliminate the operations that are not required. We can first eliminate the cost of string: $1 because that was the fixed cost incurred once and not a cost that changes with the sale of bracelets. The value of the string was fixed and it won't impact the profit. Similarly, the cost of beads or the value of materials is the same for each bracelet, so $3 was fixed.\nStep 3: Eliminate operations that are impractical. Here, it is impractical sell for a total of $1-($3*25) as a bracelet with a negative value is impossible. Therefore, the only answer option to this question remains $21.\nSo the final result is $21.\n\nInput: The new school had a swings set but no slides.

We know that Harry joins a marathon.\nSince the question is talking about a certain week, we are trying to understand what happened each day of the week.\nStep 2: Collect information and write down the important details.\nStep 3: Identify the key terms. We need to determine what variables we can identify within the question. Some terms which are very basic in this question are:\n* Time\n* Speed\nStep 4: Define rules and identify units of measurement. We know that he has to run at different velocities at different times within the day.\nFor example he ran 10 meters faster per hour on Monday than he ran Tuesday to Thurday and he then ran 60% of Thursday on Friday. \nStep 5: Eliminate the outliers. In this specific scenario, the most basic part can be eliminated. It is true that Harry is running at 10 meters per \n\nhour on Monday but we can eliminate it as a rule because running 10 meters for an hour is quite meaningless. We are actually concerned about the velocity, not the 10 meters per\n \n hour. We eliminate other irrelevant terms. We see that he ran at a faster speed than what he ran on Monday. The units of speed at which he ran cannot be measured because he ran \n\n at different \nvelocities but we know it should be at least 50% faster or else it's not feasible for him to run at a better time and place. \nStep 6: Finding the simplest solution. After applying the rules (and eliminating) we find that on Monday, Tuesday to Thru'day he ran with the speed of 5 which means he \n ran at 30 meters per hour. On Friday, he finally ran at the speed of 4 which means he ran at 60 meters per hour. Since the units do not have to add up it is possible we should be dealing with the speed of the \n running but not the distance.\nTo calculate the answer without using variables, we can say that in one hour he'll run at 60mph.\n(5*0.5 )+ (4*0.5)=120 meters per hour\nSo the", "answer": " 24"}

This means that of the three governors, Govenor Saundoval (1) and Governor Sloan(3) gave more than twice the number of addresses as compared to Governor Saundoval (2) (12-10 = 2). Therefore, Saundoval (1/2) + Sloan(3) must be less than or equal to the total number of addresses given. \n\n5) Since Governor Sandoval (1/2)*2 + Governor Sloan (3) = 30, we can see that the total number of addresses must be between 30 and 36. This indicates that the possible answer is between 30 and any number greater than it. This eliminates the options of 32 and 36 (excluded as possible answers). \n\n6) Since the total number of addresses is between 30 to 36, the total number of addresses cannot be greater than 30, which makes A, B, C, D, and E as incorrect options. \n\n7) The total number of addresses could be between 30-31 (30+7), so the answer has to be 30+7.\nThus the answer of this question is 30+7=37.

The question provides us with some important information, including dimensions of a triangle for both Zion and his friends, which are all important as far as the area of the triangles are concerned.\n3. There are three triangular houses made by Zion and his 2 friends.\n4. Using Pythagoras theorem it is possible to determine the dimensions of these three triangles since we know the lengths of 2 of the sides (40 cm and 20 cm) and the height (20 cm).\n5. So by applying pythagoras theorem we can quickly determine the dimensions of each of these 3 triangles:\n\n   For a - 50 cm x 20 cm and b - 30 cm x 24 cm\n   \n   For c  - 50 cm\n6. Since we know the dimensions of these triangles, it is trivial to find their areas, which can be done in the following way: for triangle A: 1/2 x 50 cm x (height 20 cm) = 100 cm2\n\n   For triangle B: 1/2x30cmx(height 24 cm) = 360 cm2\n\nSo the total area of all three triangles is 460 cm2 (sum 100 + 360)\n7. The sum of the areas of the triangles built by Zion and his friends would be found by adding the areas of all three triangles, thus the area of the houses would be 460 cm.\n8.

Understanding the different ways we can work on this. We can try to calculate Alex's \"weekly income\" first and then his remaining 25%. We can also solve for his \"weekly income\" after multiplying the \"25%\" by his \"water bill\".\n3. We can't apply logic to the \"tax\" or \"tithe\" since they are functions of the other values.

In the last step, we can multiply the water bill by 0.25 or work the logic of 10% tax in other ways to get to the final answer. \n6. We'll solve for \"weekly income\" and multiply it by 0.2.

First, we need to make sure the variables are understood and that they can be used to answer the question.\n3. Then, we need to use some logic to eliminate the variables that have the same units and are not needed for the answer to be a mathematical answer.\n4. First of all, since the question refers to floats in the parade, it's reasonable to assume that the candy thrown is distributed evenly at each float. \n5. We also know that there are four floats in the paraade.\n6. So, the number of candies thrown = total number of candies in total.\n7. With this knowledge, we can immediately eliminate one of the variables as we know that the number of candies caught is not important to answer the question. \n8. Further, we can also eliminate the variable of one of the friends' total candy count, as it has no importance for the answer.\n9. So, the three remaining variables that will be used to answer the given question are: total pieces of candy caught, total pieces of candy thrown and total pieces of candy distributed.\n10. So, the question is then, how many pieces of candy were distributed?\n11. We can assume that the number is distributed equally to the four floats in the Christmas parade.\n12. Therefore, the question can be answered from the remaining three variables:\n\n  total candy thrown = 4 * total candy caught\n\nSo, we need to use one of the variables and plug it in the equation above, to calculate the total number of candy.\n\n  total pieces of candy = 4 * (number of candies caught)\n\n13. Since 22 + 13 + half the amount of candies Tabitha caught + 2 * (number of candys caught by Carlos) = 4 * (total candies caught), we can plug in known values in the equation to solve it:\n\n  22 + 1 + half of 22 + 2 * 13 = 4 * n\n\n 23 + 1 = 4 * 24\n\n 40 = 4 * n.\n\n 28 = n.\n  \nAfter", "answer": " 72"}

{"idx": 839, "text": "1. The question is worded as a riddle, which typically implies that there is one right answer.\n2.

All dogs made it to shore how many animals made it to shore?\"\n3. Let' number of animals be represented as n.\n4. The question gives n, the total number of animals\n5. The question tells us that from 20 sheep, we have 3 drowned and 17 remaining. We can rewrite this as 3 + 17 = 20. This means we have 3 extra sheep in the other part of the boat or 20 - 3 = n, where n = 20 - 4. This tells us that there are n + 20 - 2 = 22 animals apart from the 3 that drowned.\n6. The question states that 10 cows drowned. By adding 10 to 3, we know that the number we should add is 13. This means the amount of extra cows we know of is 13 and the number of sheep is 10 + 13 = 23. That's equal to 23 left + 17 original = 40 animals. We can take 40 - 3 = 37 which is to subtract the number of drowned sheep. This confirms that the total number of animals we have is n + 20 + 13 + (23 -3) = 66. It is equal to n + 20. Our n is n = 17.\n7. We know that cows drowned twice the number of times as the sheep which means the original number of cows is 10 + n*3 = 10 + 51 = 61.\n8. The dogs didn't drown. So, there are 66 + (17 - 3) = 86 dogs total. So, the answer is n + 23 + 86 = 195 animals total.\n\nSo the final answer and hence the boat is sinking is 195 animals.", "answer": " 35"}

You have to infer to the question that the answer is within the area where your friends are hiding, unless specified otherwise.  3) the choices C (in the attic), E (in a secret place) and D (on a hill) cannot be found within a building and are, therefore, ineligible.  4) The choice of location depends on what is most suited to hide. One of the most suitable areas to hide would be in a secret place of which you have complete control over.  5) The choice 'a' can be eliminated as it is not possible for humans to be under water for hide and seek.\n6) The answer should be 'e' because the given location is indoors and as such, it makes more sense to search for your friends within the building.

The question given is an algebraic word problem in math, so it requires us to carefully read and comprehend the given information before proceeding to solve it.

Eliminate irrelevant options. \n\n   At first glance, we see \"on a farm\" and this is what we are dealing with, so the word \"farm\" is not relevant here. \n\nStep\n\nStep 4.

Formulate a logical argument that is relevant to the question. \n\n   \"Total production of the farm for 5 weeks is 5 times or 2160 totalled to 2160\"\n\n   \"Every 6 cows produces the total, it's divided by 6 and it produces 2160 for the duration in weeks\"\n\n   \"So the average number of cows would be total production divided between number of cows and it is 2160/6 cows it is 152 cakes\"\n\nStep\n\nSo the final answer has to be 152 cats as it is the answer.\n\nInput: 3421 is 2^5+1.

The hot air balloon has a total of 200 baloons, which means there are 2 balloons per square meter. That makes the dimensions of the balloon 2m x 2m.\n2. After about 30min of blowing up the balloons, 1/5 = 88 of the whole number of 200 have blown up. As you can see, this is still 122 balloons.\n3. After another 2 hours, the amount of blown up balloons doubles so 88 + 88 = 176 balloons are blown up.\nBased on this we can now answer:\nAfter about 2 hours and 30 minutes of blowing up 1/5 =122 of the total 200 baloonos in the air balloon.\nHow many baloons remain intact?\nSo the final answer should be 200-35 =235\n\nInput: Which is more expensive to operate a car or a motorcycle?

The question proceeds to ask if choosing 'Yes' or 'No' would be the correct option here.\n3. Therefore by process of elimination, we can conclude that 'Yes' is the correct answer.\n4. By analysing these two statements, we can reason that these statements have no logical relationship. It is not clear how Victoria's father having three children indicates whether he is likely to be wealthier than her grandfather, and 'Yes' does not clearly state that he will be.\n5.

These symbols, called variables, may represent quantities without a known value (such as a person's weight) or quantities that can vary (such as time or temperature), which can be solved for when given specific conditions (the time spent in a country or the height of a tree). Algebra includes operations such as the application of equality to variables (such as 4x = 12), the definition of relationships among quantities (such as a = 3), and the construction of equations from variables and properties or relationships of said variables (such as x \u2014 3 = 5). Algebra has been called the language of mathematics; many mathematical concepts can be expressed more concisely using algebraic symbols than in words. In turn, algebra is often a prerequisite to advanced studies in certain fields such as chemistry, computer science, and electrical engineering.\n\n## Scope\n\nAlgebra provides a systematic and generalized way to write custom rules which can easily be applied to numbers and variables.\nAlgebra includes the following topics:\n\n* Basic operations with numbers\n* Variable and variable expressions\n* Equations, inequalities and expressions\n* Properties of numbers\n* Simple and compound equations\n* Factorization and division\n* Polynomials and factorization\n* Quadratic equations\n* Fractions, percentages, ratios and others\n\n## History\n\nMathematical operations and quantities were used to create algebra as early as 2000 BC, but many of the ideas that we consider basic to algebra did not begin to appear as a discrete science until the later Greek and Hellenic era.

Let's solve this by first computing Mike's number of chocolatet squares without any help. The question states that Jenny has a tummyache so this can be deduced that Jenny and Mike are of the same age.\n3. So the total number of chocolate squares eaten by Mike should be greater than Jenny's. But Mike's number of squares should not be greater than Jenny's number of squares because she also has a tummy ake.\n4. So Mike ate less than 5x Jenny's number of squares.\n5. To solve for the number of squares Jenny ate, then \"Jenny ate 5 morethan three times the...number of chocolate squares\". We get that Jenny ate \" 5*3 = 16 + twice the x + 2 = 32\" number of squares. \n6.

A flagpole is supported by two pieces of wood at the top and bottom of the flagpole. The bottom support is 3 feet tall and the top support is 4 feet. This means that total 6 of the 12 feet are supported by the pole on either the top or bottom support.\n3. We know that the part which was the tip breaks off into a dangle that is 2 feet long. This means that the rest of the 12 foot flagpole has 10 feet that it is supported by on both the top and bottom supports.\n4. Therefore, we can say that 4/6 of what was the flagpole is now supported by the pole and dangle, which is 2/3 of the flagpole.\n5. Using this information, we can write an equation: {10 \u2013 6} (3 ft) = 2, which can be simplified to 4 (10-6) = 2 or, 40 = 2 which gives us 20.\n6. The part which was the tip of the pole now dangles 20 feet from the bottom of the pole which is 20 feet up.\n7.

Javier is a javelin thrower and he has thrown a javelin, but we don't know the amount of time it took him to throw the javelin. So based on all the information given in the previous choices, Javier has already thrown a javelin and the story has asked us to calculate how far it is thrown.\n\nStep 1 :Based on this question and based on the answer choices given in the previous question, I would start by looking at the choices carefully. This answer choices are: 0, 50, 75, 225, and 25. The question asks us to choose the right answer that is \"how far, in meters,...\", and this is where we should look for a \"me\" word that could easily represent the \"Javier\". If I would use another example it would be \"How far is John in meters?\". Based off of this question, we can conclude that a number in the middle is the answer to our question. The choices given to us are 50, 125, and 175.\n\nStep 7:Now we should check out the given answer choices given to us. The answer A 50 meters has 50 in it. However, we cannot have 50/3 to make the numbers add up correctly with the rest of the question. Therefore, answer choice B, with 75 meters, is not a correct choice. The answer choice C with 125 is a valid number to add up with the rest of the story, except the fact that on his second throw he only threw the javelin half as far as he did his first. This means his javelin went 125 times farther which is 125 meters, but the question already states that he threw it 1050 times farther. The answer choice E is also valid because it has 175 meters in it which sums everything up.\n\nSo the answer is C:125 meters.\nInput: I need to buy a gift for a person.

The question seems to ask about spellings of words; a day must pass before any repetition of the spelling of a word can be observed.\n3.) Identify the correct option. Certainty (A) is not the right option as the statement has not been expressed as a question.  It may be possible to spell the same word again; it just wouldn't be identical.  Also, the letters used to spell a specific word could be used in a multitude of other words.  It may be a possibility that no two words (even of different lengths and words, even if they were the same spelling) can be used in the same way using the same letters.  (A) is therefore rejected as the answer to the question of can a specific word be spelled without repeating any of the letters.\n\n4.)

How many of the pallets were paper plates? => \"a fifth\"  \nQ5. and how many were paper cups? => \"the rest\"\n2) Since Q5 does not include the percentage or fraction, we need to convert it to a percentage first so that the problem would be consistent with the context. To do this, we take the fraction part with integer value and the fractional part away, which is (1-1/5). So the answer for Q5 would be 20 / 5\n3) So, since the store received 20/5 pallets of paper cupples, then all the pallets should be paper cups.\n4) Since it states that half the pallets are paper towels, then 1/2 * 20/5 gives us back 10. That is the number of pallet of paper towels the store received.\n5) Similarly, since it states that a quarter the pallets are tissues, then 1/4 * 20/4 gives us back 5.

From the given price list, we can infer that Betty is going to buy 100 units of ice cream because:\n6. This means she would have to spend $500 on ice creams.\n7. It can also be concluded from the choice of options that there is a limited budget of $2000.\n8. We can then write an equation to calculate how many drinks, cakes and ice creams she can buy for that budget.\n9. Let's start by writing the equation for drinks. According to the problem, she plans to buy 10 drinks. Substituting the value of 10 in the unit price, we find the number of drinks she can buy for that value of money.\n10. Now that we have written it as a mathematical symbol, the expenditure on the drinks now becomes:\n13. Thus, she can buy drinks for a total of $200.\n14.

The steps are arranged as 20 x y = z where 20, y, and z are the actual answers.\n3) Next step is to understand the logic and solve the problem statement based on the provided statements.\n\n4) Step 4: Firstly, note that 20/2 = 5 and the total number of people invite with one more person is 10. Thus there will be 20 +2 x 10 people in the party including Ashley. Here the given answer should be 20 + 5 + 10 + 2 +1 = 47\n\n5) Step 5: Here, 20 x y will be the actual numbers of the guests and the party. So, we have 20, y and the total number of guests.\n6) Step 6: We must find y so that 20 x y > z or 20 x (x +1) > z\n7) Sum(47 - x) = sum_(y=0, 1, 2,...., z - 1)\n8) The statement gives the answer as 20, so 47 = 20, now we need to get y.\n\n9) So, 20 = 20 x y, we need to get y to make the both sides of above equation equal.\n\n10) So the above equation is: y = 20 / 20\n\nStep 11: Again applying the above equation, we get y = 10\n\n12) So the answer for the number of guests attained by the party is:\n   y = 10 and we know that the invite of each invited guests is 2 y= 10 and 40 invited guests", "answer": " 31"}

The question asks for the number of apples that were bought by two men and three women if the two men bought 30 appes each, 20 less that the number of apples each woman bought in that same shop.\n2. The key concept to understand in this question is that the two men purchased 60 apples each and the three women purchased 30 apples each. \n3. This is evident from the statement, \"each man bought 30 appples, 20 less the number apples each woman bought.\"\n4. We can then use this information to work out the answer because each man would need to buy 30 less apples than each woman in order for each man to buy the same number of apples in total as each woman. In this scenario, this would translate to two men needing to buy 60 - 30 = 30 apples or 5 apples apiece.\n5. Then,  the total number of apples purchased by each man and each woman would be 30 + 30 = 60 apples. \n6. Therefore the correct answer to this question is 60. We can make this conclusion by working out the total number of appeles bought by two men and women by multiplying 5 by 3:\n\n  60 apples for each man + 60 apples for women =  60 apples\n\n7. Hence, we can conclude that there were 60 apples bought in total.\nSo the final answe is 60\n\nInput: When should you not do something?

The second staircase had twice as many steps as that of the first one\nc. The third staircase had 10 fewer steps as compared to the second one\nd. Each step was 0.5 feet high.\n\nTo find an answer, we need to know how to convert steps to feet and how to calculate the total distance in feet.\n\nLet's approach the problem by calculating the total steps and multiplying the total steps by the average height of each step.\n\nAs per the question, John climbs up 3 staircases and each stair case has 20, 40 (twice the height of first staircase), and 50 steps.\n\nHence, the total number of steps equals to 3 * 20 + 2 * 40 + 1*50 = 140 + 80 + 50 = 270.\n\nMultiplying total steps (270) by the height (0.5 feet) gives us total distance (135).\n\nTherefore, the answer is B. (The original question asked for how many 'feet' and 135 feet is the correct answer.)\n\nSo the final answer in this case is A. (Hence the question asked about the distance and in this case it is B.)\n\nThe second question is a little trickier. \n\nWe first need to realize that in problem solving, we should always look out for patterns. \n\nWhen we do, we notice that problem 6 is the same as problem 5.

Now, we can assume that M and N have received the same number of turtles at the end of the event, meaning that the difference of 2 turtles they had at the start has been evenly divided between them, with each of them receiving half of that difference.\n4. Therefore, if M started with 2 more turtle than N, then N will receive 2/5 of the difference (towards the end of the event), or 2/10 of the total amount of turtles.\n5. Applying the same logic to M's situation,M should receive (20-40)/5 = 7/5 turtles from the event, bringing it to 20 turtle + 7/5 to 27 turtles.\n6. Thus we can conclude that N and M received 27 turtle each.\nSo the final Answer is N and M received 54 turtles.\n\n\nInput: If I am driving, then what am I operating?

Let X be the monthly cost of wooden statues. \n6. Then 10 stone statue cost $20 and X stone statue cost $2X.\n7. Therefore 30 wooden (X stone) statues cost $150.\n8. We also know that 10% of Theodore's total monthly earnings go toward taxes, and that his total monthly earnings include both his profits from making statues, and taxes paid.\n9. So we can say 0.1*150 = (Theodore's total monthy earnings-Theodore's monthy profit)-X \n10. By simplifying this equation we get 15 (=5X)/Theodore's total earning (150-profit)-X 11. For this to be $15, X can't be more than $5 because that would mean less than $150 for total monthy earning.\n\n12. Therefore, the final answer is: \"X \u2260 5 and X < 5\"\nIf X = 5, profit must be at least $110 to equal $150, and so X = 10/15 which is impossible because the wood must cost at least $35 which does not fit.\n13.

By knowing the distance that Grant threw the ball and the total distance that Parker threw the ball, we can arrive at the answer.\nDistance = 25% of Total distance\n4. For Grant to throw the ball 25% of the distance Parker had thrown it, he would have to throw the ball 383 yards.\n5.

This is wrong because there are 4 rows in each row which makes a total of 16 rows (since each field has a total of 13 rows and 16 rows).\nOption B: Option B is telling us that that total number of rows would be 41. This is also wrong because if there are 2 fields with 13 and 16 rows combined it would equal 29. This shows that the total number of rows is not 41.\nOption C: Option C is saying that we need to find out the total number of corn in 1 or 2 fields. Considering 4 rows per field or total per 1 or 2 field, the total number would still be a sum of the number of rows in both fields. This implies that the total number of cobs would be atleast 1 and more probably two.\nOption D: Option D says that the total number of fields have 17 rows which is wrong since there are 13 and 6 rows in each field. Thus we must be having that the total number of row in both fields would be atleast a total of 19.\nOption E: Option E is telling us that the farm has grown less than 33 corn rows. This option cannot be correct since 33 is the number that we have already calculated to be the total number of corn rows in both fields and this option is telling us that we have less than 33 rows of corn. Therefore the correct answer should be the option E.\nSo the final choice in the question would be the option E.

For 20 bananas she needs 5cups of floss and that is half of it. 10 cups)\n4. Finally, we divide 20 by 10 to get answer of 2. The answer is 2.\nSo the final value is 2.\n\nInput:What is the only continent that does not border another continent?

Look at the question, its states the continent that does not border to other one is Antarctica.\n\n2. Then start eliminating the options we have. First, option (E) is saying that South America does border on it; we can eliminate this one.\nNow, look back at the question and you should see option (A) on Antarctica is written as the only continent that does border another. We can eliminate this too. \nNow, there are just options (B), (C) and (D) left. In case of looking at the globe, there are 4 continents. The question is stating that only 2 continents has border with another one.\nIf we look at the Africa and North America, we see that they border with Antarctica and South America, this makes us eliminate option (A). However, in case of option (B), Africa may have a border with Europe whereas North America may have a border with South America.\nTherefore, since we do not know exactly what continent Africa and North America", "answer": " 15"}

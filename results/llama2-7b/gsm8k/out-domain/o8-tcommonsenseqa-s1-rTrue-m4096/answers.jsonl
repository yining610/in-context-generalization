When we read the question, it asks for the average number of hours a person working at $10 per hour for one week can be expected to work. This indicates the worker is paid based on an hourly wage and the time would likely be measured in working hours.\n2. The given options C: $5, G: $6.50, H: $3 are not the average number of working hours as they contain a different element of measurement than the question asks for.\n3. The other options indicate average wages that differ for different amounts of time. The question asks for a worker who would generally expect to work a full week\u2019s hours, which would amount to an average wage of 40 hours.

He is not found in any other place. Choices:  A. He is a fisherman. B. He has moved. C. He is an angler. D.

We can immediately eliminate option A, which states the man is a fisherman. It does not describe why he would be found next to a\nfisherman, given that he may or may not be a fisherman himself, making this an invalid solution to\nthe problem.\nNext, we can eliminate option C, as the man cannot be a professional angler. Being an angler does not\nindicate any particular location with regard to a fisherman.\nFinally, option D does not provide much information about the situation other than that the\nman is in need of relocation. We cannot be sure where the fisherman is located, making this a\nsolution that is invalid.\nThis leaves us with option B, which states the man has moved.\nThis statement is sufficient enough to describe the relationship between the man and the\nfisherman since it provides sufficient information about why the man is not found elsewhere.\nTherefore, B can be eliminated as a solution to the problem because if", "answer": " 11000"}

This is the average water consumption per wash of laundry.\n\nAs regards the water consumption for washes for the load of laundry, the load will need to be washed three times and thus requires just about 2.12 fluid ounces to be washed the first time, 1.73 fluid ounce to be washed on the second time and 1.5 fluid ounce to be poured for the last wash.\n\nFor bleaches, the laundry needs to be washed by a light wash that will require an additional 2 fluid ounces on a load.\n\nFor the light wash, a wash of 2 gallons will amount to the laundry being washed six times.\n\nIf however for two of the washes, the wash is a heavy wash, then for the light wash, the washer will need to have an additional 2 gallons of wash.\n\nThere are two heavy washes in line for the laundry to be washed with 20 gallons at hand.\n\nThere are three regular washes planned for the load of launry and there are two bleaches planned for the load of wash, hence the final answer is 20 + 3 X 2.12 + 4 X 2", "answer": " 76"}

{"text": "Apple prices are 2/3 as expensive as oranges. Apples cost $0.40 per apple.\nInput: If the price of apples and oranges have both tripled, what percent has to be raised in order to raise the price by $0.10? Choices: 1/3 B: 2/3 C: 3/3 D: 100% E: 0%\nRationales:  1. The question is about the increase in cost of apples and orangers after they have both tripled.\n2. The rate of increase for oranges can then be calculated by dividing 300 by 3000.\n3. Rate of increase for apples can similarly be calculated by dividing by 200. \n4. This gives us the equation rate=3/200 or 1/60 for rate of increase in cost of appliers relative to the previous cost.\n5. The given scenario says that if the two ingredients triple in cost, the total increase is a $0.10 increase\n6. So the rate of increase in the ingredients needs to be a factor of $0.10 (which is 1/60).\n7. Thus, the correct answer must be a multiple of 1/60, which is 1/3 (Choice B).\nAnswer:1/3\n\n### Input :Why could a horse not be in a box?

Horse could not fit into a box, as a box has specific dimensions and a horse's body is too big. \n2. Horses are typically herbivores and cannot survive on their own in captivity for extended periods. \n3. They require extensive care, including food, water, and veterinary attention.\n4.

{"text": "Larry and Barry's total height can reach a height equal to Larry\u2019s height plus 1.985 times Barry's height.\n\n### Reasoning Steps\n\nReasoning steps are provided to explain the process of identifying the correct answer:\n\nStep 1 - The problem statement asks to find a height, so we look for an equation that will allow us to find the height.\n\nStep 2 - After looking at the information, we know the answers to all of the variables except the one we are trying to find. We have to identify what the variables relate to and what can be used to eliminate those variables.\n\nStep 4 - In the example image, the variables are \"Larry\" and \"Barry\" and the height is \"h\".  Since \"Larry\" and \u201cBarry\u201d are both human beings, we first know that both of them must be able to reach at least 5 feet to be able to pick apples of that height.  We also know that the total height would refer to the combined height of both Larry and Barry.\n\nStep 5 - Now that we know that neither of the variables is a height from the original question. Based on that information, we can eliminate \"Larry\" and use \"Barry\".\n\nStep 5a - Eliminate options that are not needed.\n\nStep 6 - Since we know that no variable is a \"height\", now we are only looking at options that have to do with length.  From the remaining options, only options \"shoulder height\" and \"height\" can possibly relate to the \"total height\".\n\nStep 7 - From this point, we know that the \"total height\" is not simply \"height\", so we eliminate option \"height\".  Since we use \"shoulder height\" in the solution of this problem, we will use that as our answer option in the answer choices.\n\nStep 8 - Since we know that \"barry\" is 5 feet, and the \"total height is not simply height\", 5 + 5 = 10 feet.  To find the total height of the group, we multiply 5 by 2 = 10.  The final answer is equal to the total height, which is 10 feet.\n\n### Example 2:  Larry wants to pick the last apple on this branch.  If Larry stands on", "answer": " 9"}

Which statement is correct about the sunflowers that were growing nearby? Choices: A: they always grow next to trees B: they are the most commonly grown flower C: they require lots of sunlight D: they can have leaves that fall off E: they are typically planted in groups of five\n#### RATIONALES\nI. Looking at the choices: \nWe can immediately eliminate options A: they always grow near trees and D: they can have fallen leaves.\nThese are false because sunflowers are often not planted next to trees, they can grow without a tree, and they usually have their healthy leaves.\nII. Then looking at each of the choices:\nChoices B: they are the best typically groan flower and E: they are often planted in group of five, are most likely true.\nIII. This leaves us with two options: B: they are the better typically grown flower, and E: they are typically grown in groups of five.\n1. \"Better\" simply refers to the \"higher quality\" version of something. For example, \"best\" could refer to a \"better\" version of something.\n2. So we need to check if the sunflowers that are located near a park are a better version of sunflowers. If they are, then the answer is B.\n2. So, sunflowers that grow in large numbers in a park would typically be", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": "Ursula's commercial should be 21 seconds long now.\n\n### Rationales\n1. To begin, we need to understand what the question is asking. The question is asking how long an earlier commercial will be after Ursula makes some changes to it.\n2. The commercial is 30 seconds long, or 0.5 minutes. And her boss wants her to shorten it by 30%.\n3. So, the question is essentially asking how long 30% of 0.5 will be.\n4. Now, 0.5 is half a minute, which means it consists of 60 seconds, the smallest unit of time of which we can work with.\n5. Now, how much will we have left if we reduce something by 30%? The answer is 0.3 multiplied by 60 or 18 seconds.\n\n### 5. The 30% that is given is 0.3. This means we have to reduce the 60 seconds by that number.\n6. Therefore we have 0.6 seconds left after reducing 60 seconds by 30%\n7. Since we work with the smallest unit of time, the minute, we have to convert our 0.6 to 60 seconds and divide by 60 since we want to know the answer to a question in minutes.\n8. So we arrive at 0.1 multiplied by 6 or 0.6 seconds which is less than 0.6, 60 seconds, and the 0.6 is the remainder after we divide 60 by 3\n9. The 0.6 that's not counted towards 60 is actually a remainder of 0.6, which means we have no seconds after 60 seconds.\n10. The amount of seconds remaining after reducing a 60-second commercial by 30% is zero, which is what the answer is supposed to be.\n\n### Output:The 30-second commercial is 21 seconds long.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis commercial will be 21 seconds.\n\n\n### Input 2:\nUrsula's marketing firm is using a 5-second ad for a commercial.

Our remaining options, then, are 1, 2, and 6. We know 3 from our guess, 5 because it's given - and her tantrums should at least last that long, and 6 because 6 = 3 + 2. (And since the question asks the total, not the average, it's not likely they're asking about one-minute intervals.) We're left with 2 because she sings for just 3 mins - but 6 mins if we include these two tantrums breaks. So, 6 * 3 = 18. She also sings for just 6 minutes, but we've added in the tantrums, so we want to subtract it instead of adding. Subtract 6 from 18 to give 12. Now for the remaining tantrum minutes.

A traditional oven is only capable of maintaining a set temperature by relying on the surrounding air condition to moderate how much hot air is leaked out of the oven.\n\n#### Cookies: It's what an oven is used to prepare. Cookies are a food product commonly baked in an oven.\n\n### \n\n#### Steam: Ovens often use steam to maintain a desired level of heat. Steam is a hot aerosol gas used in bakery ovens in combination with a steam injection system to bake food. The system injects a hot aerosol (steam) into the oven cavity. The steam and hot air mix and make the inside of the oven cavity hotter. The heat from the aerosol and the air inside the oven heat the food being baked inside. Steam is also an excellent convection air heat medium, meaning it is less likely to condense into water, unlike a gas such as nitrogen or oxygen.

We know that Alison bought 9 tubs, which means 3 large tubs and 6 small tubs.\n\n3. Using algebra, we get `3n + 6m = 9`, which we can use to eliminate m.\n\n4. Since m = 6, n = 3.\n\n5. Therefore, to figure out m = 6: we get n + m = 9, which gives us n = 3. So Alison bought 3 large tubs.\n\n6. As for the small tubs, she bought 6 of them.\n\n7. Let's say that each large tub cost $6, then each small tub will cost 6/3 dollars.\n\nAnswer:\n\nWe have 3 large tubs for $6 + 6 small tubs for 6/3 dollars totaling for $48.\n\nWe can calculate the small tubs cost by dividing $6 by 3, then finding the answer of the question.\n\nTo figure out $3.20, we can first say `6/3 = x; 6x = 6(x)`, where x is `2` for an answer of 3.20` dollars.\n\nThus, the answer is $3.20 for each small tub cost.\n\n### Output (the solution they expect): $6.00 or $2.00 is the answer.\n\n### Intermediate Reasoning Step:\n\n1.

In the past, watches used to be analog, meaning they only contained two hands, moving in a circular fashion to denote the number of hours since midnight. To tell the time, we have to look at the position of each hand relative to the 12 o'clock mark.\n\nThe correct answer", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "The teacher is angry, according to the friends, and they are not sure how a gift of what cost will make her happy.\n\nRationales:\n1. The question first asks how much does the gift of what cost will cost in dollars?\n2. For the given scenario, the teacher's friends have already paid out their 1/10th of the gift but 4 of them dropped out so their shares have to be split among the remaining 6 friends.\n3. Given that the 4 friends will be dropped out, and their shares can be split equally among the remaining 6, this will mean that each remaining share should be $8 more.\n4. This simply means that 4* $10 = 1/10 * (10 + 8 * 4) \n5. There are no changes in the total cost of the gift since the friend is splitting the cost on an equal basis. They originally said that each share of the gift would cost 100 dollars, so, that is still the total cost of the given gift. \n6. And finally when we apply this to the answer choices we get, B which states that each share is $8 more expensive to be around $108.\nAnswer:B\n\n\n\n### Input\n1.

The question is about describing a \"big, grey wolf\".\n2. The characteristics of the wolf are listed below, for reference:\n    - Size: about five feet tall at the shoulder.\n    - Fur: usually short, coarse and dark grey, but longer in winter. There is often a lighter colour on the chin, throat and belly.\n3. The first part of the question, \"I saw a big, gray wolf\", tells us that the \"big\" wolf was a grey wolf.\n4. The second part of the question \"it was not shiny\" excludes \"scratch\", \"black\" and \"fog\" as these are synonyms for \"shiny\".\n5.

You will want to know which of your choices are being used, and which are not. We already can eliminate option B, because it's talking about the remainder of the sales during the month if Frank sold 15 cars instead of 50. We also can eliminate options C and I, which are different ways of saying the same thing. We then narrow it down to D, F, H, and L.

That's what Frank has already done in the first 3 days, so that can't be right.\n\nWhat is the relationship between Frank's current sale numbers at the beginning of the month compared to his quota?

But, if we lose 4 cookies, which is the same as 4/40ths (because there are 40 total cookies), that is not the same as taking 40 cookies and subtracting 4 from that number. It is because in the second case, one less cookie is being subtracted, and the remainder becomes the number after the subtraction. Since there are no cookies in the remainder, the cookies that are left, which is the number after the substraction,", "answer": " 324"}
{"text": "480$\n#### Intermediate Reasoning:\n1. At the printers, a manuscript is $0.05/page\n2. A manuscript is $5.00 to have it bound (assuming it is 10% of 400 pages and thus multiplying by 5)\n3. 10 copies will be printed\n4. 10 copies means $0.5 per page and $5 per bound copies and the total is 13800+400 =$14200.\n5. The extra 2000 comes from being printed and bound 10x by the price of $0.5 and the 5.00 respectively. Hence, the total for the printing and binding is 14200+2000=$16200.\nAnswer: $16200  (480 pages x $0.5 + $5 print+ $4.50 print + $4 print+ $4 print + $4 print + $3 print = 16.200 dollars)", "answer": " 250"}
{"text": "The correct answer is 8 minutes.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Our first step is to eliminate the options we know don't add up. \n2. If the man takes the first route and has nothing to add on to the travel time because all the lights are green,  he will spend 10 minutes on this part of the trip.  This is what we know as option A: 10 minutes. \n3. Similarly, on the second route, we know that option B: 14 minutes is the correct time it takes him travel along the first road.\n4. Therefore A + B = 10 minutes and 14 minutes.\n5. However, we know that if all 3 stop signs are red, the answer will be 17 minutes.\n6. This is because no matter how many red signals there are, the trip will still be 10 minutes.\n7. However, if there were any green signals, that would add on to the total amount of time needed for the trip.\n8. Therefore the answer is the sum of the two values, which is A + B = 8 minutes in total.\n\n### Input:\"If I went on a hike through a forest today, where would I not look?\" Choices: A: at trees B: to the sky C: at my surroundings D: up and down E: towards a mountain\nRationales: As a first step, we should cross off answer options that do not make sense as they could have been given to see how we would choose from the remaining choices.\n\nAn answer from among the remaining answers is unlikely to be at my surroundings or towards a mountain as these do not make any sense.\n\nThe wording has hinted for us that there is a likely possibility that I will be facing the danger of looking ahead and behind.\n\nThis will mean I should probably be looking up and down rather than at trees as there are more branches to look for danger than merely at the ground.\n\nFor this reason, the most likely answer would be an E.\n\nThe remaining options would then be A-C.\n\nA and C would mean that I would be looking at my surroundings.\n\nSince I am not allowed to look at the trees or at anything else around me, all the other options are incorrect in that manner.\n\nAs a result, the answer", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "The total for the tickets will be $45.\n\n### Rationales: \n1. Since we know that there will be 6 people in attendance, we can use this information to find out how many adult tickets and how many child tickets will be purchased so that the total will be $45 for all tickets.\n2. So, the total number of tickets purchased is going to be 4 (4 adult tickets + 4 child tickets). Now, we need to calculate how much money they will need to spend to get the 6 tickets.\n3. The total amount spent for tickets will be $120, where 4 tickets are worth $48 and 4 more tickets are worth $96.\n4. All of this information suggests that adult tickets will account for $5 each and child tickets will account for about $10 each.\n5. Using these facts, we can determine that the amount each person should pay for their tickets is $5 plus $5 times the number of tickets that person will buy.\n6. In this case, there are 4 adult tickets and at least 4 child tickets. So the total amount for each person's tickets will be $60.\n7. If 5 other people come along for the show, the amount for each person'sc will be $55 per person. So, we need to divide the total amount of $60 by 5 to find out how much each person should pay for those 4 tickets: $60/5 = $12.\n8. After doing this, the total amount each person will pay is $12 plus $20, or $32.\n9. So, the total amount each family member pays is $12 (per adult), $17.50 (per child) = $30 total.\n10. The total amount each person pays is $45.\n11. Since $120 = $5(4) + $95(4), we can also say that $32 for each person is $420.\n\n### Input\n> You can pick up a pack of cigarettes on the corner for $12.

So, he makes $930 every week.\n3. Total compensation = workdays x 35 per day x 35 hours per day x $9 per hour\n4. So, he makes 350 every workday.\n5. Total compensation = hours per hour x $9\n6.

Choices: A: temperature B: heat C: warmth D: cold E: freezing\nRationales: We need to understand the meaning of the first and the second parts of the sentence separately.\n\n1. 'Tomorrow's temperature' refers to the temperature that will be in effect that particular day.\n2. 'will be lower than' indicates that the temperature in question is already higher than some other lower temperature.\n3. This suggests that we are comparing the original temperature to a lower one, which gives us the answer as option A: temperature.\n\nNow, we need to understand what is meant by 'the temperature in question'.  \n\n4. The second part of the sentence 'won't be lower than' suggests that the temperatures we will be looking at are not constant but actually moving between higher and lower values.  \n5. And when we consider that both values will be represented by just one number and will eventually reach equalities, 'won't be' translates to 'will not be lower than'.  \n6. Moreover, if we look closely at the values that the options offer, we can see that one of the values is always higher.  \n\n7. So, what we are essentially comparing is the value that is higher than the original temperature, with the one that is lower than it.  \n8. If we compare and subtract these temperatures, we get the answer as option E: freezing.  \n9. Since the temperature that we will be comparing will be higher than a lower one, we can subtract the values without affecting their status.  \n10. In other words, we can subtract the two temperatures and still have them refer to temperatures. And since the one we subtract will be higher, we will end up with the answer as freezing.  \n11.

{"text": "The answer is 14 pounds.\n\n### Input and Rationales:\nThe above question is a combination of a situation and number question. A number question asks the student to solve or write a problem involving counting or arithmetic operations. A combination of a situation and a number question asks the student the perform a calculation based on data presented in context.\n\nThe key to solving the above problem is to recognize that the given statements are insufficient to calculate the total amount of weight in pounds. We have two key sets of weights-the blue weights and the green weights.\n\n1. The first set of weights is 2 pounds each. (2 + 2 = 4)\n2. The second set of weights is 3 pounds each (3 + 3 = 6)\n3. The bar itself weigheds 2 pounds alone. (2 + 0 = 2)\n\nPutting this all together, we can conclude that the total amount of weight is 4 + 6 = 10 pounds. This solution is logical but the math involved can be made simpler. To do so, we can subtract the value of the bar from the solution. In other words, let us assume that the metal bar weighed 2 pounds and the total amount of weight was 10 pounds. The only thing required now was to determine the amount of weights in the blue weights (4) and the green weights (5).\n\n### The answer is 10 pounds, divided by the value 2 (the weight of the bar), or 5 pounds, rounded down to the nearest 10th.\n\n### A student said: This is simple. 10 pounds divide by 2, and that is 5 pounds.\nWhen the student is learning the concept in school and uses division to solve an arithmetic question, the answer would be 5 pounds. \nHowever, this is the round-to-the nearest tenth rule in calculating the answer. Because the student is likely to round to the nearest whole number after solving, this would make the student confused in math.\n\n### Example: A student says: I'm really confused.

If si = 2i, then each player would get 20 dice, so Jerry cannot have twice as many dice as a player with 20 dice (like Ivan). So, if each player gets different number of dice, then the number of dice can only be 2n for at least one integer n \u2265 0 because we could only combine 2i and 2j to get 2.

{"text": "She paid $24 per month in taxes.\n\n### Rationale:The task is asking the total amount of taxes paid per month at an unknown level. We already know that the person is paying $42 per month in expenses. Therefore, the total household tax expenses has to be greater than $42.\nNow, it's also implied that the person pays a share of the taxes along with other housekeeping expenses, which makes sense as she contributes for necessities. Moreover, we also have to consider the fact that taxes payments depend on income and a person's salary. And because Angie pays $80 per month, we can use basic algebra to find the difference between how much tax per month is paid based on an unknown number, tax:T. When comparing tax to 80, we get a simplified equation tax : 80 = t (tax:80 = t):\n\nLet I be the value used. Since the question only focuses on what taxes are, the tax amount could be any dollar amount from 0 to 100. So, we plug in 0 in for I to find that T = 24 (24:80 = 00):\n\nUsing the same equation to find the answer for 1, the tax could be any number from 0 to 80, and so we plug in 80 for I: T = 24.

Choices:  B: turn on hot water first. C: run cold water first. D: check the temperature scale. E: take a cold shower. F: warm up hot water.\nRationales: First let's eliminate options A and D. A) turn on hot water first and D) check the temperature scale are incorrect because they require more time than what is necessary to deal with the problem. If the water is at a high temperature, turning on the hot water won't help that much. We won't be in the cold long enough to \"check\" the scale.\n\nNext let's eliminate options E) take a cold shower and F) warm up hot water. Although there may be a problem with the water at the house's temperature scale, there isn't any reason to believe that you should take a cold shower or warm up the hot water.\n\nAfter elimination, the only other options are B) turn on hot water and C) run cold before hot water.\n\nNow with C) running cold before getting hot water, even though the water is at a higher temperature, you won't be able to get burned as fast because the water came out cold before it got hot. You have to wait even longer for the water to get a higher temperature than what you are used to, this way we'll be able to reduce the temperature of the water more than if we use option A) turn on the hot water first.\n\nAfter all of the elimination, we can see that C), run cold before hot water, is the best answer.

That leaves us with the remaining four options.\n\nOption B: 1903 B: 1931 C: 1957 D: 1985\n\nFor option B, if we consider that more people were born in 1990 in America than in the other given years, we can also say that they were born in the decade 1990 to 1999.\nIn 1993, then, fewer people could be expected to be born.

So, according to this, the day which the question is being asked, the answer is always expected to be that of the day the person is responding.\n3. The answer to that day is the day he/she was born, unless the day he/she is responding is not the day he was born\n4. There's only one choice that matches this criteria: the answer will always be the day he was born. The other options don't make sense.\n5. The day before or following the day the person is born is never exactly the day that he was born.\n6. Therefore the only choice that fits the given information is the correct one, A: the day following the the day he's (or she's) born.\nAnswer: A\n\n Input: What might a car do if the accelerator doesn't work? Choices:  B: move slowly C: stop at stoplights D: slow down E: run out of gas\nRationales: Looking at the given choices: \n1.

We can eliminate: C: stop at stop lights, D: slow down, and E: run out of fuel. \n4. These do not indicate that it will be moving slowly. So that leaves only B moved slowly.\nAnswer: B\n\n### Input:\"How often do I need to work out when I'm pregnant?\"\n\n1. The keyword in the question is \"PREGNANT\".\n2.

{"text": "The people can live in 12 apartments with 4/6=2/3 of them occupied. So the maximum = 2*3 = 6 people.\n\n### Rationales:Intermediate Reasoning Stepmethod:\n1. If there are two types of flats with different numbers of residents in each apartment = 12\n2. One third of the 12 flats = 4 occupied by people in each flat.\n3. One third of the population of the occupied flats = 4 residents in each apartment.\n4. Therefore the total number of residents = 4 for each of the 6 occupied apartments plus 4/6 x 12 floors = 6.\n\n### Input :In a city, there are 2 million apartments.

There is also a special request for 6 grams of salt. How much is 1 cup flour?\n\n### Question:\nWhat is the meaning of \"9 cup flour = 6/6 * 200 g flour\"?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. We can't solve this directly, so we need to simplify it. 2. Since \"9 cup flour\" is the amount we start with (9 cups x 454 g/cup = 4,036 g), the recipe's ingredient of \"9 cup flours\" is equivalent to 200 gr, 6 grams of flour.\n3. When looking for the math meaning of the sentence, we can simplify it by looking at each part: \n4. \"4,036 * 6/6 = \" means: (4,036/6) = \"4,034/6\".\n5. So, 4,034 \u00f7 6 = 677, the recipe's flour ingredient can be simplified to 677 grams of flour - but it's still not enough to finish the rest of the recipe.\n6. So the recipe actually needs \"677 + (200+6) = 940 grams of flour, which will still leave about 123 grams of flour over.\n7.

Turn the knob (wet)\n   3. Pump the handle (fatty)\n   4. Wait for water (wet).\n3. Opening the faucet does not make us wet, because we are dry and we can't be both wet and dry at the same time.\n4. Turning the knob does not directly make us wet because we are not wet to begin with, however the water is turned on.\n5. Pumping the handle does not directly make us fat because we cannot be fat without water.\n6. Thus, it must be the water that we have to wait for. Water making us watery does seem to make much sense, but we know it's water, and we will be exposed to it once it comes out of the faucet. We can therefore conclude that we cannot be dry and fat at the same time, so the water directly makes us fat and wet.\n7. Now, going back to our question.\n8. When we use the water, it can't be just any old water, because we'd have to do a lot of the steps again for every single time.\n9.

We know there is some distance and time component that gives the answer, and we know that the person must know how much time it takes for the sun to move through \"its orbit\" in order to answer the question.\nNow we have 2 choices remaining. A: a minute and C: a day.\nBut looking at the given choices and elimination we can determine the sun does not travel through an orbit in a minute, and also we know that to travel through an orbit it would take at least a day.\nWe also know that A: a minute is not the correct answer, so we can eliminate that choice.\nOur answer choice is either B: a year or C: a day.

Anything with either a plus or a minus sign (+ or -) that is not a whole number\n3. Anything with only a minus sign\n4. Anything with lots of minuses\n5. Anythes with lots of pluses\nRationales\n1. First, let's look at what a negative term is not. A negative term is not only an expression with a minus sign, but there is more to it than that.\n2.  -5x -4y +2z is not a negative term because it contains an integer.\n3. 2x^2 +3y -1z^4 is not a negative term either because it contains a non-integer exponent term.\n4. We should get rid of the choices 4 and 5, as they don't contain any minuses at all.\n5. Now option 4. 5-6-2-7 is definitely a negative because everything inside the parentheses is less than zero.\n6. Thus 5-6-4-9 is not a negative term.\n7. Option 1 is certainly a negative term.\n8. However, option 3 is not a negative term, because negative terms only contain negative numbers, and we have numbers like x and y.\n9. In fact, option 3 could be expressed as 8x -2y. 8x is not necessarily a negative term.\n10. So, this option is out of the question.\n11. Option 2 then becomes the choice with the only answer that could be a possible positive term, negative term or either of them, which is option 2.\n\nAnswer: 2. Anything that starts with a minus or a plus that is not an integer. This can be any fraction, division, subtraction, or multiplication.\n\nInput:What are two different operations in math?

In order to make the income per hour greater than $125, the number of hours worked has to be more than 12.5, which means the minimum income per hour needs to be greater than $12.125, and in order for that to be possible, the minimum income per day will have to be $500. \n5. This indicates that the only option that would not be worth it to Alex is option 5: NO! What is in the answer of $125/4 = $15? \n6. The income per hour in this case would work out to $31.25, which is less than $125. This means that the given minimum income per day ($500) would only be achievable by 6 hours worked per day. \n7.

So, the total price is $300 ($15 for the bedframe and $300 to buy the bed itself).\n\n1. Then, we need to solve the following math question to get to the answer: the bed frame cost 10 times the price of the bed ($10 \\times 300 = $3000). So, the total cost for the bed and the bed frame is $3000.\n2. To get to this number, James is paying $75 for the bed frame + $3000 to buy the full bed ($75 + $300 = $75 + $3 in total). Then the overall cost of the bed and the bed base is $3075. Then we are told the deal is 20% off which would make the total cost to buy the full bed $2470.50.\n3. To reach the final answer of $15 for the cost of the bed frame we need to divide $2470 by 1.5 because after the 20% off the total is $2470 which divided by 1.5 is $15.5. Therefore, the overall cost was $3075-$15.5 = 3000 + 15.5 = $3015.5.\n\n### Output: The following is a 3x3 square puzzle.  There is one shape in three of the rows.

Thus, Dino is not \"the fastest.\" The correct answer to the question is B: he is the fastest but he could be faster. \n\n### Explanation:\nWe can conclude that no object besides Dino is capable of traveling at the same speed as him or can even travel faster, and therefore, \nit is logical that he must be the fastest, since there is nothing else at the same level of performance. \nWhen it is clear that Dino is indeed the fastest, the question", "answer": " 27"}

So, to answer the question, we need to know how Bobby will go about getting new shoes.  We can then answer the question based on the information provided for that action. \n3. Looking at the choices.  A: cobbler is the only choice where Bobby needs to get new shoes by an action. \n4. So, Bobby needs to buy some shoes; cobbler is the choice we will pick. \n5. We now need to know how the cost is represented for the cobbler. \n6. Shoes are sometimes referred to as a boot as in bootmaker.  Sometimes, people also mention that a bootmaker is a person who makes shoes. \n7. However, both bootmaker and cobbler mean a person who repairs, restores, or makes shoes.  They are synonymous. \n8. Because they are synonymous, we can substitute one for the other and the answer will remain the same. \n9. Therefore, the choice: cobbler is now bootmaker due to that substitution.  We now have only four choices. \n10. We need to know the action Bobby would take to get the shoes.  Let\u2019s think about it. \n11. We know that after purchasing the shoes, Bobby will leave the shoes or the shoes will be delivered. \n12. Then, either a separate individual or the cobbler will make the shoes. Then, eventually, there will be one more action that happens at the end. \n13. That extra action is when Bobby gets the shoes; in a way, these shoes will be delivered to the shoes.  So, the delivery act is the end, and the cobbler will then put the completed shoes on the table. \n14. It remains to see a relationship between the cobbler and the shoes.  Because the cobbler will be charged a fee, or the cobbler can be paid, cobbler is a person who either pays to the cobbler, or the cobbly can get paid. \n15.

Choices: 1: The plane would slow down. 2: The plane will drop at a faster rate. 3: The plane would go down faster. 4: The plane would slow to a stop. 5: The plane would crash.\n\n#### Rationales:\n1. The question is about a plane that is climbing in the atmosphere.\n2. It is common for a plane to lose altitude or altitude control at higher elevations due to the fact that air resistance becomes a larger factor at higher levels, affecting the plane's ability to fly.\n3. A plane without control may eventually crash, but would not typically slow down gradually or stop.\n4. In a rapid descent, a plane would go down faster, and would not necessarily slow to a stop nor crash in this scenario. \n5. The only relevant option to answer this question is 2: The plane would drop at a faster rate, which is a common occurrence when a plane loses control or altitude over high terrain.\nAnswer: 2: The plane drops at a faster rate.\n\n### Input\nA penguin was traveling and he saw someone running.

The first thing we do here is to eliminate the option A: 4.4, since it is not the same value of cats as the given number of dogs. \n2. Next, there are two options that involve the number of cats. The first is option D: 8. Since the number of cats in the compound is 20% lower than the number of dogs, this is the correct option. \n3. Thus, the total number of animals of option D can be calculated as: \n```\n20x(1 + (80/100)*20)\n```\n4. The final options to look at are the options that refer to the number of frogs. First, let's eliminate C: 80 and E: 128, since they contain the exact number of cats as the options A: 4.85 and B: 8, but are still incorrect. \n5. So, the only options left for the questions to do are option D: 8 and option E: 12. We can eliminate option E: 160 as that is the total sum of the options.

Choices: 1: A:  It depends on the car 2: B: about a minute 3: C: more than 20 minutes 4: D: about 25 minutes 5: E: 15 mins \nRationales: Demonstration: 1. For a car to travel from \"100km to 0\", they'd need to make it from one hundred kilometers away to the stop.\n2. Since the question did not specify a particular car, the best one can estimate would depend on the type of car and the road and traffic conditions. It may take different lengths of time depending on the vehicle. \n3. There are many possible reasons for this; one possible reason is that the car may be slow due to its poor condition, obstructions on the road, or dense traffic.\n4. Another reason could be that the car may be going uphill, which would slow it down.\n5. In summary, it depends on the conditions of the car, the road, and the traffic.\n\nChoices: 1. For this choice, option A seems to be the appropriate choice. \n\n2.

{"text": "Answer:\nShe bought: 11 snowflakestamps + 30 truck  - 13 rosestamps = 44 stamps.\n\n### Explanation:\nDemostration:  When considering the number of snowflake, truck and rose stamps, we start by noting that the first part of the question specifies that Bella bought 10 stamps which have a snowflake image.\n\n\n\nWe are not told precisely how many snowflake stapms Bella originally bought. However because she bought 11 more snowflake stems, we can reason that she originally bought 11 snow flake stamps, otherwise she would not have bought anymore now.\n\n\nWe are also not told when and what Bella originally bought regarding the truck stems. However because Bella bought 9 more trout stems than snowflake, we can reason that originally Bella did not have a truck stamp for every 10 snowflake staps she had.\n\n\nWe can't conclude much more at this stage because we are not told what Bella bought first. Nonetheless we can infer that Bella also bought stamps which has a rose design, but she bought more of the truck stamps and bought fewer of the rose.\n\nSince the truck had 9 more than the snowflake and rose has 13 fewer than the truck, we can infer that the rose has 13 less than the truck for every 9 truck stamps.\n\nIf the three stamps have a common denominator, all we need to do is multiply by the denominator and that is what their numbers are now. In this scenario the denominator is 10. So,\n\n\nBella bought 11 more of the snowflake stanks = 11 11 = 110\nBella bought 9 more of the trucks stamps =9 *11 = 99\nBella bought 30 more of the truck designs= 13 *11 = 133   \n                                                    \n\n\nThen 110 + 99 +133 = 342 stamps.

You'll arrive at $57 as Mary's balance.\n\n\n### Input\uff1aHe has his money in a shirt he is wearing where? Choices: A: sleeve B: pocket C: side D: back\n\n### Rationales:\nIt can be determined from the context that \"where he has his money\" implies he's put his money somewhere on his person. And since he has his money in a place related to his clothes, it has to be on his clothes himself, not just inside a bag he carries or a place within a house he lives in.\n\nWith that in mind, when deciding from choices A, B, C, D we can easily exclude B and D.\n\nBoth of choices B, C can rule out by noticing \"money\" and \"pocket\" are both common words so if \"money in a pocket\" doesn't match well with the given context, \"money in a sleeve\" should be easier to match. This becomes reasonable when we realize in terms of convenience, a sleeve is closer to someone's hand(or hand equivalent) so it seems like a better choice of where to put money in to easily access than a pocket.\n\nSo we only have C, D to choose one of them. We can still eliminate C since \"money in a shirt\" seems unrelated to choices C and D. We will need to be the first word to match with \"money\" and also to match with \"where\".\n\nAnd it only leaves one option which is D: back.\n\nNow what are we going to answer?\n\nIf we find out our money is on our back in a shirt we're wearing, we should be able to just take that money with ease.

First, for the first three turns:\n\n23 = 1 - (8 + [X + 5]) Substitute in our values\n\nRearrange\n\n23 = -5 - ([X] + 8)\n\nSolve for X = 17\n\n23 = (-5) - ([17] + 8) This substitution is correct because after going through three turns, the car has gone to make the 4th turn which says we travel a specific distance after the 3rd right hand turn, we know that're our answer should be 17 and the distance traveled after the 4th turn is 20.\n\nAnswer: 20 m\n\n### Inputs:\n\n#### Task for the person:\n\n- Answer the following grade math question\n\n- A: oil refinieries\n- B: office\n- C: school\n- D: backpack\n- E: write sentences on paper\n- F: write down your full name\n- G: write down your phone number\n- H: write \"I am very excited\"\n- I: show picture\n- J: own home\n- K: draw a picture of a house\n- L: write down a sentence with the most words that are spelled correctly and that you pronounce correctly\n- M: write down a sentence that contains the most syllables\n- N: write down a sentence\n\n#### Task for your partner:\n\n- Answer to the grade math question\n- Write your phone number\n- Write down \"I am very excited\n\n#### Task for yourself:\n\n- Write my phone number\n- Write write down a sentence with words that are spelled and pronounced correctly\n- Write", "answer": " 10"}

Choices:  B: 10 \nC: 5 \n\nD: 4\n\nRationales: The question asked how much I have if ____ is equal to ____. We can read this as, how much I have if __=_ (meaning that what is to the right of '=' must equal what is to the left of the '='). We know that what is to the left is half, but we do not know what is to the right. This means that we must be able to work out what is equivalent to half. To do this, we use the following method:\n\n1. We see that we are given two choices.\n2. We know that these cannot both add up to half as that would be an impossible sum which means that one of these choices must not be possible.\n3. Since we cannot have 5 and 10, then this must be 10 and 5.\n\n### Inputs:How much is $5 plus what is 15? Choices: \n\nA. $6 B. $7\n\n\n\n\nRationales\nThe question is asking what the sum of the two numbers I am given is.\nTo work this out, we need to look at each term separately. Firstly, $5 is one number and then we have $15. We can look at $15 on its own and see that it equals 1 + 5. Then we look at $5 and see it as 5. We add five to one (5+1) and we get six. Five and 15 together equal 20 and five plus 15 is 20. This is the same as $5 plus $15.\n\n##Input: How much is 200 divided by 15?

{"text": "780.\n\n### Reasoning: \nWe can first eliminate option A, as it involves adding more than the amount of photos taken on the second day to the total collected on the trip.\n\nNext, let's look at the remaining options. Option B is incorrect because if Lilah's family added all photos of the trip, there would already be more photos in the family's collection in the gallery. We can also eliminate options C and D because they add even more photos to the gallery, and the question asked for the \"total number of photos in the family' family gallery. Hence, the total number of photos would already exceed 800, and these options would cause more excess.\n\nSo, the only choice that is adding 800 fewer photos is option A: 400.\n\nOption D asks us to calculate the average number of photos Lilah's family would add in a day. In this case, we know that they added half as many photos on the first day. On the second day, they added 120 photos which is more than half that number.\nTo find the average, we divide the smaller number by the larger, giving us 0.5/0.6 or 5/6. We can check that 0.5 + 0.6 + 5/6 == 1.0 or that the average number of photos per day equals 1.0.\n\nSo, to answer this correctly, we need to be familiar with the \"average\" concept, but it's not one needed for the questions in the main passage, and shouldn't be introduced here.", "answer": " 920"}

Choices:  It would not clean dishes A: because it would be a waste of water B: because they could not have any water if they ran the dishwash  C: because you cannot wash dishes without water D: because they would need more water to clean just as many dishes as they put into the dishwasherer\nRationales:\n\n1. This question is based on an underlying assumption that we can choose not to run a dishwasher if we do not have dishes to wash.\n2. However, the purpose of running a dishwashing is to wash dishes. If the dishwashing does not have any dishes to wash, it will not have the possibility of washing any dishes and will be completely useless. Therefore, this answer is incorrect. \n3. Option D is incorrect because you can put more water into the machine than there are dishes to wash and still run the dishwasshing. Once the dishwassher runs, any excess water flows out and goes down the sink. In other words, just adding more water into the dishwassshering will not help it to wash more dishes than it can hold.\n4. Thus the correct answer is B, because you can't have a dishwash without water.\nAnswer: B. You need water to run a dishwashe\n\nInput: As a person is going through the alphabet, where is W?

{"text": "The owner of a Turkish Restaurant ordered three different packages from three different butcherm. If all the ground the beef ordered weighed 10 pounds, how much did each butcher deliver in how many packages?\n\nAnswer: B: 30\n\n### Explain why your response is correct:\n\nThe owner of the Turkish Restaurant received 100 pounds of ground beef from the other three butchers. According to the question, the first butcher dropped off 10 packages of ground beef. If a package of beef weighed 10lbs, this means that when he dropped his package, it weighed 10 pound, meaning it was 2 pounds heavier than the ground beef already weighed by the other butchers.\nThe second butcher delivered 7 packages of ground beef, which means the ground beef that he delivered probably made the 10 pound bags that the first butcher dropped by 3 pounds. The third butcher then dropped the last 30 pounds of ground beefe.\n\nSo when all of the deliveries were combined, they made up 100 pounds. If they each weighed 2 or 3 pounds, then there were 50 packages.\n\nIf all six packages weighed 2 pounds and five packages weighed 3 pounds, it would add up to 100 pounds (89 pounds +26.5 pounds)\n\n### Conclusion:\nSo in conclusion, the three butchers dropped off 10, 7 and 30 pounds of meat to the restauran.

{"text": "A: $43.20\n\n### Demomstration: Input: A one-year subscription to \"The New Yorker\" is offered with a 35% discount. The normal cost of the newspaper is $60.00. How much does the reduced price now cost?\nRationales:\n\n1. To begin, we can write the original cost as $60 and the discounted price as $45 per year. Then with simple multiplication we can set the discounted price multiplied by 12 as the original cost, $900 divided by 0.65 gives us $1342.85. Which is the answer.\n2. To find the value of 45 divided by 0.35, we can divide both sides by the same number. So, 45 /.35 = 127.14285714285. Which means that, as a proportion, 45 is reduced to 127.

{"text": "Herbert will be 133 years old.\n\n### Rationale:\nTo solve this problem, we first need to understand the question and the information it provides. The question asks how old Herbert will be next year, given that Kris is currently 24 years old and Herbert is 10 years her junior.\n\nWe can then start to find and estimate the values of the variables. It is given that Kris is 29 years old. If we consider this to be 0, 1 year is 14 days, and 2 years is 28 days, which means that Kris would now be 24 years old. This gives us an initial value of Kris' age of 24.\n\nFor Herbert, we know that Kris is 10 years older than him. We can then estimate Herbert's age by knowing his relative age. We can then write his age in a simplified equation as follows:\n\nHerbert(y) = Kris(y+10), where:\n\nHerbert is the current age of Herbert,\nKris is the current age of Kris\nKris(y+1) adds 10 years to the age of Kris to account for being Kris's younger brother and so on. \n\nRe-writing our original equation, we can see that Herbert(y) = 24, which indicates Herbert's age is 14. To find out the age next year, we can then add an extra 10, which will give us Herbert's age next year of 24. To find out how old Herbert will be the year after that, we can again add 10 which leads to Herbert being 34 years old. This continues indefinitely as illustrated below:\n\nHerbert's Age Next Year = Kris' Age This Year + 10 years...\nHerbert's age Last Year = Herbert's Age This Year + 9 years....\nHerbert's Aged Next Year = Herbert's age Last Year + 8 years....\nHerbert, 100 years old....\nHerbert, one year old....\nHerbert, one second old. \nWe can see that this will then make Herbert be 133.

{"text": "Missy, a young lady aged 7-8 years, had started using a giant piggybank to put her change after searching her house. After 4 yrs, the bank was opened up. The bank contained $450. So, if Missy is putting $500 per year, her first year would contain $100.  If the second year, she is putting $200, then the total is $350.  If the third year she is putting $400 and the fourth year, she is putting more that $400. So, the third time for Missy means the second year. Therefore, Missy put in $800 in the third year. Her fourth year, $1600 was put in the bank. So she put in $2400 this year.

Where did she speak from?\n\n### Instructions:Answer the question by choosing from the list of options.\n\n### Rationale:The question is asking \"where did she speak from?\" Here's a quick reminder on pronouns. We've already used \"she\", but pronouns \"it\" (they/their/themselves) are not allowed in the pre-algebra test. The pronouns in the options are: \"me\", \"us\", \"our\", \"yours\", \"myself\", \"herself\", \"himself\", \"itself\", and \"themselves\". So, it's safe to guess that there won't be any references to \"mine\", \"yours\", or \"ours\". Now look at the rest of the \"her\"'s, not just \"her\" as we've already used it in the word \"her\". \"itself\" and \"themselvesthemselves\" are self-referential pronouns, which means they are referencing themselves, so they are invalid pronouns to refer to someone else. So we cross them out. Similarly, \"them\" is a plural pronoun but we're only looking at singular, so cross that out as well. \"I\" is referring to someone within the same context, so it's pretty clear that \"I\" is not referring to the woman speaking to John. We can now say that \"me\", \"myself\" or \"herself\" are options to choose from. Now, which \"I\" and \"her\" will be used in the context of what? It's pretty clear that the woman (who was speaking) will be used to the context, so \"herself\" makes the most sense and it's the only option we have that fits the criteria.\n\n### Answer:Herself\nNotes For More Refinement:\nIt may seem like a bit of overkill but if we're at this step, this is the absolute minimum to get you to the answer.

{"text": "The answer is 88 tires.\n\n### Rationales: 1) A used car lot has 16 motorcycles among the 24 total vehicles for sale. Then, if a third of the vehicles are from this set, this indicates that 24 minus 16 minus 1/3 of 24 equals 6. 2) There are 11 cars on the lots with spare tires included, so if a quarter of the cars are this set, then 3/4 of the vehicles is 23 minus 11. So 3/4 of 24 minus 23 gives us that 24-23 is 1/2 of 24 minus. 3) In math, if a fourth of the cars have a tire included, 4/4 of 23 is 8/5 of 23 is that 23 minus 8/5 is 23 minus an 8/5 of cars, which is an 8/5 multiplier of the cars with spare tires included. But to get the tires, it's 8/5 multiplied by 3/2. The total is 17.5 times 3/2 and that equals 8.5 multiplied by 2, which is 88.

One story is 15 feet. The only rope being is sold is 25 feet long but Tom loses 25% when he lashes them together. How many pieces of ropes will he need to buy.\n   Rationales: Intermediate Step: First, we note that Tom needs to lower a 25 foot rope 6 stories because a story is equivalent to 15 feet.\n\n   So, 25 divided by 15 is equal to one story.\n\n   Because Tom must lower his 20 foot rope 6 times, one story equals 6 stories.\n\n   So the total number of feet Tom will need is 6 times 15 feet or 90 feet. \n\nInput: Tom needs rope to lower a 20 foot ropes down 6 times, that is down 1 story.  One story is 16 feet.  The only length of rope available to Tom is 60 feet but he will lash them together and lose 25%. How many pieces of rops does Tom need to buy?\n  Rationales: 1.Now that we have clarified how to find the total length of rope we are looking for, we will plug in the rest of the givens. What we know from the question is that Tom is lowering his rope down 6 times.\n  So let's substitute 100 into the second number in the statement for 16.  We know the length of rope is 75 ft.  We also know Tom lashes together his rope. \n2. What we've found is that we need to multiply the number of feet we need by seven-fifths. \n3. 100 x 0.8 = 80\n4.

{"text": "He started with 50.\n\n### Input 1:The student is asked to find the amount of money they need to save for each week until the end of the month, as well as the amount they will receive after their tax return.\n\n### Rationales:1.The question asks about the amount of money that needs to be saved each week and the amount that will be received after the tax return.\n2.To solve this, we can first write an equation relating the two, where m is the amount needed to be saved and t is the amount received after the tax return: m+t=x\n3.We can set this formula equal to the desired amount, y, giving y=m + t.\n4.This equation allows us to find m by solving it for m: m=y-t\n5.Next, to find the amount needed to be saver each week, we can substitute the formula for m from this equation, giving: m=y-52\n6.This formula can be simplified, giving m=(y-52)/52\n7.This equation can be simplified further to get: m=y-4\n8.Because we are given the total amount saved and the amount received from the tax return, we can plug the values into this formula to find y, the amount needed to be save for each week: y= (50-42)/2=1. This tells us that if an individual with 50 dollars decides to save for a month, they will only need to save 1 dollar each week for the month. \n9.The tax return would increase this amount to 55 dollars.\n10.Answer: The amount the student needs to save in order to make the total amount they have to be equal to the amount they have saved and the tax return is 1 dollar.\n\n### The students need to find how much money they are missing if they can only take out a certain amount of money.  \n\n### Input - How much money is available to the student after the tax return?

Choices:  M: $10 B: $5000 C: $0 D: $9800 E: $98\nRationales: First, based on the question we can conclude that Aaron goes to the grocary store to buy something.\nNow, we can eliminate $0 and $9800. We do this for the following reasons:\n1. $0 tells us that Aaron cannot spend any money in the whole trip. This is an extreme situation that cannot be applied to a problem about money. \n2. $9800 tells us that Aaran must have spent $9800 and has no money left at the end. \n3. Therefore, we can eliminate $9800 as an option. \n4. However, we cannot eliminate $0. \n5. The only option that would allow Aaron to spend more than $10 is $5000.

The options \"A\" and \"C\" seem to indicate that Sally and Mark got two different amounts of gas that they had to pay for individually. But, Sally and Mark together can only have one total amount of gas, so \"A\" and \"B\" cannot be the answer.\n2. We cannot choose \"E\", since this option says that Sally and Mark together paid $6.10. Now, what makes sense is that each individual has to pay for the amount of gas that they consume.

B: We bought a coloring book for $4, but we spend $4 on a coloring book. So the change you get should be -4.\n3.  C: After adding the cost of the color books and peanut packs, you get a total of $18.40. Subtract $25 from that number, and you get -6.60. Multiply that by -1, as we already need to give the cashier $6.60, and the result is -1\n4.  D: This is the correct answer.\n\nRationales: (Cont.)\n\n1. We just subtract the remaining balance from the total, and we get $17 as the amount we should have left.\n2. Therefore, -106.60 is the answer to how much she gave to the cashier.\n3. Thus, the stuffed animal would cost -106. 60.\n4. Since she gave $17, the remaining balance should be -106. (Cont.)\n\n### Demystification:B: In this question, the cashier took the total of an item. The $25 she received is then subtracted from that total to get back how much we were charged. \nRationales:B: In this example we bought two books. So they cost $8. \nThere are also $4.40 peanut packs in the $16.80. We\u2019ve bought eight books so far, so four books stay. So, if 4/8 + 4.40 = 4, then how much does one book cost? C: Since coloring books were $4 each, we were charged $8 because you bought two books so far. They have the same quantity, so $4 + $4 becomes $8. This also counts as the $4 and $4.40 for the peanuts.

The depth in July = How many feet deep the River will be by mid- July. \n\n8. Depth in July minus Depth in may, give the answer.\n\n9.

Tammy played with Joe and caught 20 times.\n4. Now, this information could be useful to us if we are trying to answer a question.\n5. The question is about finding the number of times that Tammy caught the ball. Hence, we can use the information about the total number of total throws and the number of times each person caught the ball.\n6. We can find the number of times Derek threw the ball by subtracting the number of times he caught the ball (which we know is 17) from the total number of balls thrown (24).\n7. The answer is that Derek threw 7 times.\n8. Similarly, we can find the number of throws that Tammy made by subtracting the number times she caught the ball (which is 20) by the total number of throws made (24).\n9. This brings us to the conclusion that Tammy threw the ball 4 times.\n10. Therefore, the number of catches made by Tammy would be 24 minus the number of throws she made.\n11. That would be 24 - 20 = 4 catches.\n12. So, the answer would be C: 4.\n\n### Summary:\nThere are a number of ways to answer the questions on the MCC practice tests.

{"text": "Answer: 5 cents per package per day\n\n```\nRationales:\n1. We know that Gary owns a distribution center that processes 100,000 packages per workday.\n2. We know that the second distribution center processes three times the volume of his first, or 300,00 packages per work day.\n3. Also, Amazon makes 5 ct$ profit per package.\n4. So, the first center makes a profit of $50,000 per day\n5. Now,  multiplying the days per week is $50,012.50 per week\n6. Now that we have the daily profit from his first distribution center, we know that the second center makes 3 times as much profit per day, or $150,037.50 per week.\n7. Multiplying the two makes 200,049.50 ct$ profit per week from just these two centers. \n8. We still have to include profit from center 1.\n9.

If we were talking, for example, about the person we're speaking to, then we should use Mr., not M. If, then, someone says \"Mr. Thomas, can you help me now?\" Mr. Thomas is a person and it's referring to the person we are addressing (using M would be wrong), and therefore we capitalize Mr. as a noun to indicate the name of that person. Therefore, option C would be the correct choice. 5) Now, the sentence that follows the option is describing a situation where Mr. Thomas is running to catch a bus, so M is a noun and therefore we should capitalize it when stating something about that person. So, the sentence should read Mr. Jones \"No time to talk, _I've_ got to run and catch _my_ bus\" So said Mr. Jones.

{"text": "To calculate exactly how many cupcakes Robin ate, we need to first add up the ingredients and multiply the total number of ingredients together. Since Robin baked 5 cupcakes, that means Robin's recipe calls for 5 cupcakes. Since she used 2 cups of chocolate sauce for 4 cupcakes and twice as much for the 5 cupcakes for a total of 5, we know that there were 5 cups of sauce altogether. \n\n### Response Conclusion: To find out how many cups of sauce were used, we multiply 2 by 5. Since Robin used 2 cups overall, each cup of sauce had been used twice. So, Robin ate five times how much sauce was used overall. Since there were four cups of sauce used for the four cupcakes and twice that for the five cupcakes, she ate 12 cups of sauce total.

{"text": "Georgia has 8 fewer pieces of stationery than Lorene.\n\n### Explain your process:\nFirst, we assume that the given options are all stationery as they're all nouns. \nSecond, we understand it's talking about how many fewer pieces Lorene has than Georgia.\nThird, we note that there is no reference to any arithmetic operation here such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.\nTherefore, what we are being asked is the mathematical relation between the two quantities as a function of the statement that Lorene has three times more pieces of stationery than Georgia.\nSince Lorene, having three times more pieces than Georgia has, is said to have three pieces in the statement, it means that Lorene has three pieces less than four times the number of pieces Georgia has.\nBy rewriting the above statement, you can see that:\n\n\\[L = 3 \\times G - \\frac{4 \\times G}{3} = 3 \\times (G - \\frac{G}{3}) \\implies G - G/3 = 3 \\times \\frac{G}{4} = 3 \\cdot 75 = 225\\]\n\nWhen you divide both sides of the equation by 3, you get:\n\n\\[G = \\frac{225 \\times 3}{3} = \\frac{750 \\times 3}{1} \\implies G = 250\\]\n\nTherefore, Georgia's stationery comes to 250.\n\n### Input\n\nGeorgia bought bananas and 8 other pieces of fruit, which is how many times as many as the bananas?\n\nOutput:\n\nGeorgia's fruit collection consists of 9 pieces of fruit, i.e. 9 times as many as the number of bananas Georgia bought.\n\n### Response\n\nAnswer:\n\nGeorgina's fruit collection consists 9 pieces of fruit.\n\nGeorgia has a total of 9 pieces of fruits.\n\n### Explanation\n\n\nThe way I approached this question was to try and figure out how much a banana costs and how many pieces of fruit I need to buy to get 9 pieces of fruites.\n\nSo let's go over what the question is asking: \"", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "If Ruth knows that well-cared dogs will live 2 years longer, on average, than hamsters live, and that hamsters live 2.5 years on average, how many years can a well-cared fish live? \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A dog's lifespan can be represented as two squares. A fish can be represented by a smaller square of radius 1 inside a larger square of radius 1. When one square is 4 times the size of another, the ratio of the area can be multiplied by 4, as two small squares are multiplied to form a square. For example, a square whose sides are 2 and 4 can be represented as a rectangle whose sides measure 2 and 8, which has an area of 16 square units.\n\nInput: Hamsters can be represented by a square whose sides are radius 0.5, and dogs can be represented by a rectangle with sides of radius 2. Fish can be represented by a triangle with a radius of 0.5.\n\nOutput: You can find the answer more easily if you think of each square as a region. For example, a rectangle can be thought of as a region that is surrounded by four squares of radii 1, 1, 2, and 2. A triangle can be thought of as three smaller regions - each with side length 0.5 units.\n\nOutput: Now, just multiply the number of times that each region is contained in the larger outer region. A dog's lifespans are represented by two square regions that are 4 times the size. Since dogs live two times as long as hamster's, each square has 1.6 times the area of the smaller square. The total area is multiplied by 4 - and when you divide by 2, the net result is that each square has an area of 2 times what it would if it were the same area. If each square was 2 times bigger, it's smaller side would be half the size of its longer side. When you multiply 0.5 from each square, the answer is 1. Thus, the larger outer region has a 1.6 times larger area than the smaller outer region, just as the lifespan of dogs is 2 times longer than the lifespan of hamsters.\n\nAnswer: 2.6 times longer.", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": "24:\n\n### Step-by-step:\nTo solve this problem you will need to know the volume of your box, the volume of your block and the formula for volume of a rectangular container.\n\nV = L * W * H\n\nFirst, since the box is square and has the same height, we'll say that it's volume is equal to 8 * 8 * 12 cm = 736 cm\n\nNow we want to figure out the volume of a block.\n\nBecause it's a building block and not a regular rectangular object, this is easier to figure out. Since it has 3 rectangular faces, we know that it's volume should be 3 * 2 * 4 = 24 cubic centimeters.\n\nFinally we can apply the formula for volume of rectangular containters to solve the problem. To do so we'll multiply the volume of our block (736cm) by the number we got for the volume of our box (24).\n\nSo the number we get should be 736 * 24= 17724\n\nSince 17728 is the number of block required, the correct answer should be 24.\n\n### \u200b\n\nInput: Where is the kitchen located if a door is near where?

This is because those choices do not mention any action the man did. The man only mentioned the bird. Choice: 4, How did the man feel that the bird died? is asking a question about how the man felt at that moment after his bird died. This is obvious because the man was not feeling that way when he noticed, and it is even possible that the man himself did not notice. All of these are different questions, and they are all asking about the bird and the bird's death, which the man talked about the bird and he did not. So all those choices can be eliminated. Lastly, Choice: 2 is asking about how the man noticed that the bird had died.

This question is asking where the person would prefer to go on an upcoming vacation, meaning that he is not limited to a single destination and can choose anywhere he wants.\n2. Among the given options, B and D involve spending a portion of the travel time in a specific location, and D includes only one spot, making them less attractive general choices for a vacation.\n3. B: travel refers to a time-consuming activity that is undertaken for one reason only- traveling to a destination.\n4. So all of the choices in B either have an activity as an answer (trail or walk), involve another travel-related activity (train or car) or a vacation-related one with a travel-related activity involved like a beach resort or a city with a travel-related destination involved.\n5. There are only two options that don't have an activity or travel related activity involved in them but one of those options is travel itself. \n6. So, the correct answer should be that the person is better off traveling to any destination of his choice instead of sticking with a specific location.\n7. Hence, we get B: travel.\n8. The person has also said that he can't think of any particular place they'd prefer to go on vacation, making C a wrong choice.

To serve 30 people we will need 30 potatoes and a teenspoon of salt, multiplying by 10 would give us a total of 50 potatoes and 350 teaspoons of salt. \n10. Because Susan will be serving two servings per meal, Susan will need one-half of the food required so 25 potatoes and 175 teaspoons of her recipe. \n11.

The question asks in which location a person would have the best opportunity to discover a store. 2. A person typically has the best opportunity to discover stores in a town or city. 3. In comparison, they would have a better opportunity to discover stores in smaller towns and rural areas, while in a rural town, or more likely, on the outskirsts of a town, a person could potentially discover few or no stores. 4. Therefore, the only suitable choices for the answer are C: at the center, D: in a rural area, E: near the edge. 5.

IX: I will do something I have never before. X: I will try to catch a fish.\nRationales: First off, the question asks which of the given statements is a hypothesis test.\n2. A hypothesis is a statement made before or during an experiment that predicts (or hypothesizes) the result of the experiment.\n3. Among the given statements, we can see that only statements III, VI, and X are related to an experiment (the others are statements of opinion, experience, etc.). \n4. Among the remaining options that are based on experiments, statements III and VI can be considered hypotheses.\n5. For hypothesis III, the hypothesis states that \"fish do not love cats\". In other words, \"cat's won't eat fish\". This is an experimentable hypothesis because both cats and fish can be tested to determine the true relationship between the two.\n6. For hypothesis VI, the hypothesis states that I have already tried a \"fishing pole out of a window and a hook into the lake next to my house\". This experiment is testable because one can try experimentally through a hypothesis test.\n7. Since both options III and VI can be experimented, therefore, they are hypotheses.\n8. Options IV and V, although related to a hypothesis in concept, do not indicate whether the hypothesis will be tested at any point during the experiment.

To understand this, we must first identify the criteria that the question is asking for. In this case, it is asking us to find the maximum number of people who can be either one of these things. \n\nIn terms of solution, the question can be interpreted as follows. There can be a maximum of three musicians who could potentially be actors. That is because each actor can only be in a group consisting of one or more musicians and a maximum of two actors.\n\nThere can be a maximum of six actors, who could potentially be in a group consisting only of either one or two actors and a maximum of three muscians.\n\nAs such, in this scenario, there are a maximum of three musicians (one, two, or three) who could potentially be actors, and there are a maximum of six actors (one, two, of three musicians) who could potentially be musicians.\n\nWe will now consider the various options, eliminating those as we see them.\n\nOption A: Musicians and Actors have more options for combination than musicians and actors have.

They are usually not seen in large numbers, and they are protected because they have been in Japan for a long time. Many chestnut trees have large, broad trunks and wide", "answer": " 130"}

Choices:  when you feel like it, when you have a question, when you can't find a comma for it, when you're in the mood, when you can\nRationales:1. When reading the question, it makes sense that 'when should we use a comma' has to do with the comma usage rules. The comma usage rules specify when we should use a comma and when to not use it. It's not a simple question of usage, we should check whether to use a comma or not. 2. Therefore, we can understand this as a question about comma usage. 3. The correct options here refer to specific rules about comma usage.\n4. Option A: when you feel like it: This refers to a time that is not specific or measurable. It's a general rule, not a question about comma usage when it comes to a particular punctuation mark. 5. Option B: when you have a question: This indicates a time that is based on whether you are asking a related question at that moment. It's not about comma usage. 6. Option C: when you can't: This refers to a lack of options to choose from. So it's not about comma use. 7. Option D: when you're in mood: This is also an inappropriate option as it's about a feeling or a state of mind, not about comma usage. It's based on a situation that is related to a particular comma usage. 8. Option E: when you can: This is the only correct option here. It refers to a time when you actually use a specific punctuation mark in a particular sentence. By using this, you can understand when you need to use a comma. The choice indicates that comma usage has to be measured, based on time, because it's in a particular situation.  9.

Here you must follow what it says. If it said 5 koala is less than kangaroos then you must do the subtraction and not the division.\n4.

The total number of cupcakes that Jessa needs to make is 170.\n\n### Input When you are doing something you want to go out the door and go to the kitchen.\n\n### Rationales (Intermediate Reasoning)\n\n1. The phrase \"out the door,\" is an idiom that means \"to complete something.\"\n2. The phrase refers to going from one task to the next, as if you were going out the door to head to the kitchen.\n3. A kitchen is often used for storing food, so an example sentence would be \"I finished making dinner and I'm out the door and going to the kitchen to get the food.\"\n4. In our example sentence, we might say, \"I'm out of the door, going to the kitchen, and getting more food.\"\n5. To \"go to the kitchen\" means to go into another room or portion of the house where the kitchen is located.\n6. The kitchen typically refers to the room in the home that is used for storing and preparing food.\n7. Therefore, the entire sentence describes a situation where someone does one task (making dinner) and then moves on to the next task (getting more food in the kitchen).\n8. The first task would be done when the person leaves the kitchen and walks out the door.\n9. The next task describes the action of going to the kitchen to do the next task, which is getting more food.\n10. Therefore the answer is C: to get more food.\nAnswer: C: to get more\n\n### Input What will you see when it comes to clouds?\n\n### RT: When it comes to clouds, you will see various types, including cirrus, stratus, and cumulonimbus, which are often associated with different weather conditions, such as rain, snow, or thunderstorms.\n\n### Answer:  C\n\n#### Instruction/Demonstration: Input: At the bottom of the well, the man was forced to lie in the dirt.

{"text": "The combined total number of mews\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Start off with each cat that was meowing 3 times in a minute. \n2. The question is asking for the grand total and not a sum of each cat.\n3. There is no mention of the interval in the question, so divide it by 5 if you were wondering.\n4. So we start with 3 cats, each 3 times per minute, which comes out to 9 every minute and 45 in 5 minutes. \n5. Divide 45 by 3, and then you will have the answer. \n6. In order to answer, I added the three meow timings and got 9 times per minute, which is multiplied by 5 to get 45 meow sounds every minute, and then get 45/3 which come out to 15 cats.\n\n### Response 2:The combined total meow sounds\n\n### Rationale:\n 1. The question was asking for the meow sounds of 3 cats, not the total meow sounds.\n 2. Since the question had mentioned that the first cat meowed 1x for every meow of the second cat, and the second cat meowed 2x for every meow, for the 3rd cat. \n 3. The total number of meows that the 3rd cat makes will be (1/3) times the number of meows from the 2nd cat.\n 4. If the last cat meowed (1/6th) as frequent as the second cat for every meow, than that would mean the last cat would be 5 times less.\n 5. And because it says 5 minutes, the first cat meows 7 times. The second cat meows 14 times. And the third cat meows 5 times.\n 6. Total meows of 26 each minute. Divide each minute by 5 to get the total meow sounds for 5 minutes in total.\n 7. 26/5 comes out to be 5.2 for a total of 5 meow sounds for 10 minutes. Subtract 4.5 to get the 3rd cats meow sound.\n 8. First cat comes out to be 1.", "answer": " 55"}

{"text": "The poultry farm originally had approximately 300 chicken, 200turkey,80 guinea foul. After a week, the total is reduced to 20+5-8, the total is 7, which shows that 20+5=7. The farm still has both chicken and guinea fowl.\n\n### Incorrect answer:1. The poultry farm originall had approximately 303 chicken, 220 turkey, 80 guinea. The total is reduced to 400+5-80, the number is 43. The farm still has 400+220 chicken in the poultry. \n\n### Explanation:For this, the answer requires understanding exactly how much each farm has. \n\nThe original total is 303(chicken) + 220(turkey) + 80(guinea). After 1 week, the total is 20+5+7. Therefore, after 1 week, how many birds are left is 20+7 =27 birds total. To answer correctly, you need to correctly calculate the number of birds the original poultry farm, which we can do by subtracting how many birds were lost each day. From the statement, we know that 20+8+5. Here, 20+8 is the day before when the total was 300+200+80, but the next day, we lose 20(chicken), so the day changes to 200+8, then in the statement, that day lost guinea fowl(5) and lost turkey(8). From the statement, so far it is 200+5 so that leaves only 20 guinea fowl alive in the poultry farm after day 5. So far, the loss is 200, so after the 6th day, there will only be 200 birds left. The next day, 20+5 birds die, another 5 bird died, and 8 bird died. Again, after the 8th day, we only lost 8 birds. After the 9th day, the total is 300, so the poultry is still", "answer": " 349"}

{"text": "$80\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. In any given group of numbers, there is always a number that is common to the entire set.\n2. To find this number, we simply need to determine the largest possible number in the group we can subtract from the total sum.\n3. In this case, the total sum is $300. The largest possible number in this group is 100, so the greatest number we can subtract from $300 is 100.\n4. We then need to subtract 100 from 300 and find the remainder. In this case, it is only $20.\n5. Adding the remainder to the original total gives us the change that Mary has left, which is just $20.\n6. To check the original answer, Mary can then add the $20 from the party's original total to her remaining $200 to find that she has $220 in total.\n7. Since $220 is less than $300, Mary can verify that she should have $80 in change.\n\n### Input:$A$ is a positive integer. $B$ is greater than $A$ and greater than $5$. Do $A>B$, or $B>A$?

In other words, the numbers don't mean anything by itself. It's just a placeholder. The question is, how many hours of volunteering would you do per year if you volunteered, twice a month (every 4 weeks) for 3 hours in your 31 hours of the month?\n\nIt comes down to multiplying every month's number times the number of months.\n\n### For example:\n### If a person volunteers at a shelter two hours every month, for a total of 76 hours per year. \n### What happens if they volunteer four hours every month for 8 months?\n\n### What is the total number of hours they volunteer in one year, assuming the person does this activity once a month for at least 8 months a year?\n\n## The answer is 120 hours (37.5 x 3).

Multiplying the number of hours (30) with the number of months (2) raises the power to 2, producing 30 x 2 = 60, and multiplying this with 3 months of volunteering (3 x 3 = 9) produces a total of 60 x 9 = 540 hours. Hence the final answer is 540, or 210 hours in one year.\n### In the algebraic version, there is a \"1\" because of the one \"month\" (60 x 1 = 60) in the very first part of the equation.\n\n### The algebraic version is preferred", "answer": " 72"}
{"text": "Jessica pays $200 each month for car insurance, $10,400 for rent, and $18,600 for food in a year. This year, her expenses are: $20,800 for rent, with an additional $300, $2,400 for food, with an additional $6,000, and $24,900 for car insruance, with an additional $21,900.\n\n### Rationale:\n###  1. The question starts by asking how much more Jessica pays for her expenses over a year. This requires us to compare how much she pays for her expenses in one year to how much she paid in the previous year.\n###  2. The question lists three things that went up last year, in comparison to this year: her rent, food, and car insurance. We know this but we're not sure how much these three things went up. The information given is the percentage increase.\n###  3. So, we need to work with the percentages given and figure out how much Jessica spends for these in the new year.\n### \n###  4. The question also indicates that rent, food, and insurance costs went up 30%, 50%, and 200%, respectively.\n###  5. We multiply the percentages with the expenses she paid last year in the original question. So, for rent we take 30% x $8,400 = $2,520, for food we take 50% of $1,800 = $900, and for insurance we take 200% of $100 = $200...etc. This gives us: $2,528, $900, $200, $24,610, $6,003 etc, which forms the response above. This tells us that Jessica spends $2,529 more for her rent, $903 more for food, $209.38 more for car insurance, and a total of $32,620.38 more over the year compared to last year.\n### Rationale for the answer:\n###  6", "answer": " 7200"}

The question here is \"What is a person's favourite type of exercise?\" So, we know we need to select one answer that corresponds to a personal preference. There's a lot of detail in this question, but that doesn't necessarily mean there is room to select multiple answers. As there are only a few pieces of detailed information, and the question poses the question in the present simple (not the present continuous or present perfect), we can safely assume that the only thing we can really know about the preferred form of exercise is that this is currently the person's favourite activity.\n2. Looking at the options, we notice that all the answers refer to physical exercise that involves moving the body, with the exception of E: Pulling weights. It could be reasonable to assume that for a person to identify pulling weights as their favourite exercise, they may perhaps also be the only form of exercise they do, or at least their only preferred way of exercising. But we can't really tell that for certain from the context. We are just looking for the one form of exercise that would most likely currently be the person's favourites, since we only know that from context alone.\n3. If the person does prefer to engage in multiple forms of exercise, then in a similar manner, we can eliminate D: swimming. If a person was currently using swimming as their main way of exercising, then they probably wouldn't consider it to be a favourite but rather a non-negotiable necessity. If they were currently choosing to swim, they may be prioritising other forms of exercise as their favourites. That leaves us with 1: Running, 2: Biking, 3: Jogging, and 4: Yoga.

{"text": "65 pills remain in the bottle.\n\n### Reason:The question is fairly straightforward, asking how many pills remain in the original bottle of 5*26 = 130 pills.\n\nThere are 9 days, each involving 2 doses per day with 3 days at 1/2 doses per day.\n\nSo, we need to arrange these steps in a logical order.\n\n3/2+3/2+3(1/2)+1/2=5\n\n3/3(2/2+1)+(1/2+1+1/2) = 5\n\n3/2 = 1.5\n\n1 and 1/2 (2/2 = 1)\n\n+ 2 and 3/2 (7/6 = 1.1666666....)\n\nNow, add 1 and 1/3, which totals to 2\n\nIn other words, we could say 1/3 of the days were at single doses, and we need to add that.\n\nThis is because for the first day to the third day, he is using two pills twice a day. On the fifth day, he stops taking the 2 pills twice a day, but continues to use 1 1/2 pills twice a week.\n\nWe can use this to help solve for the following question, where the math becomes a little more complicated.\n\n**Answer Options: 3.75 pills.**\n\nThe question is asking how many extra painkillers they will need. First, subtract 130 (the number of pills they initially took home, as explained in the question) from 172 (the number of pils they will need.)\n\nThis gives us 42 pills left over, but this isn't enough to account for the five days they take two pills each.\n\nNext, we must add the 3.75 extra pills, totaling 46.75 pills left to divide over the last three days.\n\nBut why does he divide them? After going from 3/2 doses to 1 pills to 1/2 pils to 2 pils again, he wants to cut back the dose to one pill to reduce the risk", "answer": " 27"}
{"text": "$80 for 1 piece\n\n### Reasoning : \n1. 3 pieces for each pie means that they have 33 pies or 11 pies * 3.00 = 30 pies. \n2. It takes 1 hour to make 12 pie because 12/3 = 4, which indicates that each bakery can sell 11 pies.\n3. 12/4 = 3, so each bakery can make three pie and 11*7 = 77 pie which is sold out every day \n4. The total cost of all pies = $60 $0.5.\nTherefore, the total profit for 1 piece = $4-0.5= $3.5.\n5. If you multiply $3.5 X 11 = 38.5, and 11/3 = 3.75. \n$38.5/3.75 = 10.4 pies or 10.4 pieces you have to sell for $80\n6. $80 X 3.75/10.4 = 12.25,\n8. $100 X.5 = 50$, and 50 + 50 = 100\n\n### Instructions:Rewrite the sentence to avoid unnecessary repetitions.

Once the ball hits the ground, the force of gravity is no longer acting on the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n[This is the next problem]:\nIn order to find the answer to this question, it is important to first understand the meaning of the word \"affect.\" \"Affect\" in this context means \"to exert a causal or influential effect on.\" In this case, the force of gravity on a ball that is thrown in the air exerts a causal or influent effect on the trajectory of the ball through the air. Gravity continues affecting the force of the ball every time it falls back toward Earth as it loses energy and moves back down toward the ground. Gravity affects the ball indefinitely until it finally hits the ground and stops moving through the air. Therefore, the answer to this question is that gravity affects the force of a ball that is thrown into the air indefinitely.\n\n\n\nInput: Which statement is correct: water and fish oil are a way of gaining omega 3's from fish or fish are a way of gainning omega 3'? \n\nRationales:A: water and fish oil can be a way of gaining Omega 3s from fish (by consuming the oil or mixing the oil with water). \nB: fish is a way of gaining the Omega 3 from fish. \n \nInput: If an equation has a 5 and when multiplied by a 4, the result is 1, then the value of the 5 is? \n\nRationale:The value of the 5 must be 10 when multiplied by a number 4 to produce the result 1.\n\n\n\n[Input: If an equation is 3x plus 2 then 15-5 and when 16", "answer": " 90"}

If x is the number of diaries, she starts with 4 diaries, buys 8 more, and ends up with 11. She lost 1 of those 4, so she now has 3. She bought a total of 12 more diaries, so that's +3 = 15. To get these figures, simply add a negative 1, which is her lost diary, to the number of diaries bought.\n\n2. Let's denote the total number of diaries as X. Since the sister had 8 small ones in the locker last summer, she bought a total of 8 diaries in the summer, so she begins with X = 8. She then bought a total of 20 diaries in the first round, (8 + 20), so we can write (8 X) + 20 = X + 20. We replace the X with (8 X), and (8 X) + (8 1/4) = 8(X + 1/4). In the end, we get: (8 X + 20) = (8 X + 8 1/4). If subtract 20 from both sides, we get (X + 1/2) = 8. For X = +1, X X is 2. So she has 11 diaries.\n\n3. Since she started with X, she bought 12 diaries more, ending up with X = 11 in the locker.\n\n## 2.\nRationales 1. First, let's see what all the given values and operations represent.

{"text": "The roadwork company needs to use 288 barrels of pitch for their remaining road on the third and final day. \n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. It takes three trunks to make each mile of road pave.\n\n2. One mile of road takes two bags of grain and five barrels of pitch.\n\n3. From this we can get that the truck paved 390 miles of road, 24,300 barrels of pitch, 1,200 bags of granite, 12,000 barrels, and 6,000 truckloads.\n\n4. We can now subtract the first day's road work: 390 miles - 4 miles = 386 miles\n\n5. Also we can subtract the second day's road work is 386 miles - 4 miles - 12,630 barrels of gravel is 12,266 barrels of grain.\n\n6. So, to finish with remaining road 386 -12,264 barrels of grains is 26,640 barrels of granite.\n\n7.

One would not store shoes in a hall tree either as it's designed to hang up clothes and not shoes. \n3. If there's a box that's big enough to fit shoes, and it can be kept in either the bedroom or family room space, it should go under \"Other\" in the list of choices. \n4.

Statements like \"I like pineappls\" that lack reasoning is an example of \"non-valid logic\" because it is impossible to deduce from the statements alone whether they refer to validity or not. On the other hand, \"I like pizza\" is an example of \"valid logic\" because it includes at least one premise that can be used to infer to a conclusion based on the rules of valid logic. The statement \"I like pizza\", with or without premises is therefore an expression of \"logical reasoning\"", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": "14 grandchildren.\n\nInput: What animal does an elephant never eat? Choices:  M: cheetah C: hippo E: mouse A: giraffe\nRationales: First, we can immediately eliminate options C: Hippo and D: giraffe, as these both belong to the African animal species.\n\n1. Option E: Mouse has never been eaten by elephants, but it is still a small rodent so it is not very likely that an elephant would eat a mouse.\n\n2. So it only leaves us with options B: Cheetah and M: cheetah.\nAfter some clarity on our reasoning, we should be able to rule out option A: Giraffe.\nSince the other animals are also in the African animal species, it would make sense to include this animal in the answer.\n\n3. Since both B: Cheetahs and C: Hippos both belong to the African Animal species, our rule out A: giraffe means that they can both only be animals that don\u2019t eat giraffes.\n4.

{"text": "Bert's golden retrievers full adult weight, in lbs  = 514lbs\n\n### Demostration:\nTo begin interpreting this answer, it is important to first understand the context of the question. The question is asking for the full adult weight of Bert's golden retrIEVER, not just the weight of the dog. This can be discerned from the last few questions of the sequence. The question, \"How many ounces is 2 sticks of butter?\" is preceded by \"If a gallon of water weighs 8.34 lbs, how much does 2 pounds weigh in gallons?\"\n\nTo begin interpreting the answer, we can see that the 1st, 3rd, and 5th numbers in this sequence represent the weight of the pet at a certain age. These weights are represented as whole numbers, meaning they are not decimals. This makes sense, as the numbers only represent whole weight, in pounds. For example, we would not expect the dog to weigh 17.88 pounds when it is 7 weeks old, or 41.68 pounds when it is at 1 year old.\n\nFrom this information, we can assume that the dog's final adult weight is equal to the third number in the sequence, the one representing the weight of the dog when it is 3 months old. This was 78 pounds.\n\nDividing this number by 2 gives us 39, which is the dog's expected weight when it is one year old. Multiplying this number by 3 gives us, 117 pounds, which is the final adult weight of the dog. \n\nRationales:\n1. First of all, we can simply identify the answer of 117 as the final adult weight of Bert' s golden retriever.\n2. We know from looking at the sequence of consecutive whole numbers that the dog's weight increases with each question.\n3. We can see that the numbers represent the dog's weight at 0/7 weeks old, 3/9 months old, and 0/5 years old. From this we can discern that the dog ends up at a full adult weight once it is at it 0/1-year weight. This matches the pattern seen in 03/09.", "answer": " 78"}

Both sports are played outside, but soccer is more of a rough sport and is played by many players while you might use one ball to play soccer but you could use a few to play tennis.\n3. It also depends on what is your purpose in playing these sports.\n4. For soccer, it might be rough but because of its popularity, if you play you won't earn a lot of money. Also, if you are a beginner or a professional, you don't need to play in a Stadium. \n5.

{"text": "A: 1 week\n\n### Rationale:First, let's take a look at the definition of fission: it is the splitting of a cell into two identical daughter cells. Now, we can apply the logic to the above question. There are 2 amoebae, let's call them Parent and Offspring. Parent takes 2 days to reproduce, resulting in 4 amoebae in total. From the question, we know that Parent has reproduced every 2 days for a week, meaning that it has gone through 7 cycles of reproduction, which can be written as P0, P2, P4, P6, etc. where Pi is the 'ith' child. As a result, the grandparent and grandchild would be Offspring, which takes us to Offspring 1.0.\n\nNow, let's see how many more days it'll take for the cycle to complete. According to the definition of fission, Parent will split into 2 daughter cells that are offspring of it. As a result, offspring 1.0 to 1.0 + 1 split into 2 each (10 amoebae total) for the next generation. Similarly, each generation has 10 amoeba which in total gives us 1016 amoeba. After 7 generations, it is obvious that we need to add another 7 to it, giving us 1023 or approximately 1024. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A, which is 1 week.\n\n### Input::The teacher told the student to put 4 cups down so the ratios add up to two-thirds.

Now with the 6 inch rulers, the price is $(1.5 \\times 12) / 6 = 50 cents$, and so the total cost is $1.50 + \\frac{50}{12} = 1.88$\n\n### Explanations: The explanation on the left hand side of the screen includes what the question is, why it is a good question, and what to look for to decide how to answer the questions. The explanation on the right hand side includes what they are doing to find the answer, why they are doing what they are, and whether or not what they are doing is the most effective way to find the answer.\n\n### Answer: The solution to this question is, that the 6 inch inch rulers cost $1.88$.\n\n### Grade 5 Writing Rules\n### Input: Write each number", "answer": " 2934"}
{"text": "Demostion:\nInput: Yasna has two books, one at 180 pages and the other at 100 pages.\nRationales: The question asked about the page number that Yasna needs to read if she wants to finish the books in two weeks time. Let's consider the length and number of books and the time (two weeks) to arrive at the answer. We also consider the requirement that Yasna wants to read an equal number of pages every day. So, let us break up the problem in the below way:\nNumber of pages to read per day = Number of pages of the book/ Number of days per week\nAssuming Yasna read the pages every day during the week (12 days a week).\nTotal Pages to read for two weeks = 2*180 + 2*100 = 2100\nTotal no. of weeks = 12 \u2013 as Yasna will take less time to read the first book and more time to read the second book\nThe remaining part of the problem can be solved by rewriting the above in terms of math: 121/2 * 180 = Reading pages for 1 day 2*121 * 180/2 = Reading pages for 2 days 53/2 * 100 = Reading pages for all the remaining days (days after 1 week and before 2 weeks)\nAs one day is equivalent to 180 pages, two days equal to 2*181 pages, and the remaining 19 days equal to 19*100 pages. The total number of pages to complete the two books in 2 weeks is 2100 \u2013 100 (remaining pages). As 100 pages can\u2019t be evenly divided among 21 days, we end up short by 4 pages.

{"text": "He sold 24 kg(15 + 8) of vegetables. In particular, it was 8 kg of brocoli, 15 kg of Carrots and 8 of Zucchini.\n\n### Rationales: 1)You will need to identify how much carrots, zucchini, and broccoli that the seller has. Since we have stated that he or she sold only half of them, we know that half of the total amount of carrots = 8 kg, half of the total amount zucchini = 7 kg, half of the broccoli =.4 kg. (If you did not know how to do the math, just do the multiplication. It\u2019s half of 13 kg or 15 kg. 100x the number =.5) 2) Since I wrote a sentence instead of providing a fraction, I will explain by replacing a fraction with a decimal. So: 15kg =.4,.4 =.4/1,.4=.4 * 1,.4=4/10, 4/10=4/10 * 1, 4=40, 40=.4 *, 40=.3921575 * 100, 40=40 * 100. 3) 3) Then the merchant sold 8kg of broccoli 4) Then we know from the equation.4=40 that 4/10 = 8/1, 8/1 = 8/10. We know now that 8kg would be 8/10 kg of broccoli =.8kg 5) Then we know that 24kg of vegetables are the total mass of broccoli, carrots, and zucchini. This is because we sold.8 kg of broccolo and have 23.2 kg of vegetables(15+13+8=35/23.2=1.4952941x10^2 =1495 grams per kilogram)\n\n\n### Input : A man walked 12m south, 9m north, and 6m west.

Be able to break down the task into smaller parts and identify key issues to be addressed in the response.\nRationale: In the first question, you need to divide the question into its components. Firstly, the salad contains 30 calories of lettuces, 110 caleries of cucumbers and 240 caleries of croutons. Let us suppose x represents the calories of salad = 30 + 80 + 12(20) = 240. Let us divide the salad into 6 parts. If we assume x represents any one of the 6 parts then, x calories comes from lettuce part out of total lettuce contained in the salad, but x is not a whole lettuce if it contains 6 lettuce. The same applies for cucumber and crouton. So if we calculate every number of the six parts then the answers will be like following: First Part: Let us divide one part of lettuce to get x, so 30/6 comes as x. Lettuce x comes in one part only and x comes again as lettuce that means no lettuce for the second part only 1 cucumber and no lettuce but 1 more cucumber for the 3rd part and 1 cucumber,", "answer": " 350"}

{"text": "75\n\n### Rationale: Intermediate Explanation Steps:\n\n#### 1. Understand the Question\n\n1. First, it's important to understand the question.\n\n2. This question asks about the amount of money that the class was able to gather together.\n\n3. The way the question is worded suggests that the students each paid $50, but that some of them paid a smaller amount.\n\n4. To answer this question, it's important that we use the mathematical process of simplification.\n\n#### 2. Simplify & Use the Given Information\n\n1. First we start by simplifying the information.\n\n2. The key is to understand that the students paid a total of $100, with 4 of them paying $25.\n\n3. We also know that there are 25 total students, which means that there are 21 students that paid $50.\n\n4. We can simplify this information by converting every amount into actual numbers.\n\n5. All the amounts are given in dollars, so we can't convert them to a number without losing information.\n\n6. We can, however, convert the dollar amount of $50 into the base-10 representation for the number 50.\n\n7. This can be done by removing the dollar sign, and then splitting the number, 5, by the 0, with a zero left over.\n\n8. This also means that we then can convert the $25 amount by putting the symbol for twenty-five, 25, in place of the dollar sign.\n\n9. We can also convert $100 by splitting the number 100 by the zero. \n\n10. The only remaining number, 0, is converted by removing the dollar signs altogether.\n\n11. With our information simplified in this manner, there are now 5 numbers: 50, 100, 5, 25, 0.\n\n12. These numbers are our key to solving this puzzle, and we will refer to each of them as X, Y, Z, A, and B respectively.\n\n13. Now that we have our information simplified, we can use our process of elimination.\n\n#### 3. Find the Missing", "answer": " 1150"}
{"text": "Renovating a house takes around 18 hours on average.  It took Tom a total of about 41 hours to renovate the three bedrooms and kitchen and the living room twice takes more time than the kitchen.  To calculate the original time for each room and for the living room, we can use the following formula to determine the time and then add them up to get the total time. Total work time: T = original time for living room + 2 x original time for each bedroom.  Using this formula, the total original time for each bedrooms are B1 = 4 and B2 = 8.  The total original time for the living room is 4 + 2 x 4 since we will be doing this twice.

He buys 3 popsicles at $3.00 a piece.  He pays for the popsicles with a handful of quarters.

It\u2019s obvious that he has 4 quarters in his hand. \nHow many dimes does John have? \n\n#### Response\n\nJohn has three dimes\n\n6. The man pays two dimes, so John buys one popsicle with 80 cents, then one man meets Mr. Ice cream and sells him a pencil for a quarter, then he goes to another ice cream and buys some ice cream for a quarter (a nickel), and then he goes to a newspaper store and buys 6 newspapers with 2 dimes = 24 cents, and the cost of the pencil is 25 cents, therefore John has 3 dimes\n7. $3.00 + $0.25 = $3.25\n8. $3.25 - 0.25 (pencil) - 0.5 (a popsicle) = $2.50\n9 $2.50 - $2.00 (four quarters) = $0.50\n10. $3.26 - $2.37 (12 dimes) = 0.89\n11. $0.89 - $0.50 (", "answer": " 131"}

Choices: A: looking for a screw to screw B: looking for another tool C: planning what to build D: repairing something E: building something\nRationales: First, we ask ourselves what this man would be doing with regard to the hammer he has in his hand. \n1. A: looking for a tool to use with it. This would suggest he is repairing or building something. \n2. B: looking for another hammer. This option does not correspond to the given context. The context involves a man who could be doing any number of things with a hammer while he has it in hand. So, this is eliminated.\n3. C: planning what to do with the hammer. This does not reflect the idea of using the hammer with other things, so we can eliminate this option.  \n4. D: repairing the hammer. This option is out of scope with the context. Repairing involves restoring something to a functional or original state or fixing damage or wear and tear of that thing. \n5. This idea is incompatible with the present context since the hammer is said to be in the man's hand, suggesting it is in a functional state and possibly not in need of repair.\n6.

Choices: \n\n54 + b = a, Choices: \n54 + a = b, Choices: 54+b=a\nRationales:\n\n1. First, the questions asks us to select a number between 0 and 53 to add to 54.\n2. We start by making sure the number does not already include the sum (54).\n3. We know 54+a=b, but we don't know what b is because we don't know the exact value of a. \n4. So, we add 54 to any number.\n5. We then subtract b from that sum. \n6. In this example b=7. \n7. Therefore, A: 54+a=(7+54), B: 54+n=6 and C: the number is 5. \n8.

It could refer to any particular plane, or it could refer to all planes. However, given as an instruction, one would take the word to refer to every plane.\n2.  The number of gallon per mile increases if there are passengers or crew members, but doesn't increases if there are bags. This means it works for every passenger (or crew) and there are no bags.\n3. Every passenger is adding 3 gallons to the total. For every additional passenger, the extra gallon of fuel is added to the total. For example, if there 3 passengers, they need 6 gallons per mile.\n4. Every additional bag brings in 2 gallons of extra fuel. If someone brings one bag, they would need an extra 4 gallons; if they bring two bags, they would need three extra gallons, and so on.\n5. The empty plane requires 20 gallons for a mile. So, 20 gallons per mile is subtracted. This means it would first add 20 gallons.\n6. For every passenger, it adds 3 gallons for every person. Adding 20 gallons brings it to 311 gallon of fuel needed for the 401-mile trip.\n7. For every passenger, we need to multiply with its coefficient.

So, if bucket A has exactly 12 pies of fruit, bucket B has exactly 11 pieces of fruit, and bucket C has exactly 8 pieces of fruit, this total of 26 pieces of food fits what we know to be the case.\n8.

{"text": "The answer to this is D: $27.\n\n### Rationales: 1) The question is asking how much it costs to plant one flower and 2) we must first determine what the unit cost for the different components is, and 3) once we know the unit cost of the clay pot and bag of soil, we need to just calculate the total cost that it would take to buy these components.\n\n### Step 1: Determine the unit costs of each of the components\n\n1. The flower cost $9, which means in this context, it means the cost for 1 flower.\n2. The clay pot cost $20 more than a flower, or $30. This could be interpreted as the cost of 1 pot, since 30 is 20 more than 10, which would make sense if the question says how much it costs to have 1 clay pot, and the clay pot contains a flower.\n3. However, it could be interpreted as the price of 2 pot (and 1 flower), since 30 is $10 more expensive than the $20 of 1 pot, which is equivalent to buying the pot and having an extra flower. \n4. So, we interpret the question as $30 being the price of 1 clay pot (and 1 additional flower) and we will use this latter interpretation in following steps.\n5. The bag of soil cost $2 less than the clay pot. So instead of $20, we subtract $2 to get $18.\n6. Therefore we should think of the bag of soil as $18.\n\n### So far: the flower is $9, a clay pot that contains the flower is $30 and a bag of soil costs $18.\nHow do we make the total flower + soil + pot cost $27?\n\n### Step\n\n### 2a: How much does it cost for 1 flower?\n\nWe can see that the flower costs 9 dollars, so the total cost of 1 flower is $9. This will be our answer to this question.\n\n## Step\n\n## 2b: How much does it the pot cost for 2 flowers and a bag of soil?\n\nWe can calculate this based on the unit prices: the soil costs $18", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "Answer: 5\n\n### Justification:\nLet's take stock of our information first. We know that there 8 parrots in the zoo. We know that there are fewer than 8 zebras in the zoo, since the total number of zebras is two fewer than the total number of monkeys. We also know that the zoo has twice as many elephants as snakes, so there are 8 elephants plus 2 snakes.\n\nNow it does get a little trickier. We know that there is an equation involving the parrots and the snakes, and the snakes plus the monkeys is equal to the elephants. That means there is probably an equation involving the parrotes and the monkeys as well, or we'd be missing something important.\n\nThe next step is to figure out the variable. I like to think about it this way: the sum of the monkeys and the parrots will always equal a constant. The monkeys are at one end of the equation with the parrots at the other. I don't know the constant in order to do substitution or elimination, but this can be a step for working backwards if you have a clue of what the constant is or can be calculated.\n\nThe sum of the elephants and the snake will never be equal to another constant.\n\nWith that being said, I suspect that the variable is the parrot number, since when we substitute parrots for variable, we get a variable that is a constant, and when we substitute the other variables, the sum of the number of elephants and snakes will never equal a constant if these numbers are used as variables.\n\n\n\nLet's do substitution first. The question tells us that we have to solve for X. Substituting X for parrots gives as a constant, where x = 8. We can then solve that equation and find 21. The other side of the equation is the parrot number.\n\nNow let's do elimination. The snakes are half the monkeys, so we can eliminate that. The other side of that is the number of parroths minus the number of snakes. The question tells us tha snakes is twice the number of monkeys, so we now know that the number of parrohts plus the number of monkeys is half of eleph", "answer": " 35"}

Keep all these pointers in mind while you rephrase the entire question and make sure the new question you construct is clear and coherent.\n\n### In the second step, you need to look at all possible options and see if any of them makes sense. To do this, you can repeat the whole sentence several times, changing only the options, to see how it changes the meaning. You need to ensure the original question is clearly solved by the options.\n\n1. If one of your options make sense, you can cross it out.\n2. If you can't decide whether any option makes sense, you should repeat the question with different options.\n3. This will help eliminate options that make no sense.\n\n### If you need to get more help on this question or this type of question, try searching the internet for relevant sites and guides.

{"text": "Input: The cost of fertilizers and pesticals, how much does he spend?\n\n### Rationales:\n1. To find how much he spent on fertilizers and herbicides, we need to know what he spent on each of the two options. \n2. The question states that they are two different options that cost $35. \n3. Based on this, our only two options are $35 and $50.\n4. $35 and $45 are not two separate options, thus, we must choose the one option.\n5. Therefore we choose our option to be the one which is higher than the $35 option.\n6. The only option that is higher than $35 is $50, so we take $50.\n7. Using this, we can say that the cost of fertilizers was $35.\n8. Now using this we can say that the sum of all expenditures is $90, as we also know that $50 are spent on fertilizers.\n9. Therefore $40 were spent on labor cost.\n10. Now knowing all this, the profit the farmer made is equal to $11.\n11.

Rationales: 1) \"When he cuts a slice\": Since he's \"cutting a slice\" to taste it, it clearly refers to something he's already completed, not a hypothetical slice.\n2) \"tastes awful\" is a past tense, as in \"it now tastes awful\" or \"from this point on, it tastes bad\". \n3) \"they taste it\" is the only option that works with the present tense and past tense usage.\nAnswer: A. They taste it\nAnswer:\n### Rationales:1. The man and the woman are looking at the cooking show. Presenters usually demonstrate preparing recipes on cooking shows.

{"text": "The builder used a total of 112 bolts and 84 nuts for the project.\n\n### Explain:The answer is found by examining four variables. First, we note that the builder obtained 3 boxes of bolts, each containing 11 bolths, for a grand total of 33 bolts. The nuts purchased were 3 boxes of nails, each containing 15 nails. This gives us 45 nuts. 6 days later, there would be 3 left over. 3+1+6 = 10, so 10 were taken. 7 is the number of boxes bought of bolts, so 10-7=3 left over. Next, let us consider one box of bolts. This box contained 11 bolts, so 33 \u00f7 11 = 3 bolts left over. This implies the question is now asking us how many bolts and what was left over for the project. We now know that, of the bolts bought, there are 26 used, and of the nuts bought, there are 11 used. We are asked how many are left over. 123-112=3 left over bolts and 82-84=2 left over nuts.\n\nReason: 2 of the 3 unused nuts came from the 7th box of nuts and 1 of the remaining 2 came from the 5th box.\n\n### Conclusion:", "answer": " 113"}

What is its shape?\n\n### Solution:\nWe can solve this question by setting up the question such that we can plug-in numbers. In this particular question, the shape is directly proportional to its weight, so we can set up an isometric equation of shape = weight/mass. Thus, our equation is $shape = \\frac{weight-20}{mass}$. By substitution, we get $mass = shape\\cdot\\frac{weight-24}{(weight-20)}$ and solving $mass$ and $weight-24$ we get $mass = 5kg$. \n\nThus, the answer to the problem is: The answer is a solid cube of a side length of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3}}$m. It's a bit counter intuitive since a cube will weigh twice that of the mass, so a solid cube won't float.

We know that three hours would be needed on the one-way trip since Paul went that long to get to the Nile Delt.\n2. On the return trip, Paul took the alligators to his home, therefore it's reasonable to assume that the trip to his home would take time. Paul is just as likely to have taken two hours to return home as he was to get to the Niley Delta.\n3. We cannot simply add the three and two together and assume both alligators took 5 hours.\n4.

{"text": "Option A. \n\n### Rationales:  \n\nThis question is set up like an infinite regress problem, essentially one where you ask a question about an equation in an equation. In questions like this, you should start by solving the equation (so, what's the number of invites?) and then use the answer to get the solution to that question (how many people attended the party?). \nThe solution is given: Ashley invited 20 of each of her friends and told each of her friends to invite one more person. Using this information, we know what the answer actually is and don't need to solve for the initial equation.\nNow we need to get the second equation: the total number of people. Let us assume that there was a total of 100 people: 20 invitees and an equal number of 2nd degree invitees. This gives us a new equation: The total number of people in Ashley's party = 20 + 2*(20). This can be simplified further, which gives: The total number of invitees = 40. \nNow we know that the total number of invitee guests can be 40. 20 invitee guests brought their original friends and another 20 friends who invited an invitee bringing the total number of people to an even 100, which gives us C: 100. Therefore, the answer to the second question is A (40) = C = 100 (even number of people) \nAnswer: A: 100\n\n### Input\nWhich number is the least? 288 312 139 48 62\n\n### Response\nChoice D : 48.\n\n### Rationale :\nThe first thing we need to do is to calculate what the least number is that can subtract from 288, 312, etc., and get a number divisible by 139 and 48.\nThis means multiplying 48 by 139, getting 6792. We subtract this by 288, which gets us the number 3894. Next, we do this operation for 312 and we get 4060. So we get 288 minus", "answer": " 31"}

{"text": "Anna was 19 when they got married.\n\n### Rationales:\nYou can work this out in two different ways. But first, let's try to find out Josh's age, and then Anna's age.\nThe answer is given as - 30y * 5 = Josh's (age when married) + Anna's age. Now, if we add 50 on both sides (30, 50 = 50, 100), we get 50 * 2 + Anna's age = Josh's age.\n\nAnother way to solve this: You should start with Josh's age and find Anna's age. The first statement is Josh and Anna were both born at Aug 17, 1983. Next statement is \"to consolidate celebrations\", Josh turned 22 and celebrated his birthday on Aug 17, for 22 years. Anna turned +19, and celebrated birthday on Aug 7, for 30 years.\n\nFor the third statement, if we consider Josh's age when he got married - 22y + Anna's age when she got married = 30 years. As we already know that Josh's age when married is 22, so the only way Anna's age when marreid can be 19 is if 5 years ago (when Josh was 17) and 5 years ago (Anna 14) their age was 22. So if we consider both Josh (17) and Anna (14) as teenagers, they would make out when they met, and became attracted to each other.

For the other 30 years, they celebrated Anna's birthday and Josh's birthday together, plus their 30 years of wedding anniversary.", "answer": " 28"}

You want to write down who asked which questions and the answers in chronological order as you take notes.\n\n### Question:How many total questions does each interviewer need to ask to interview everyone?\n\nAnswer: 45\n\n### Solution:Given\n```\nNumber of Jews interviewed = 10\nNumber of questions asked per interview = 2\nNumber of interviews per interviewe = 5\nTOTAL questions asked in interview = (2x10x5)  = 100 \n```\n```\nSince the questions asked in each interview are in the chronological order, each interviewer has to ask at least 2 questions in each of the first 5 interviews and at least 4 questions in each of the remaining 5 interviews. \nThere are 5 interviews in each interview session, so 5 interviews x 5 questions = 25 questions in each interview session. \nTotal number of questions asked in 5 sessions = 125 + 150 + 175 + 125 +100 = 675 questions\nTOTAL questions to interview 10 people = 100 + 100 = 200 questions\n```\n\nTherefore total number of questions asked in total = 675 - 200 = 475 questions\n```\nThere are 2 intertwined statements in which there is an implied relationship\n100+100=200\n125+150+125+175+125+0\n```\n```\nTherefore each interviewer needs to ask at least 4 questions each in the first 5 interviewer and at least 8 in the next", "answer": " 5"}

If you ask someone on the 1st floor how many items are on the entire floor and they tell you it is the same as on the 2nd floor, this would imply that there are no items at all on the 1st and 2nd floors, which would be odd. \n2.

Looking at choices B and C, to get an amount 2 or 4 (times) larger than the amount on the 2nd, you would need to account for every item from the 2nd floor. \n6.

Choices:  B: forward C: straight D: backward E: upwards\nRationales:\nThe question is asking which position (A or B, C or D or E) a rocket can travel at it's fastest speed.\n\nWe can start by eliminating any choice that can only apply to one answer. Hence, choose C or D or E (depending on whether the rocket is traveling faster while going up or down) should not be the answer, and we are left with the other 3. \n  (4. For the choice C: straight, the question is comparing traveling straight with forward, backwards, upwards and not backwards. In that case, forward is faster than straight and upwards, since they have the same speed but there is an upwards force acting on upwards. Hence D: backward should be eliminated too.)\n\n(5. For the choice E: upwards. We can say that the rocket will be traveling at its maximum velocity when it is at it's highest/highest/peak. Therefore, we can say that since the rocket will be at its peak, the velocity of which it will be traveling is maximum. As velocity is the speed with which the rocket moves along a given distance, it is safe to say that the velocity of the rocket travelling upwards at its highest is maximum. Consequently, there is no need to look at options D or E as choices for which choice has maximum velocity.

By looking at the equation, we see that there are two \" N's\" on the left hand side of the equation, so we know there are two N's. \n3. If we multiply the N left and get 6N, that means that N is the same as 6, therefore 6 n's = 36n. \n4.

Marvin sold 3 times the  number of  Marvin sold. Tina sold 35 Marvins sold. How much more money did tina make for the trip selling  candy bars compared to  Marvin?\n\nResponse: Tina made 40 more money for selling the trip Marvins made\n\n### Why:\n\nTo figure this answer, it's important to recognize that for each case we have the same quantity of candy bars. Marvin sold 20, and Tina sold 40. If we subtracted each quantity from Marvin's number, we would get 15 for Marvin and we would get 10 for Tina. Therefore our quantity will be 20 minus 15 is equal to 20 minus20. If we subtract 210 from 220, 10 will be the answer, and that is the number of candy bar.\n\n### Reasoning:\n\nFor each case, we have the same quantity and 30 each case. If we subtracted the quantity of Marvins case from the quantity of Tina's case we will get 30 minus 30, then the answer we get is the same number of candy bars. Since the quantity is 30, and the answer is the same number of 10, the answer is 10.\n\n### How to solve it:\n\nThe solution is straightforward:  we need to subtract the total number of candy bars sold by Marvin from the total number sold by Tina. This gives us the quantity of candy bars Tina needs to sell to make the same amount of money as Marvin (20 \u2013 15 = 5). Therefore, we can deduce that Tina sold three times more candy bars than Marvin, which would require her to sell 3 * 20 = 60 bars total. If Tina sells just 60 candy bars at $2 apiece, she would make $40 more for the class trip.\n\n### Additional information, and examples of how it's", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "You will first calculate for the number of tickets to purchase based on the provided information regarding ticket prices.\n\nThe number of tickets purchased is the total number of tickets after subtracting the value of the change that you are expected to receive.\n\nSince the required answer is in the form of change, we are going to calculate for the excess of the total cost over the number of tickets purchased.\n\nThe excess amount can be used to buy the required change. \n\nSince the child is younger than 12, there should be a discount per child. Therefore, the total price for the two tickets should be less by $2.\n\nThen, subtract the change from the total, and you should end up with 2. \n\nThis means that they will receive 2 dollars as change.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The solution first begins by calculating for the number of tickes based on the given information about the adult and children price.\n2. The calculation for this is given by the simplified formula of the total tickets purchased = $109 - x, where x is the value of change. \n3. A value of change of $2 will yield an excess value of $8 for each ticket. \n4. This shows that the total cost is $180. \n5. To know what number of tickets the family has available, this number is calculated by subtracting the excess from the total cost.\n6. If the total price for the tickets is $184, this means that they only have 4 more tickets to make this amount equal to the tickts required, so they would need to exchange 4 more tickets or 1 less ticket.\n7. This then allows them to adjust for a discount that the children can have for being underaged.\n8. Subtracting this value of $2 from the original cost, yields a difference of $5 in the purchase price. \n9. The adult ticket will remain unaffected, and the children ticket price will receive the discount for being children, where the total cost for the two tickets after discount is $96.\n10. This means that the required change in this question is the value of the additional cost for the tickets after discount.", "answer": " 74"}

Let us also say that each day Jerome rides, he does 2.5 more miles than he has to. \nSo Jerome is planning to ride 12 times, and each day he rides 12 miles plus 2.5 miles more, which comes out to 15 miles. And to complete the final 150 miles, he has to ride for 12 more days. \nNow, since we know that we have to cover  150 miles, divide it by 15, and you get 10. Which tells us, how many miles we have to travel each day. Therefore, if you know how many miles you have to cover each day, you know how much time it would take. \nSo, Jerome can cover 12 miles for the 12th time and on the 13the day he can either cover 12 miles and take some time off, or go for 2.5 miles. \n10*(12+2.5) would take 120 minutes. If you divide 120 by 10, you get 12, which means that Jerome has to go for 12 miles in 120 minutes, which means that he is doing a speed of 10/12 m/s, which comes out to about 8m/s or 4.5mi/h. \nLet us say Jerome is covering 10 miles at the end. Now, 10*12 comes out to 120. In 120/12 minutes, Jerome was able to cover 12 miles, on the 13h day, he is able to cover another 8 miles, which comes out to his total of 20 miles for that day. \nSo 1/20 = 2/40, which means in 1/20th of the 13the hours, he will cover 2 miles.

Also, on Tuesday he watched 4 hours and 14 minutes combined on the Hallmark channel. The question says that on Tuesday he viewed some movies for a total of 90 minutes. So, we can only assume that his time watching Hallmark channel on Tuesday was not for 4 hours and 5 minutes, but for 4 hours and something.\nIf we combine this information and assume that he watched 2 full-length movies (90 minutes each) on Tuesday, then on Wednesday (2 * 90) minutes + 4 hours + 6 minutes = 6(?) hours and something minutes.

{"text": "**The average number of days the Emery and Serena take to read Jack Steve's book is 4 days.**\n\n**First, we need to find the average number of pages each chapter, then, we can find the average number of chapters per book.**\n\nTo calculate the average number of pages per chapter, divide the pages of the book by the total number of pages in the book.\n\nThe book has a total of 480 pages divided by 4, we get 60 pages per chapter.\n\nTo calculate the number of chapters per 100 pages, divide the number of 100 pages by the average number of pages in each chapter.\n\nThere are 13 chapters in the book so, divide the 480 by 60, we get 8 chapters per 1oo pages.\n\nFinally, divide the number of chapters into the number of days each one take to read the chapters.\n\nWe'll find out if the book was read by Emery in 5 days, he then need to read 22 chapters, so he needs to read 22/8 = 2.72 chapters per day. And if he read in 20 days, he read 16 chapters. Which is the same as 4 chapters per day, so, Emery will finish the book in 2.72/4 = 0.6875 days.\n\nSimilarly, Serena must read 26 chapters, to finish the book in 5 days, she will need to read 26/8 = 3.25 chapters per day.

{"text": "Mark would get 4 nickels since the total amount was under 10 cents and the cashier had a bunch of them.\n\n### Rationale: How the question sounds confusing is because of the fact that the cashier has \"a bunch of nickels\" instead of just a bunch/5 of nickels. Let's see why:\nThe 1 cent coin's value is a cent. A nickel's value can be used for either a nickel, or 5 cents.\nIn order to show the cashier got 5 cents from Mark, the cashier would have to give the change back in nickel because the total change was under 10. But Mark only gave the cashier $5.05. Since we know the change had to be at least 10 cents, we would have to subtract 1 coin from the amount to make sure it was at least 10.\nThe cashier has 20 cents in his/her till. This means they have 2 nickels and 1 dime or 2 nickel and 15 cents. Therefore, they have 5 nickels in their till.\nTherefore, because the cashier gives you back 4 quarters and 1 nickel and you only gave him/her $7.00, the cashier gets 50 cents and Mark gets 4 nickels as change.\n\n### Input\"What didn't the kits include?\"\n\n### Demostration:\n\"What didn't kits include\" in this case is to understand the task in two parts.

{"text": "Jack needs to sell 40 cookies\n### Reason 1:Let x represent how many cookies Jack needs to sell.\n\n### Reason:We can use substitution to eliminate the other constraints we were given. We can substitute x in x + 4 + 5x / 40 = 50, or 50 + 2x/40 = 5. Since we aren't given a value for 2x, we can substitute 2x in as a variable like x: 50 + x / 40 = x / 3, or 3x = x. Since we know that x and 1/3 have to equal each other, we can solve for x: x= 3/1. We can plug \"3\" in for x, to get our answer of 40.\n### Output:Jack doesn\u2019t need to get a job so that he can purchase the new basketball uniforms. Instead, he can just sell some cookies! That\u2019s not very hard, either \u2014 in fact, he sold 4 brownies AND 5 lemon squares, so all he has to do is sell 40 cookies to reach his goal! He sold 4 brownies and 5 lemon square\u2019s, so he sold 9 cookies. He can also sell 9 cookies to get to $50! Now he just needs to sell 31 more cookies to get to $4 each, and he has sold 40!\n### Comments:You should always keep in mind what it is you\u2019re trying to figure out. In this case, the goal was to know how many cookies Jack needs sell, so we eliminated constraints that did not contribute that the answer. We could have solved this question by making a chart of all the possible answers, but we only needed one to answer whether or not what Jack needs to sell. In the future, be sure to note that while charts can give you an idea and keep you motivated to keep solving, solving the question in any way possible is better.", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "She keeps 13 dozen chocolate chip and three dozen oatmeel raisin cookies.\n\n### Explanation: The first two sentences describe how Ann bakes 54 cookies and then distributes 44 cookies.\n1. The next sentence, explains that the cookies that are distributed are 15% of the initial batch.\n2. You can interpret this as 10 / 64.1 = 0.159 = 15%\nThe cookies that Ann bakes are 54 + 24 = 78 cookies total\nThe remaining 54 cookies are distributed. That gives her a total of 24 cookies left.\n3. Then 15% of 24 is 3.6, giving you 78 + 3.6 = 81.6\n4. 81.6 is greater than 64 in the question. That means Ann bakes 80 cookies in total, and distributes 64 cookies.\n5. Since she distributes 64 out of 78 cookies (74 left), Ann keeps 13 chocolate chip cookies, and 3 oatmeal raises.\n\n### Input : Which letter would be in your hand if you put it between the F and the G, and you turn the pencil in a counterclockwise direction starting from the F and stopping without turning the pencil once you got to the G?

Choices: 1kg E: $2.00 5 kg E: $3.501 kg E: $4.25 1kg E: 5.00 5kg E: 15.50\nRationales:\n\n1. When we understand the question, we find that the answer is most likely the cheapest 1kg of rice at $2.00.\n2. After reading the choices, and choosing one of them that appears to be the cheapest, we should write the answer that appears the most logical. For these choices, 5 kg of rice seems like the most logical, since it is cheaper than the 3 kg that was mentioned.\n3. Since that option has a matching \"E: $2.0\", it is eliminated, and only two options remain. \n4. Now of course, the most basic question is not, how much does 3 kg of rice cost, but rather, how much does 5kg of rice cost. If we assume that 5kg of rice costs the same a as said in the question, then that would mean that 5kg costs more than 3kg, and the answer would be 5kg.\n5. That 5kg of rice, however, costs more than the 1kg option, so that is eliminated too. That leaves 1kg of rice, which appears the most reasonable to be the answer.\n6. Therefore we should conclude this response with \"When it is the same as the answer to a related question in the 5kg answer. That would make this choice, the cheapest option for 1kg of rice.\"\n7. So the answer is the $2.00 for 3kg of rice.\nAnswer: $2.0\n\nInput: What do you call a", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "John's gym routine makes him spend about __ hours there each week.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. To solve this problem, we need to understand what information we need to answer the question.

Looking at the choice options presented, we can see that only B, C, and E have values greater than one hour, which means that answer D is inaccurate.\n3. Answer option B is less likely because it indicates that he spent a full third of his weightlift time warming up and not lifting weights. This implies that the third of his weight training time he did not spend lifting weights.\n4. Answer option C is not correct because he spends exactly 1 hour each day training, there won't be \"3-hours a day worth of\" remaining for other activities.\n5.

A movie in theater simply refers to the specific moment when a movie is officially released in theaters.\n3. There are definitely going to be multiple events and moments that happen within a movie in a theater. Like watching a movie, before the opening of the film, during the intermission, and after the movie.\n4. Hence, the movie in theaters is a moment when the film is out in cinemas, for people to watch.\n5. The movie itself isn't out yet. There isn't a pre-movie where the film has already shown at a movie theater, and you are waiting for the actual film to start.\n6. The movie is only \"in the theater\" after it is released officially.\n7. Before that, it just is a movie that is shown in theaters.

On the day of field trip, the number girls and boys was the ________ since some of the girls where not able to join the group.\n\n#### Rationale (Intermediate Reasoning):\n\n1. The numbers 8 and 10 refer to the number of boys and girls that were in the bus, respectively. This suggests that the number of boys and number of girls were the same on the day of the field group.\n2. The number of boys and the number of girls were the ________ since ________ the girls were not able. The answer is the blank with a word gap.\n3. The word gap can be filled with the word \"same\" because it can be concluded from the above part that the number of boys equals the number of girls on the day of field trip.\n4. Therefore the answer is \"the same number of girls did not join the field group\".", "answer": " 2"}

The first two are different colors, as they are either a red dress or a pink dress. \n2. The next two are also different colors, a white dress and a yellow dress. \n3. We can now eliminate the final color of a blue dress because it says that the child will probably wear a dress and we already have two dresses that are either blue or white, but not both. 4\n4. The options that will remain are either a red dress, a white dress or a yellow dress. 5 \n5. We can eliminate the red and white dresses because both options have already been mentioned in the previous answers. \n6. This leaves us with a blue dress, it would be out of the norm for a child to wear a blue dress to the beach or any other outdoor activity.\n7.

The student must start clicking. \n3. This means there must be a specific number of clicks that the student must perform before stopping.\n4. Thus, all of the statements except the first statement must be negated. Therefore, the answer would have to be 2: Four times (there is no \"first time\"). \n5. Since there is a certain number of clicks that the child must perform, we can calculate the final number of clicks required. \n6.

Choices: \nA: an ice ball B: a cold C: an explosion D: a snowball E: hail storms\nRationales: The question provides two examples of how \"hail\" can be pronounced.\n1. If describing a bad storm, it is possible to say \"Hail storms\"\n2. If you are referring to a snowball, then it could said to be \"a snowball\". \n3. Thus, the sentence structure should be: \"How is an example of [one of the examples provided] pronounced. Then, to find the correct answer, it is necessary to compare the correct sentence structure to each of the options to see which one fits that structure. Since it should be How is an example of \"hail\" pronounced, the answer should be in line with the correct structure. Therefore, the answer could only be either E: hail storm or D: a snowball.\n4. Based on that reasoning, we know that E: hail storm and D: a snowball are the only ones that can fit the correct structure.

This could be restated as: 4 sleeves = 28 crackers per sleeve, and Chad eates 5 crackers from each sleeve every night.\n2. Let's call this information 'E' = 'Every night' = [E]\n3. Since Chad eats 4 sleeves or 28 crackers every night, this means he needs to eat 140 crackers every night. To do this, he needs to eat  5 sleeves or  280 crackers per day (per month (per year) \ud835\udc5a). \n4. Therefore, Chad needs 140 crackres in the night he eats 4 sleve or 28 crackaers.\n5. For each night of 140 crackras, Chad will need [E] sleves or [E] [E] crackers.\n6.

{"text": "He consumed a total of 260 grams of caffeine\n\n###  Intermediate Reasoning:\nTo solve this, first calculate the total caffeine in the 2 energy drinks and then add the caffeine pill value and divide by 3 to get the answer for John. The caffeine in energy drinks is given in an amount of caffeine per ounce of the drink. Since there are 12 ounces in 1 energy drink, the amount of caffeinte in 15 can be calculated by using the following formula\n\n12ounces X 250 grms of caffeine(per energy drink)= 3000 grams of cffiene.\n\nHowever there are only  2 ounces of the second energy drink since  12ounces X  350 grms( per energy drink)\n\nSince he ate the 2 ounces of second energy drink, you just have to multiple 350 by  2 =700 grams.\n\nThus, he consumed 3000+700=3700 grams of the caffeine.\n\nHe also consumed \n\n`0.15 grms(260(grams))(\u00f7)0.25=960 grams\n\nNow he consumed 3700+960 grams of the  caffeine.

The cranes are a little less than 10% of the structure's height; D. The cranes cannot be a greater number than the height of the building; E.

Given that the crane is \"finishing\" the building, it is safe to assume that the crane is (at least) as tall as the building it finishes (A is false). B. The cranes and buildings have different heights. Although only one building has a height of 147 feet, we cannot say that buildings do not have a height of 228 feet. Given that the cranes can possibly be taller, they are not necessarily slightly more than 147 feet taller. (B is false) C. The cranewould have to be greater than 200% taller than the building. Given that the crank is \"finishing\" a building and at least as tall as that building, we can say that the crane cannot be taller than the building it finishes. For all that we know, 200% may actually be shorter than 147%, but given that we don't know the height of the building the crane is finishing, we can't say that (C is false). D.

{"text": "The half-hour newcast includes 12 minutes for national news and 5 minutes for international news. So, the remaining 15 minutes are for sports and weather. This is already accounted for if we multiply 5 +15. So, there's probably 12 + 2.\n\n### Reasonable:\n\nIf there's a set of numbers such as (12 + 2 = 14), it shouldn't be an exact multiple of other numbers. So, you'll subtract 2 from 15 to get 13 (12 + 11). If you add all these together, it equals the total number of minutes, which is 67. \n\n### Response 2\n\nLet's assume that there are different types of news and there's more than 15 minutes of advertisements. If that's the case, then it's easy. The national news and international news is already given as 12 minutes and 5 minutes. That is already the most time spent for those two categories.\n\nWe are left with the question, \"how many minutes of sports and weather?\" If that's the remaining time, then it simply would have to be 15 minutes. However, if those two categories are the last part of the newscast, then it's just 2 minutes. Since the time limit in total is 60 minutes, subtract the time spent in sports and weather. It equals 12 + 5 - 15, which comes to 67.\n\n### Response3\n\nSince advertisments usually comprise the last few minutes of the newscast (and they are the most common part of a newscast as well), the total number of minutes used for advertisements is likely 2 minutes more than 15. As a result, subtract 15 from the total duration of the newscast.\n\n### Answer: B\n\n### Response0:\nSince there are only 15 minutes of information about weather and sports that leave 2\nminutes left for advertisement, therefore, 2/15 of ads has to be 12 for all.\n\n### Rational:\nAs the time given of advertisements is limited to 15.

Which choice is the obvious first thought but isn\u2019t quite right?\n2. What choice feels like it could be true, but doesn't match the prompt?\n3. Why would a person who had 696 dollars of pay not have worked more than 40 hours?\n4. The company must have an hour threshold for someone to get paid time-and-a-half. What threshold is the company set?\n5. How many hours work did Gary end up getting paid for?\n\n### The correct answer is B.\n\n### Here's why.\n\n1. People tend to over-index on obvious answers at the start of a task. This is fine in the real world, as it's sometimes faster to just guess what was assumed. But in these tests, there's usually more to look for.\n2. When the first and clearest answer is something that's not quite right, there's usually an element we're not thinking about that can create a new response. (This is common with word problems.)\n3. Why didn't Gary work over 40 hours? If he's worked over 40 hours, he's got to already be making the 1.5 times of normal wage. (An extra ten dollars on top of his normal salary for being overtime.) If he was making 1.5 times the $12, that comes out to $18. So if you're making $18/hr on top of your normal $12/hr, then you get $10 for every hour after 42. (He gets an extra $10 if he works after 42, but he can only get an extra $10 for that hour.)\n4. It's possible that Gary had to work over 40 and still get paid the normal $12/hour. So this is why the question then asks for the total paycheck. $12x696 should give us $8224. If Gary got a 40 hour workweek of normal wage and $1.5x for time-and-a half (the normal 1.5 pay), he should have worked about 43 hours.", "answer": " 52"}

Choices:  A(1) B(25) C(250) D(2.6) E(350)\n\nRationales:\n\n1. First step is to calculate the volume of water that will be used to make the cup of water. If you are assuming that the cup is 250 ml, you will need **0.25 x 1000** which is 250mL. Now, we only need to get a value that is less than 250mg, and since 250m is close to 250m, we will have to divide by 10 so that the value which comes out we assume is less than 200. Hence, 0.25mL/10 which is 25cm^3. So, volume of water is 25, which will be our answer.\n\n2. Secondly, since there are more than two choices, we need to think critically. Option B sounds like it will be more than 25 since its value is 255 which is less than 215. To verify, you can try 250 + 45 and you will get less than 211. Since it's the only choice that is greater than the desired value, we can simply eliminate it.\n\n3. Since the answer is option B, you can also check if it is the smallest or the second-smallest. In this case, the smallest answer is E which is 25, but we have covered it already, therefore this should not be a problem but you can check it out if you want to make sure.\n\n4. Thirdly, since the values are integers, you can check and verify that the value of 2", "answer": " 30"}

Next, we need to understand what the purpose of the visit is. Based on the choices, we can decide which of these scenarios has the visit as it's main purpose.\n1. Watching TV might be included, but most likely it is not the main purpose.\n2. Grandma may teach the kids, but this does not directly relate to their visit.\n3. Kids might eat snacks with grandma, but snacks do not have to be involved in the purpose of the visit.\n4. Kids can play games with grandma, but that is also not the main purpose of the visit. \n5. Thus, it is most likely that the kids clean the house whenever they visit their grandma. \n6.

During a weekday, most people probably don't cook breakfast because they usually spend more time on work or other obligations. But, during the weekend, \"most\" people cook breakfast.\n- Rational Two: Most people eat before they go sleep for a variety of reasons. They might want to avoid hunger pangs, stay up longer, or even have something light before they go to bed. But most people don't necessarily eat during evening hours, which is what this question is asking. Therefore, the answer has to something they eat when they go to sleep.

{"text": "The answer is 25\n\n### Explanation: \n\nThe key to this question is to recognize that it's a probability-based problem. The question asks us to determine how many people would expect to play football out of a given group of 25, for a given percentage of people that like it. \n\n1. We can break down the first sentence, \"If 24 out every 60 individuals LIKE football.\" \n2. We can determine this would be 1/4 (or 25%) of the first group. \n3. Therefore, each of the individuals in that group would each have a 25% chance of liking football. \n4. We also need to understand that there are going to be multiple groups of this size. Based on the questions, it's clear that one group of 25 is our main group, and any members of this group that play football will play for our entire group of 25. \n5. Therefore, we can determine that 50% (or 1/2 of the 1/4) would indeed be players. \n6. Put another way: 50% of the 25 individuals out of 250 is 50 people. \n7. We can also rephrase this: 1/2 out of 25 would be players. \n8. Therefore, 1/2 x 25 = the expected number of football players would be 25 and the answer is A: 25\n\n\n### Input/Task Description: \n\n### Instructions: \n\nAnswer the following questions:\n\n### Demostration:\n\nIn this lesson we focus on logical reasoning and analyzing written information to select appropriate answers. \n\nIn this question we are told that people who play music as their job (i.e. a professional musician) don't earn enough money to support their family.

{"text": "Jack can return the codes for the gift cards with one dollar's worth of value remaining.\n\n### Rationale: 1. The gift cards in the scam don't need to be returned if they were not used. 2. The scammer's request to return the codes from gift cards with 6 cards' worth of value and 9 cards' worth of value means they weren't used. 3. Jack can return the remaining codes for each of the gift cards, as the scammer only wants the codes from gift cards that have at least $200 value each. Each card that Jack has returned has a code with a $500 value.\n4. Therefore the only gift card card each having a value of $600 that Jack hasn't returned is one with a value of $1000. He can return the remaining codes.\n5. The gift cards that Jack has returned have a total value of $1200, of which $600 belonged to the same $1000 card that Jack has returned. So, the remaining $600 that remained after returning the two cards came from three cards. \n6. The three cards that Jack returned have a total value between $500 and $2499. To meet the scammer's demands, at least one of them should be worth $2499, and Jack has only returned two that were worth that much. \n7. So, Jack should have returned a $2499 card, which he hasn't.\n8. The number of gift cards that Jack returned have values between $500, and $2498. So, the value of two gift cards that Jack hasn't yet returned can be between $2499 and $50000. \n9. Between these two value differences, $600 is the largest difference between the values that exist. Only those with a total value between $2500 and $5001500 can be returned as the remaining values. So, Jack received a total of 78 gift cards. 10. So, the value that each gift card has must be an even number. Since the remaining $60 can't be $6000, we can then eliminate any gift card with a value of $6500, as", "answer": " 3900"}

In this question, we know that the blue car can travel at 80 miles per and hour, so we need to find out how much faster the red car can travel. So we know that whatever value we plug in for the red one has to be greater than 80 miles per/hour.\n\nBut we also know that the red one can travel at two times the speed of the green car, so we know we can't divide 80 by 2.\n\nThe only operation we can perform on the information we have from the question is multiplication. We can't divide, add or subtract because there isn't an \"if\" operation that corresponds to that kind of mathematical operation. And we can't take the square root because the cars are cars and not radii, circles or segments of a circle.\n\nSo we know we need to multiply, so we take the amount the green one can travel and then we take the speed of the blue car and multiply them. The result is 160 miles per hour!\n\nAs you can see, that's the only question Dale asked himself. He just knew he needed to find the answer. He didn't make a list of possibilities, or try to come up with a solution where the blue car was going 1.5 times faster than the green.

Since coffee refers to drinking it during the daytime, while water, ice cream, soda, and juice are all enjoyed as beverages, this means Tom would prefer a hot or cold liquid, not a solid.\n3. Finally, since chocolate is considered a dessert and is also sold as ice cream, it can also be classified as a cold or hot liquid to fit the description.\n4.

{"text": "24% Dark Chocolate, 10% Milk chocolate with almand, 6% White Chocolate, 4% Milk Chocolate\n\n### Demonnstration:\nTo begin with, note that Milk with almond bars have twice the chance of getting pulled out from the box, making the chances of being not pulled 6/25. \n\nNext, note that the chances of the white chocolate are halved in the same way.\n\n### Then, we work out for some dark chocolate, and get 10% which are 7 bars out of 70.\n\n### Further, with the milk chocolate we note that it is halved from almond bars.\n\nThird, we get 25 bars out of the 90, giving us a percentage of 24% Dark chocolate.\n\nWe can use the steps above to work out for the remaining two.\n\n### Additional Demonstration: The key here is to know and understand the probability of each case.\n\n### Input 2: A school has 100 students who will sit 25 students per class. If we number each class in sequence, what is the sequence number before the one in which the student in seats 22 will be assigned? \n\n### Demonsation: \n\nThe key here is to notice the order that each class is being assigned to the individual students.\n\nFirst notice that, in general, the numbering starts at number 1 and the sequence of the class assignation. Then we note that if the student was assigned to class 22, then the class that the student should be in is class -1. Therefore, we subtract one from each of those numbers to notice that the student in class 22 would be assigned to the class -1.\n\nWe can continue with logic and reasoning to notice the number before the sequence of assignment of the students. For example, a student is assigned to class -1, the class before that will be -2.\n\nTo complete the process, we can get it easily by subtracting the number -2 from 25, and then moving left and repeating the logical thinking process to get the remaining part and ending up with the answer that the student would sit in class -3.\n\n##", "answer": " 25"}

She did not walk straight as Maisie did. So I drew a wavy line to explain that.\n\nNow the last thing to explain is why I drew the straight line to go left and the wavy line to go right. \n\nLet's say I had a wavy line for Maisie and a straight line for Donna. If anything, we'd see a diagonal line for the walk where Maisie goes which is not very much different from the wavy line I made.\n\nSo to emphasize the point to people reading this task I chose to draw the wavy line for Donna to clarify.\n\nNow that we have Maisie and Donna's paths. Let's compare.\n\nTo start off, Maisie did a walk that was not straight. So I drew her wavy line and walked straight through it.\n\nNow to Donna, I could walk straight to her houses, which is what I did on the left side.\n\nNow on my straight walk, I came to a junction where there is a corner or a T shape. I stopped there.\n\nI drew it because the straight line that I drew was the first place I stopped. Then, to start the diagonal line, I started at that point and continued the line upwards. \n\nThat's why I drew the squiggly line for half the length I walked on my diagonal.\n\nNow, that we have all 3 walks, let's take a look at the right walk.\nDonna's walk that I drew with my squiggly line.\nLet's walk to an intersection, which I circled.

Here, our goal is to find out how many blue candles Avianna bought.\n2. The question also tells us that Avianna had a total of 85 candles.\n3. Therefore we can use the given information to try to answer the question about the number of blue candles.\n4. Let's start with the ratio: the ratio of red: blue candles Aviana bought was 5:6.\n5. This tells us that Aviana bought 5 times more red candles than blue candles.\n6. We also know the ratio of red:blue candles was 5:6, so therefore 6 times fewer blu candles than red candles was bought.\n7. Therefore, we can write the situation and the unknown (in this case, number of blue candles) symbolically:\n\n(Red:Blue) = 5:6\n85 = 5\u22c55\n(Red:Blue ) + 6\u22c56 = 5\u22c55 + 6\u22c56\n100+36=5*5+15\n500=550\n\n8.

{"text": "(399.6666667 dollars)\nThis question was asked as part of the interview. To answer it, we need to use a bit of arithmetic.\n\nWe know 20% of 200=40, which means that 40 of the 200 tickets are winners.\n\nWe also know 20% winners win x5, so 20% wins 5, 20% wins x5, 20 wins x5.\n\nWhich makes 200 tickers, 20 winners, 20 x5, which is 100 x5.\n\nSo we can say, James won 100 x 5 winning 500. So he spent $200 on tickets and made $500 profit.\n\nSo his profit was $300. But how much did he profit, really? 500/2= 250, which means that $1/4th of those tickets were winners, which makes 24,6 of the 204 tickets were winners. But he spent $204 for 204 tickers.

{"text": "Nora could park in 198 open parking spats. There are 52 open spaces per level, except for the first level, which only has 48. Since 58 is greater than 48, you would expect the first level to have at least 52 spaces. However, the garage only has 48, so Nora would not be able to park her car on the first level.\n\n### Rationals: The task asks, \"How many full parking spats are there in all?\" The word \"full parking spats\" indicates that the garage has spots that are not empty. \nTo find the total number of full parking spats, we need to determine the number of empty spaces and subtract this from the total number of spots in the garage.\nTo do this, we first need to subtract the number of open spots of the first level from the total number of 100 spats. This gives 508 spats minus 58 spats which equals 450 spats. The next step involves subtracting 2 more open spats on the second level than the first level and subtracting 5 more open spats on third level than the second level. This gives 450 minus 2 equals 448 - 5 equals 443. The final step involves subtracting 31 open spats on the fourth level and we get 443 minus 31 spats which equals \n412. \nTherefore, there are 412 full spaces in all which is the response.\n\n### Input:\"\n\n24\n\n+ 36\n\n= \n\n5\n\n__\n\n100\n\n+ 81\n\n- 68\n\n+ 63\n\n+ 106\n\n- 94\n\n- 41\n\n+ 1\n\n- 11\n\n- 30\n\n+ 28\n\n+ 40\n\n- 56\n\n- 34\n\n- 36\n\n+ 42\n\n- 25\n\n- 17\n\n+ 30\n\n- 19\n\n+ 37\n\n- 152\n\n- 45", "answer": " 186"}

Choices:  a: London b: New York c: Toronto d: Los Angeles e: Chicago\nRationales:\n\n1. Given the question, 'Which of these three cites has an annual growth that is less than equal to one percent?'\n2. We can discard D: Los Angeles, since its population growth is less than 1%.\n3. We can also scrap the 'growth' part of the question (C: Toronto), which doesn't make much sense unless we assume Toronto's population is decreasing by one percent every year.\n4. That leaves us with four other cities to choose from.\n5. However, 'less than equal to' is ambiguous. Can it simply be a 'less than' statement? Can the choices be reversed?\n6. By breaking down the options and looking at each of them individually, we find that A: London and E: Chicago can't have growth less than one percent since London's population doubled in just the past few decades and Chicago's population is also increasing steadily.\n7. That leaves us with two options, B: New York and  D: Los Angeles.\n8. But by reading the options, each one of these actually has an annual growth which is less than or equal 1%.\n9. Therefore, we can only conclude that both A: London and E; Chicago have a population growth less than equal to 1%\n10. Therefore, the correct answer would be either 'A' or 'E'.\n11. Which is to say, either London or Chicago.\n12. For me, a logical conclusion is that 'less than equal to', given how it is phrased, could mean 'less than' and therefore London does seem to fit that description.\n13. But New York, as well, could fit that description, since its growth rate is still less than one percent (0.86%, to be exact). Hence, D: New York is technically possible as well.\n14.

{"text": "Save $32 in the month of December\n\n### Explanation:The question asks how much should she save in each of the months so she has a total of $150 at the end of the year. We can eliminate options that don't work, like January, where she can't earn more than zero. \nFor the month of February, saving $10 will result in a total of $110 and not the desired $150. \nContinuing in this pattern, we need to make sure she saves $100 in the month of December and the question gives us the option of saving $15 or $130 to reach the savings goal. \nHowever, saving $15 or more in the month of December will put her savings back to the starting level. So instead, she should save just $12 per month so she ends with $150 by the end of the year, or $13 per month to reach $150 if she saved $190.61 in the months before.\nAnswer:The question asks how you would write a 08/02/2020 date in words.\n\n### Input://dev/null\n\n### Instructions:Write the date as a whole number, such as \"2020/02/08.\"\n\n### Rationales: The question asks for the date \"08/02\" to be written in words.

We can eliminate option 1 as it has \"/\" or divide in the number, which does not make sense for a date. \n2. We can also eliminate options 2 and 3 since they are both single numbers which do not make any sense for a date.\n3.

{"text": "### Intermediate Reasoning\nThis question contains a word problem with the expression A \"is ___ than B\" on both sides of the equation.\n### Reasoning Steps\n1. The question describes the relationship between the two variables in the problem. \n2. To solve this equation, we need to rewrite one of them in terms of the other.\n3. Since both \"12\" and \"70\" are integers, \n4. \"12\" is divisible by 4 (integer factorization) resulting in 3, while \"70\" is divisible by the factors '7', '10' and '70' resulting in 7, 10, 10. 5. So, we can rewrite the equation as:\n7*12 =7*10 + 7*7 + 7*10 + \"12\" 6. On the left side of the equation, we have \"7\", so \"12\" is equal to the sum of \"10\" and \"7 * 10\" 7. The sum on the left side comes to 22, while on the right side it is 84. 8. Therefore, the expression \"12\" is equivalent to 84. 9. So, on the right side of the equation, \"12\" becomes 84.10 10. Since \"12\" is now equal to 84, we need to subtract 84 from both sides of the equation to solve it. 11. Subtracting 84 from both the sides results in:7*(12-84) =(70-7)10\n12. On the left side, since \"70-7\" becomes 63, we get \"7*(12-63)\"\n13. \"12\" becomes \"12-63\" as it is smaller than \"63.\" \n14. And \"63\" is smaller than 12, so we have 7* \"12-64\" and therefore 7* 59. 15. \"59\" is still divided by 4 and in fact that number comes out to 15, so 7*15 =7*7 which equals 49. 16", "answer": " 41"}

{"text": "After Ben whitewashed 1/10 of the fence, Billy whitewashed 12/5 of the remaining fence, and Johnny whitewashed 8/3 of what was left. Since there are 94 feet left, they need to whitewash only 12.3/94 of the fence, which is 0.13 feet or 13/100 of the fence.\n\n### Rationales: First, we need to understand exactly how much of the fence is left. From the options, we subtract the part that Ben whitewashed 4/10 of the original fence, which is how much the fence was whitewashed by the first two friends combined. So the total left to whitewash is (8/5) + (1/10)-4/10 = 16/100.\n\n### Here, Johnny whitewashed 18/100 and that is what we call 8/3 of 16/19. So the fraction left to whitewash = (16/19)-(8.25/9.25) = (3/19).\n\n### This means that they need to whitewashed (((3)/(19)) * (16.748)) = (12.3052) feet.\n\n### So when Ben whitewashed 3/10, Billy whitewashed (((1/10)+(4/5)) * (12.3174)) = (12), 3052) = (14.6559), and Johnny whitewashed ((((8/3)+(1/6)) * (16/18)) = (16/552), or 16.7432, respectively.\n\n### Total = 42.6\n\n### Input : How many days can a team finish the fence?\n\n### Intermediate Reasoning: \n\nIn the question, there are three options and 42.6 is close to a ratio of (3:4).

{"text": "Forty percent.\n\n\n### Explanation: \nThe answer is 40%, which is the percentage of students who have elected to learn from \nhome during the pandemic. This means that the remaining students are split into two \nequal groups, of which 50% (or half) are physically in school on a given day. So, we can\nexclude all those students who are in school on a given say. From the remaining 50%, we\njust need 1 student who is in the school. Thus, 10% of the remaining students are present \nin school on a given day and the answer is 40% - 10% which is equal to 40%.\n\n### Input : A new car has a higher probability of crashing than an old car.\n\n### Rationales: \nIf a new car has a higher chance of crashing than an older car, that implies that there is something about the older car that reduces the probability of a crash. We can't explain why a newer car would have a higher chance of crash unless we understand how the characteristics of an old versus new car can impact a crashing event. Some things about older cars which can cause a crash to be less likely are their safety and their condition. Older cars tend to be less safe because the crash test technology for vehicles isn't as developed as it is for modern cars. When older cars were first made, car seatbelt technology was in its early stages and crash-test airbags were not present, meaning that a crash would be more dangerous in an older vehicle. Newer cars have safety features that protect passengers in the case of a crash. Another factor of older and newer cars is condition. Older cars are more likely to have mechanical defects due to lack of regular maintenance. A car with frequent repairs is more likely to have an engine or transmission failure due to a leak or overheating than a newer car that is well maintained. Additionally, older models tend to lack the fuel economy and horsepower of modern vehicles and therefore rely more on engine power for their driving performance than a newer car. Older cars may also lack the safety technologies and stability of more modern designs and therefore pose a higher risk of a crash. This means that an older car is much more likely to have mechanical problems and a lower degree of crash-test safety. \n\n### Input", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "225 metres\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 5 math question.\n\nInput: Jesse was playing basketball with three friends.  Each person got one free throw at the start of each game, and then they had to try to make field goals by shooting from behind the free throw line.  However, once someone makes a field goal, the ball must be returned to where it started (at the free throw line), before the next person can try his or her free throw.  The first player to get three field goals wins.  During a game at school, Jesse's free throw percentage went down, but he started making field goals.  His friends told him that he was using his feet to help him make those three field goals.  How many free throws did they play, in terms of how many feet they walked to return the basketball?\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales: First, we need to understand how a free throw works and how the ball should be returned to the free throw line before the next person can throw.\n\nTo make a free throw, a player must shoot the ball from the free throw line and successfully land it in the basket. Once the free throw is made, the basketball is returned to the original player or spot on the free throw line, and then the next player in turn throws the ball. This ensures that each player has an equal opportunity to make a free throw.\n\nThe \"how many feet\" part refers to the distance walked to return the ball. The ball is returned by the player who made the free throw and was taken to the free throw line where he or she had the shot. The footprint or distance on the ground that the player walked is a free throw.\nRationales:\nThus, to win a free throw, a team must be able to make three shots from the free throw line, with at least one free throw each.\n\n### Answer: \nInput: The student who aced his math test walked from class to class, on average, 0.55 miles a day?

We know that 1/5 would mean one from every five coins have a certain characteristic, in this case, being a state quarter. But when 2/5 comes up, this tells us that among two coins from every five coins we have 1/5 chance of getting it, or 1/10 in total.\nNow knowing that, we can write the total number of quarters and the number of quarters that are Pennsylvania as: Total=35 and Pennsylvanias = number-2/10.\n\nTo get to the answer, we can write the equation: 35-0.25= (35/10)-0.25=50-0.25/10=25.\n\nSo, the answer is 25.\n\nNext: Write a response to the following instruction.\n\n### Task: Write the correct response.\n\n### Rationales/Instructions:In the table below, find the value of each expression.

The key question here is what is the duration of his trip. \n2. The question asks how many hours per day is he driving at 55mph. \n3. To find the answer to that we're going to want to solve that equation. \n4. There are two constants in that, that we should be able to get rid of. So, we know from the question we have a 180 miles per day, 55 miles per each hour.\n5. There are two constants that we know can be eliminated, 180 and 55.\n6. You would solve the equation like this, 1X55(4)=180, X is the variable that we need, divide both sides by 55, X= 3. From there we know that he's doing 3 hours of driving for that 180 miles.\n7.

{"text": "There are three solutions to this problem. \n\n### Solution #1 [Explanation]:The statement, There are six more white birds, suggests that there are 36 white birds.\nHowever, the total number of both white and grey birds before any birds were freed is 40. This means that six more must have been freed, making the total number of both types of birds at 46.\nSubsequently, the total number of birds who remained after the ten-minute period is 5 (4 + 5 = 9 + 6 = 15 > 15 > 46 > 5).\nThis can also be explained as:\n\n### Solution 1: There are six more white in the cage, and the total number of white and grey birds is 40.\n\nThus, there must have been 36 when no birds had been freed. \n\nThis means that six more must are have been released, raising the total number of birds in the cage to 46. Subsequently, the total birds in the cage after the ten-minutes period must be 5.\n\n### Solution#2 [Explanation]:When there were only 36 white birds and the total number of birds was 46, there must have been ten grey birds.\n\nSince there were 46, then there can be a maximum of 10 more, and there can be a minimum of 10 less.\n\nThus it is possible that there 10 more grey birds.\n\nThus if there are 6 more than 10, there is the possibility of the total number of birds is 50 and the only possible scenario is for the total number of birds to be 51 white birds and 5 grey birds, since it can't be more than 4 birds in one category.\n\n### Solutions #3: [Explanation]:\n\nThe total number of birds, both types in the cage is given as 40.\nThere will be 4 plus 10 or whatever number 10 is greater than 3 or 11 or whatever number is 10 more than 3.\n\nThis means that the total number of white birds in the cage will be 11 (since 50-40 = 5+11", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": "The solution is 41. The total amount of mail to deliver is 180, while two friends deliver 41 each, which means that Johann only has to deliver the remaining 139 pieces of mail.\n\n### Rationales:\nThere are two choices for the total amount being delivered, \"180\" or \"320\". They are both the same amount. The answer, however, is not both correct. Both cannot be true, nor both false. So, if you were to choose the two statements as true and false, they would be both false.\n\nA \"180\" means that all the pieces of mail total 180. If \"all the pieces\", then they must be equal. This means that the sum must be equal to the total.\n\nThe solution statement, \"The total amount of mail to delivery is 180. Each of the three men deliver 41 pieces, so Johann only needs 139 pieces to deliver\", indicates they total of 180 is indeed 180. So, the rest of the statement is true.\n\nIf you were to reverse the solution statement, \"The delivery of 180 pieces is split evenly between two men, and Johann needs to deliver the remaining 320 pieces, what happens will be the same. Because, if the delivery is split evenly between the two men, how much each has is equal to the total of all pieces.

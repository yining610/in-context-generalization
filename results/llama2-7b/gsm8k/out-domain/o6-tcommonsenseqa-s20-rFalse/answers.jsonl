It has provided millions of access to information they didn\u2019t even know existed some years ago. This information is now more easily available for anyone interested in learning.\n\n### Revision:\n\nAgreement:\n* Yes, this statement explains nicely the internet's democratic process to me.\n* What do you mean with \"in how we do our daily doings\", do you mean how are we doing our daily doings? because that's grammatically wrong. \n\nDisagreement:\n* The internet has resulted in huge changes to how we go about doing daily tasks. \n* That sentence is like a run-on sentence, it also doesn't make any sense, it should read \"it has provided millions of access for information that they didn't even know existed some year ago. \n\n### Statements II:\nThanks to the internet, people worldwide can learn to do and make anything. Even better, what they do or make is of their making and to their taste. All these have never been easy as they are now for any individual.\n\n### Response I:\n\nAgreemnt:\n* Yes, the internet has enabled people to learn and gain access to information they didn't know existed. Some of these information includes: How to make/ do anything, what to do, what not to do, how to prevent issues like climate change. It has also enabled worldwide people to work together in solving world issues.  Like the climate change project that won the Nobel Prize!\n\nDisagrement:\n* In a country like Nigeria the biggest problem we have is internet security. You can't trust people. This internet democratization process is not for us but for only countries where this issue is none in existence.\n\n### References\n---\n* [Internet Democratization Process](https://www.thoughtco.com/internet-democratization-process-4152851).\n* [Dem", "answer": " 36"}

You will be provided with a number of students and their reading habits. You must check for each student whether he read one or more than one novel. If he did not read a novel, we print his index (i.e. index of that row) into the variable n. We check for each index whether they read one or more novels. If they read more than one novel, we increment n. If not, we print 1. In this way, we print the number of students who did not read novels. \n\n### Demostration:\n\n```C++\nvector<vector<int>> arr;\nint n = 240;\nfor(int i=0; i< n; i++)\n{\n    vector<int> students;\n    //reading details are provided through a separate array\n    students = {0,0,0,0};\n    arr.push_back(students);\n}\n```\n\n### Instuctions:\n\nNow that you have already written a counting code that finds the number of students who don't read novels, write a new counting function which will print out whether the student read one novel or more than one, and for the students who read one novel, print out their specific index (student number).\n\n### Demstration:\n\n```python\ndef answer()\n    with open(r\"E:\\1.txt\", 'r') as f_handle:\n        reader = csv.reader(f_handle)\n        for line in reader:\n            arr.append(line)\n        \n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        student = arr[i]\n        #find the number of students reading no novel\n        num_no_novel = sum(item == 0 for item in student)\n        #check if read only one novel\n        if (student[3] == 1): #read only if 3rd row has 1\n            print(i + 1 + \", \", str(student[3]))\n        #otherwise count the read novels and check", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "Mike's salary  now is $1400    Fourteen hundred.\n\n### Explanation:In five months, Mike made 10 times the salary of Fred.\n\nFred's salary was $100. Mike made $1000.\n\nNow the situation is explained but what needs to be solved is how many years ago Mike was making 10 times the amount of Fred.\n\nSince $100 (what Fred earned) multiplied by 10 yields $1,000, the situation involves multiplying one time what Fred earned by ten.\n\nThe formula for multiplying what Fred earns by ten is:  $10F   $1,00 $100\n\nMike makes $1,800 now(calculation).\n\nSometimes it is easier to work the other way around first.\n\n$100 and $1800 are both products of $10 times $100 (100 is the starting number for both $1000 and $1,80o)\n\nThink about this:Mike's current salary was made by multiplying something by ten times what Fred earned.\n\nBy setting up a problem where the goal is to find something by multiplying $100 by what, the answer of $1000 is the correct one.\n\nFred made $10 when the ten is multiplied by $100, but $1 when the ten is multiplies by $1,00.\n\nYou're given the current salary of $1,80, then the formula is:\n\n$1800=10 * $1,00\n\nFred made:  $1 when the ten was multiplied by $1\n\nMike makes: $1000 when the ten is multippied by $1,0800\n\nOr, Mike makes 10 times his current wage times what Fred earned.  $1.800 is 10 times what (Mike's current wage) times what (Fred earned before).  \n\n### Input:#The movie was about two sisters who go through a tragic event in their lives and end up joining a cult, but their true purpose was to stop the", "answer": " 15400"}

{"text": "The answer is 45 trash cans.\n\n### Justification: In the question, the town added 2 more garbage cans for each store. In a math concept, a variable is a word that stands for a number and there are an equal number of garbage cans as there are stores.

Choices:  I: float a small bottle II: raise a small bottle I: take a small bottle below E: lower a small bottle\nAnswer: I: float a small bubble\n\n### Response:\"The bottle will be floating because if it was submerged in water, the air would not be able to escape because if it could, it would be rising, but when submerging is not enough, then the air could escape by popping, thus causing it to float.\"\n\n### Justifcation: The first two sentences describe some of the ways a small bottle could be placed under water to see if the air can escape. The third sentence is actually an incomplete sentence, but the \"so\" after the period could show that the sentence relates the third to the second so that they fit together properly. The next sentence is the most complicated sentence and uses an appositive (\"which\" is a pronoun and an \"appositive\" is a noun that relates to another noun). When the sentence is finished, the third and fourth sentences together describe how the bottle will be floating in the water. The last sentence has a similar use of appositives between nouns and nouns and pronouns and noun pairs.\n\n### Sample: Here is an example of a math task that has two answers.\n\n1.

All of the fruits that were checked were fresh. 15% of the fruits picked were checked and were thrown away because they were not fresh. The non fresh fruit are thrown away so the fruits that are checked stay the same. So if the total number of fruit picked are 250 then the amount of fruit Brenda has left are 250 - 15. 150 were checked and 15 were thrown away. So when the fruits were left it was 15 and 250/2 left over. So when it was added it got you 250-15 = 400.\n\n### Source Code:\n\n### https://github.com/jwmh518", "answer": " 135"}

{"text": "The correct answer is $30.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks what percentage of total sales that the buyer did in Mr. Brandon' second business of his shop. To me, this statement means that the percentage of the total sales must be 2/5 or 40%. To get this value, you must get all you have in cash, and not credit. You start with $80 in total sales from Mr. Brandon. Then, one-fifth of this total is $16, as you will buy the percentage of 40% of cash sales. Now, we are subtracting the 2/5 total amount, leaving us the remaining of the total sales amount. The number we get, $64, is the amount that Mr. Brandon got in cash. By using the formula: total sales($80) - cash sales($40) you can calculate that the value of Mr. Brandon got from cash sales, which was $64. With this reasoning, we can get to the correct answer of $30.\n### Notes:\n\n#### Coding Standard\n* I have placed my solutions into the same folder as the problem.", "answer": " 48"}

After ten minutes if half of the birds in cage fly away, then total number of birds remains remains is 25.

The factors should result in one or more, so that one can share easily. This is because, if you divide equally then it may not give exactly 5, for the example it will give either 4 or 6 depending on what the remainder amount is, so this means that the muffins aren't being equal.\n\n#### What is important on this task?\nThe task that I am analyzing is how many muffins Jessie should give to her friends. The main goal of the task is to give exactly 5 muffins to each of her friends.\n\n#### Explanation of why one answer is better than another\nThe answer that is best is 'D', because it is divided equally, and each person gets five muffins each.\n\n#### Which answer was a surprise? If so, which one? \nNo answer was surprising because the answers were all equal, and any one of them could or couldn't be Jessie's solution.\n\n#### Evaluation of the answers\nThe options that were available were C and D, but D is the option that makes more sense in the process because it is the answer that is equal, and it is the answer that the question is looking for. (I think this because the question was \"How many muffins\" and not \"How many can we divide\")\n\n### How many total options were in this task?\n\nToday I created 6, but there could be fewer, or more, but I think that they would be similar to the ones we had created, because they have to do with numbers and division.\n\n### Which answer was best and why?\n\nThe answer that was best for me is the 91st answer, because it was the first answer that I created, and I felt that it made sense, and it was a good answer.

{"text": "Let the symbol for the first floor be f, the symbol for the second be s, so on and so forth.  Therefore, all the floors together have f(10) symbols. A floor has 10 rooms of which one is unavailable. Therefore all possible rooms have f(10)-11 symbols. Therefore, f(10)-f(10-11)=9 and since f(10) and f(10-1) both end with 1, therefore f(10)-(10-1)=9.  So to write 9 symbols using the symbols mentioned earlier, we should use the f symbol 9 times.  Therefore, the answer is f(10)=f(9)=f(8)=f(7). All of the remaining floors should be the same since it is a hotel. For example, a room would be f(7)+f(7)+f(6) meaning that each floor is the same as the floor before it.  The total f(7)+f[7+7+6]+f[7+7] = f(14)=f(12).  When f(7) is repeated, then f(12)=f(11).

{"text": "The maximum weight of the next elevator passenger should be 70.5 pounds. To figure this out we must first subtract each adult's weight from 600. Then we must subtract each weight of the children from the total. This leaves us with 600-140-260=600-160=440. This is how much is left.

The formula calculates `a/(a*d)` where `a` is what we are assuming is his typing speed, `b` is the reduced rate when he has the injury, and `d` is how many words per minute that he is typing. We will start this off with our variables defined.\n\n`a`:  The rate that Mike type in words.  This is equal to `65`.\n\n`b`:  The rate that he is typing with his injury. This is equal to `45`.\n\n`d`:  The number of words for per minute that Mike types. This is equal to 1200.\n\nThen, we can plug in the variables into the formula. We will use the fact that `x` will be equal to whatever we want to find and plug in the numbers that we want to find.\n\n`x`:  How many minutes will it take for him to type the document.\n\n`a` :  The variable `a`.\n\n`b` :  The variable we want to substitute in for.

We will define this as the reduced rate `45`.\nFinally, for the conclusion we will use the values that we defined as `45` and 1200 and let the formula calculate the answer for us.

{"text": "* The rule of one gallon per inch of fish should say in total that there are 32 gallons of water needed for the two-inch fish and the three-inch fish and the one less inch needed for the first tank fish.\n\nThe first tank is twice the second tank's size, where the second tank has 48 gallons. Double is 96 gallons. So, the first tank has 96 gallons\n\nThe way I get the number of fish is I multiply each tank's gallons needed by their inches of fish.\n\nThe second tank would need 96 gallons of water: 3 inches of fish needs 96 gallons and so 8 inches needs 3 times 96, so that is 288 gallons.\n\nSo the first tank will need the second tank's water of 48 gallons plus the first tank's 96 gallons plus the first fish's 96 extra gallons. So, 95 gallons extra.\n\nTo get how many extra fish, I will say it this way: \n\nEach fish tank needs x inches at the total gallons. In order for the first tank to be able to have the first 4 fish, the first tank is 3 inches and the 95 gallons and the other tank is 2 inches and 3 times its (2 inches times 95)\n\nSo the first fish eats 2 fish. The second tank is also not 3 times larger than the tank it is only 1 times bigger. So to the problem, it will just reduce the fish that can be in each tank. It does not need the 96 gallons, it needs 288 gallon so it has to shrink the inch the first tank is 4 inches, so each of the first tank's fish can only eat 3 thirds.\n\nSo, the first tank would have 3*16.\n\nAnd the other tank is 12*3.\n\nNow, to answer the question it is not the first two-thirds are in the two tanks and it is 3 fish in the first tank are gone.\n\nThat means, even taking the 2nd tank and making the two fish it only had 10 fish, and it would still be that way because 1*", "answer": " 3"}

There is this statement in the problem, \"Her previous movie cost $5 per minute to film\", so the total cost of the first movie is going to be 50 min * 50 min, plus the additional time that the new movie takes, which is 1 min * 60 min, or 61 more minutes.  So total cost of the first one is 61 minutes for 55 minutes of footage, and total cost of the second is 60 minutes * 2 * 50 dollars per minute.  So the total cost would be 35160 dollars total.\n\n#### Test: \n* Input:  Total cost of the first film: 61 minutes times it\u2019s footage time times that it cost 50 dollars per minutes.  We get 3516 dollars total. \n* Input: So the total time of the film is 60 minutes plus 1 minute, and the total cost is 3516 hundred dollars. \n* Input:\"The next movie cost 2 times this cost per minute\"   2 * 3516 = 7032 dollars per minute.\n* Input:Total cost 3516 + 2 * 3542 + 1194 = 42574 dollars total.\n\n### Input:\"1194 is 1194 more dollars than 3516\"\n* Input: 1194 is $1194 more than 35100 dollars total.

Python is a C# style language\nthat is both easy to read and understand.  It also takes a more organic\nattempt than other languages to approach programming.\n  \n  - When you make a typo in Python the computer will let you know by\n  highlighting it in Red. Python will also give you an option to correct\n  your error.  C++ or C# have a difficult time with this and you often\n  have to retype your entire program.\n  \n  Python has the option for you to have many users writing in one code\n  and running it at the same time. You can run your programs as fast as\n  any of the C# languages.  Also, all the libraries that you may need are\n  already built into Python.  There is no", "answer": " 150"}

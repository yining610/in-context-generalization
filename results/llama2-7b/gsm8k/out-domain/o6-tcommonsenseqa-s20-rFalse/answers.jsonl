{"text": "Choices:  A) $5.40 B) $5.00 C) $6.00 D) $6.40 E) $3.20\nAnswer: D) $6.0\n\n###Instructions on how to write the code:Your answers will need to be written in C++. \n\n###A: First the question is being read and the input is being passed to a function isRead() that processes the input. \n\nA1: We use an if statement in readString() which checks if the first two characters are a number. If it is, we use convertLetters() that converts the letter to number. If not, it goes to else if and continues to check if the other characters are letters. As soon as it founds a letter, the program is being exited and the answer and input are being printed out. Here\u2019s the function isRead(): \n\n    // This function reads the first token from the input provided\n    char *isRead (char*str)  \n    {  \n        if (str[0] < 48 || str[0] > 57)/*1>*/\n        {  \n            int i = 1;  \n            while (str[i] < 48 && str[i] > 57 && i < strlen(str))  \n            {  \n                i++;  \n            }  \n            input[0] = str[0];  \n            i++;  \n            str[0] = str[-1];  \n            i--;  \n            input[1] = str[i];  \n            return input;  \n        } else  \n        {  \n              convertLetters(str);  \n              /*while not at an eof statement  \n              {  \n                input = getchar();  \n              }*/\n              return str;//this line is not needed!\n        }  \n    }\n\n###B: The program reads an input and stores the input in a char array. The program then checks if any letters appear in the input. If any letters appear, the program does not execute any instructions after converting the letters to numbers. After a letter is being converted to a number, the input is being stored into another array and the answer is being printed.\n\nB1: Here\u2019s", "answer": " 21"}

It was called a hollow river. A hollow river can be defined in its literal sense as to be a river that has dug out for itself a deep hollow. Such hollow rivers are generally found in certain parts of the Himalayas where deep gorges have been formed on either side of the river. However the hollow river that was the subject of the story was not literally such a hollow river. \n\nThis hollow river was made hollow by the dews that dropped in the night. It was made hollow by heavy downpour of rain. It was made hallow by the water that constantly flowed through it. That hollow river had made of itself a hollow river. This means it became hollow by its own efforts. It became hollow by the hard work of its rivermen. What did the author mean when referring to this river as a \u2018hollow river\u2019?\n\n1.

For example, it might be that some of the results are \"negative\" results while the rest are positive results. However, the results could vary from one single measurement to many random measurements.  If this is the case, you cannot simply pick a single average of these values.  Instead, a statistical test, like the \"z test\" must be used to analyze the data.  \nThe \"z test\" evaluates how likely the probability of a negative or positive result is depending on how many measurements were performed.  \nSuppose that there were 5 measurements of the concentration.  If three of them are positive and two are negative, how likely is it to be a positive result for 5 measurements? (The expected number of positive observations is 3 and the expected number of negative observations is 2.)\nOutput: B: -0.03\n\nInput:You are given a set of words.

To find a fractional part:\n\nIf n is a natural number, and m is a whole number such that n/m = w/n and y = w, then the fractional part of y is m. That is, the fractional part of a number x is the smallest integer k, 0 <= k < x, such that n/m > x.\nFor example, if n = 8 and m = 2 and y = 7, then 7 is three eights of y.

And you seem to be on the right track about that the 9 is included only after both numbers have already been read, but you actually don't need to include the 9 here, because of course 1/9 is the same as 1/10, so the number of fractions is fixed. One reason for that is the limit when the fractions reach numbers that can't be expressed in integers (for example, 1/pi). This is fixed with limiters and has been solved many times before so I'll spare the details. The result is that you can simply add as many fractions as you want and still use just one integer as result, and that's the case when dividing by 9 as much as dividing by any other number. So you can get rid of the 9 and leave just a return after the last number.\n\nYou can replace this whole part, including the limiters, with just a constant.

{"text": "This problem uses the idea of a function.  A function is a way to transform data from one set of data to another.  That is to say, a function tells you what one value will become from a different value.  The function does this in its very name, it is called an \"function\" because it transforms data into something else.\nA function can take any one value and turn it into another value, and it can do this without skipping any values.  There are two different types of data transformations done in this type of problem.  One transformation turns a single row of data into a new row of data, and the other transforms a single column of data into a new column of data.  \nThere are three sets of data that show up in most problems of this type:  1) The first set is the starting data.  In this problem, the data that shows up first is the fish that Ittymangnok caught.  2) The second set of data is the new data that comes after the old data.  In this case, for Ittymangnork, there are the three pieces that are left after there are three more pieces than they needed for themselves, and for their child.  For Oomyapeck, the data in the next row is the fish that he eats.  The fish that he eats is how many fish will each of him get to eat if he eats 22 of his father's eyes.  3) The last type of data is the name of the rows.  In this case the label (also called a row name) is the name of the person who is receiving the data, whether that is Ittymangnorg, Oomyapeek, or the dog.\nThis problem has four data sets.  The first set has three numbers: 1, 2, and 3.  The second set contains three numbers again.  The third set has one number: 22.  The fourth set has the labels \"father\", \"himself\", and \"dog\".  Let's write it as a line.  Ittymangnorf: 1, 1, 1    Oomyapeck: 1, 0, 22    Dog: 1, 7, 0 The only change that we need to make in this problem is from this formula: Number  of  eyes    Itt", "answer": " 4"}

You can measure the total diameter of the pizza (exactly), and, for smaller pizzas, you can measure the total diameter in inches, and the diameter of the \"slice\" of pizza as the \"radius.\" An example of this would be a 14\" diameter pizza with six slices, where each slice would have a diameter of 2.33 inches (radius=2.33). If you cut the pizza in half, you could either measure the entire diameter, or the radius of each half of the pizza, and each method would give you the same diameter.

For the not used we create an array \u2018memorizedChoices\u2019 and an array \u2018availableChoices\u2019 that stores the correct choices for each test case.\n\nThe brute force solution first scans the first word of each test case and stores the corresponding correct choice in the array \u2018memorizedChoice\u2019. It should be noted that we don\u2019t have the list of words that we are searching to, nor do we know the choice that will be given for each word (the answer for each test case should be of the same type). Because of that, we use a switch statement to switch between \u2018letter\u2019 and \u2018pound\u2019, for both upper and lowercase letters of the alphabet and \u2018\u00a3\u2019 (a special character which is a conversion between uppercase and lowercase \u2018\u00a3\u2019).\n\nAfter storing the respective memorizedChoice, we move on to the next test case, scan the next question for the first word in \u2018memorizedChooses\u2019 and store the corresponding choice in another array called \u2018availableChoices\u2019. The way to read and understand these lines and know whether to switch from \u2018pound\u2019, \u2018lower\u2019 and \u2018upper\u2019 should be read as a \u2018memorizedChoice = \u2018pound\u2019, \u201cmemorizedChoses\u201d; \n\nIf we did not store any of these memorized choices the array will be empty or of different type to begin with.

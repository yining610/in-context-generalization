{"text": "1) The question asks us to solve for the final weight of a box full of goodies.\n2) Based on the question, we can make some assumptions about the size of the box and its contents:\n  * The amount of jelly beans was enough to bring the weight of the box to 2 pounds.\n  * The amount and type of brownies added brought the weight to triple.\n  * Another 2 pounds of jelled beans was added.\n  * Gummy worms were added,  the total weight increased to 4 times its original weight.\n3) The final weight of the box can be solved by combining the information from the problem and using our assumptions. We can express this as:\n  * (2 x 2 = 4) + (3 x 3 = 9) + 2 x 12 kg = final weight of box\n4) In the expression, (2 x 2 + 3 x 3 + 2 x 9 g) = final weight of box, the last terms, ((2 x 2) + 9 g), ((3 x 3) + 9 g) is 4 + 9 g and 9 + 9 g respectively, which means the final weight of box is 72 kg.\nSo the final answeed is 72 kg", "answer": " 16"}

Then we can determine the meaning of the words \u2018charges\u2019 and \u2018sales\u2019 in the context of the situation.\n\n1. After determining the context of the question, we can say that the word \u2018charges\u2019 clearly demonstrates that Noah is selling his paintings at a price. Here 'charge' is not being used in the context of money, but as a verb, to sell or offer for sale, or in the sense of charging a fee or price. So the answer to this question is NO, the word 'charges' in the context of the sentence does not mean'money'.\n2. After determining the word 'charges', we can move to the next word'sales'. In the given question, the word \u2018sales\u2019 in context refers to the final quantity of the paintings, as per the sentence, after \u2018he sold eight large paintings\u2019. So, here the word'sales' in context refers to 'large paintings'.\n3. Now, by combining the two terms (Noah charges $60 for large painting) and (and'sold eight large paintings'), we can say that Noah earned $480 in revenue by selling eight large paintings, which is equal to $60*8.\n4. So, now we have the final part of the question; Noah sold a total of twelve (12) paintings in total in this month. If Noah sold twice as much paintings in this month, He would sell a total of 24 paintings this month. Hence the amount of money he makes this month is 2*60*24=$11,520.

So we see Anna gets 14 pieces for 14 houses in the second subdivsion and 75 in total. Now by the given information if Anna gets total 75  pieces of candy,so it means she will get total of 75 \u2013 14 for one house.\n\n3) So Anna will get 14 pieces of 1 house for 58 houses. So if one house is equal to 13 so she will get 80 pieces of candy in total \nwhich is equal to 75 \u2013 75. So the total pieces she will get is (75 \u2013 77). So it is not possible for Anna to get more \ncandy,so she will get less pieces of candy as it is a negative value. \n\nSo the final answer to the question is that Anna does not get 80 more candy pieces than Billy due to the negative value we get.\nSo the final answe to the question that Billy gets less and Anna gets more candy.\n\n\nInput:Ask your teacher to solve 31 + 49.Choices:  A: I can answer the problem if you can first figure out if it can be solved. \nB: I think it can be solved.

{"text": "1) The question is to calculate the price gap between 48 cans and 12 cans at the grocery or the other way around, that is: per case or per can\n2) A case of cans at the bulk warehouse is cheaper than the case at the grocery, hence the per case price gap is: $12.0 - $6.0 = $6.00 \n3) We have to calculate the per can price gap between 4 cans and 1 can. The equation looks like this: \\({per\\_can\\_at\\_bulk_warehouse}_{48} - {per\\_can\\_at}\\_{12}\\) \n4) To find the value of a number, you subtract its place with its previous place. Here, per can at bulk warehouse at 48 is multiplied by 12 (48 is multiplied with 12 because 48 cans contain 12 cans in a case) hence the value of per_can_at_bulk_warehouse_48 is \\(60\\) hence by subtracting 60 with 60 you get 0. \n5) Hence the formula for Per Can price gap at bulk warehouse \\({per\\_can-value}\\) at 48 is ${per\\_can-value} - 0$ = $0$.\n6) To find the price gap at a grocery per can, apply the same formula \\({per\\_can}_{12}/{per\\_can}_{48}`.

To begin with, we need to identify the type of data that the problem describes: \nQuantitative data:\nNumber of weasels: 100 \nNumber of rabbits: 50 \nDifferent pieces of information expressed in numbers.\nNon-quantitative, or categorical data:\nNumber of foxes: 3 \nCertain types of information is represented using words or categories instead of numbers.\n2. First, we have to convert non-quantitative data to quantitative data, and the conversion will be like:\na. Number of foxes: 2 foxes for the first week, 3 foxes for the second week and 4 foxes for the third week.\nb. Number of weasels killed: 1 weasel for the first week, no weasel for the second week and no weasel for third week.\nc. Number of rabbits killed: We can assume that a weasel kills one weasel and two rabbits and a fox kills one weasels and two rabbits. \n3. Next, we have to calculate how much weasels or rabbit killed in each week. \nAs for the calculations:\nRabbits killed: 3 foxes X 2 rabbits (for first week) + 3 foxes X no rabbits + 4 foxes X no rabbit (for second week) + 4 foxes x no rabbit (for third week) = 11 rabbits total killed in 3 weeks.\nWeasels killed: 3 fox X no weasel + no weasle + no weasles = 0 weasels total killed in 3 week.\nNow we have the quantitative data, we can use the basic mathematical formula: = (((total number 1 * rate first week) + (total number 2 * rate first week) \u2026 + (total number n * rate nth week)\n4. To summarize, the total number of weasels after 3 weeks is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 weasel total left after 3 weeks.\nAlso, the total number of rabbits after 3 weeks = 11 + 11 + 0 = 22 rabbits total left after 3.\nSo the final answers are weasels =", "answer": " 96"}

Class A (40% of the total number of students) contains as many students as class B, so this is the group with the maximum number of students. 3.) Class A's minimum group is 40% of 80, so its minimum number of students is 32. It is possible to have an odd number of students, so the minimum number is rounded down to 31 students (1 + 30 = 1.99999\u2026, and this is a decimal rounded as a whole number). 3. Class B was said to have 21 students fewer, so class B's number must be greater than class A, so it will be as large as its maximum number of students minus its minimum number, which will be 38 - 31 = 7 students.\n4.) The rest of the students must be in class C in order to have 80 - (31 + 7) = 22 students in class C, plus the total number of students. So, the total number of students can be written as follows: 40% of students are in class A which has 31 students, class B has 7 students, and the rest (22) are in class C. 5.)

{"text": "To answer this question, it's crucial to understand the variables in the question, namely 'a year ago,' '2/5 times less,' and 'current cost.'\n\n- A year ago (1 year back) is the baseline year in the given expression, after which we must understand what has changed to be able to derive an expression for the current cost.\n- 2/5 times is an expression used to show the proportional relationship between the first year's cost (a year ago) and the current cost (which is the second year cost). This expression shows that the current cost is 2/5 times that of the year ago cost.\n- Lastly, the current cost of a lawnmower today is the answer that we seek.\n\nNow, putting the understanding of variables in context, we can say that the current cost is the 2nd year cost, which was 2/5 of the 1st year cost.\n\nSo, using our understanding of variables and context, we can write the current cost as 1/15 * (the cost that was 1 year ago).\n\nBy substituting the current cost value in here, and solving for value of 4 lawnmowers, we get - 1,800 * (4 * 1/15).\n\nBy dividing both sides by 1800, we get 4 * 1/329 = $678.73\n\nSo the final answer to the question is $678.", "answer": " 10080"}

Lilith comes up with the idea of reducing the price of her bottles from $2 to $1.80 because that\u2019s as low as she can go. She takes the number 504 and multiplies it by 1.80 because each water bottle that she carries costs $1.80.

The store, however, is selling their water bottles at a regular price of 1.85 but Lilith realizes that she can get the same number of water bottles for the same price at her store. So, she comes back with her water bottles still at the original price of $2 when she bought them. The total cost of this scenario then becomes 1049, since 385 has been added to the cost of the original 504 bottles.\nIf Lilith is trying to sell her last remaining 24 bottles of her water at the same price she would have sold them at before the reduced price, she can only sell 18 bottles, so she has 6 left over. Therefore, the total number of her water bottles that she can sell is 94.\nLilith now wants to find the total cost of selling all her bottles to get the same amount of money.

What is the error?\nOutput:1) When a programmer runs the code, they expect it to run properly without any errors but are often met with errors or in this case 'Error: no suitable way t continue in this program'.\n2. To understand the error, we need to examine the code, the error, as well as other possible causes for this error.\n3. Examining the code and seeing that the error says \"Error: no suitable, we can conclude that the issue with the code is not due to missing semicolons, a syntax error between two different language codes, a missing comma or full stop, or a syntax error between two languages.\n4. From the information we have, we can rule out these potential causes of the error - missing semicolons, syntax error between two different languages, missing comma or full stop.\n5. When we evaluate whether the code was correctly executed and does not have any errors within it, there are still two other potentially relevant causes of the error.\n6.

This would equal another round of 3,000 miles multiplied by 420 gallon miles. This would equal 12,880 gallons of additional fuel.\n5. - Crew fuel also increases by 3 gallons, equaling another additional round of 3,300 miles multiplied 85 gallons (because each crew member used 3 gallons more while in flight). This equals an additional 28,450 gallons of fuel.\n6. - Bag fuel also increases by 2 gallons, equaling 1,520 gallons of extra.\n7. - With this information, we can find the total number of gallon the plane will need for the 400 mile flight in 2 ways:\n8. - First, we can use the equation for determining the total of anything: n(n+1):\n9. - 3,900 (420+3,300+1,520) = 14,140 gallons total.\n10. -  Alternately, we can use the multiplication equation for determining the number of things: 400m x 1,540 = 620,000 gallons.\n11. -  Therefore, we can conclude that the 14,130 gallons or 620,860 gallons of fuel are needed.\nSo the final number of gallons of Fuel after all the multiplication which is 620, 860 are the final answer.\n\n#### For the second question: \nWe can see from the example above, the question has this structure", "answer": " 106000"}

There fore there is a total of 2 swimming hours and 1 running hours.  So 100% of swimming is 12mile( 4 miles per hour)*2.  And 100% run is 16 mile per hour. So swim is 1/2 the run, we have to take away the amount of time it takes per mile to run. Which is 1/16. So if we add 5, we get 16+5=11mile.

You are standing at the end of the table, and there is a box of crayons on the table, in which there are 2 red crayons and 4 green crayons. In what color can you get a box full of 2 crayons?\nOutput: 1) To answer this question, it's important to note the word 'full' in the question, which indicates that the number of crayons needed equals the number of crayon boxes received.\n2) The word 'box full of 2 coryndon's' refers to two different combinations of red and green 2 crayons, for example: 0R0G & 0R1G. Thus, in order to receive a box full of 0R0G, 0R1G, 1R0G, 1R1G, we can choose 2 crayon pairs (i.e. 0R1G & 1R0G) and 2 empty boxes (i.e. box G & box G)\n3) Therefore, the final answer can be 2R0G, 2R1G, 0R0G and 1R1G combination.\nSo the final\nanswer\nis A: [2R0G], [2R1G], [0R0G] and [1R1G]", "answer": " 4"}

This can be re-written as:\n          B = C - 3\n   - By adding up the expressions for bucket A and bucket, we can find that the total number of items in buckets A and B is:\n           A + B = 4 + (C - B) = 5 + 1 = 6\n\nNext we need to determine the total number of items that bucket C contains. We know from the question that bucket C contains 9 pieces of fruit. Since we already know the total number of items for both buckets A and B, we can use substitution. If bucket A contains 4 more fruits, then bucket A contains:\n       A = B + 1\n       Substituting in bucket B, we get:\n       Bucket A contains 1 more fruit than bucket B\n      And:\n       B = 3 + 1\n       Bucket A = 4 \nHence, the total number of fruits in all 3 bucks is:\n       A + B + C = 4 + (5 + 1) + 9 = 20\nSo the final answer for the total number of fruities is: 20", "answer": " 37"}

This equation might look something like this:\n\n$9=x+20$\n\nThis equation would help us to find the price of the clayer pot, which then can be subtracted to the price of the flower, to get the cost of having the flower.\n\nTherefore, to have the flower, it costs $9, which is equal to the price of the clatter pot, then subtract the price of the bag of soil. This equation would like such as this:\n\n$20-2=9$\n\nSubstituting for $x$ and for $y$, we get that\n\n$20=x+y$\n\nand\n\n${9=x-(y+2)}$\n\nCombining these equations, we will solve for $x$.\nSolving for $x$, we have that:\n\n$10=x+9$\n\n$2=10-x$\n\nCombining the two equations, we have that:\n$2=x$\n\nTherefore, the clay pot is $2$ dollars. \n\nFrom here, to solve for the flower, we would only need to subtract the clay pot from the price of the flower.\n\n$9-2=6$\n\nHence, the cost to plant a flower is $6 dollars.\"\nSo the final answer will be $6 dollars.\n\nInput: The next letter is in the fifth position if the next letter is", "answer": " 45"}

What are the numbers?**\n\n### Notes\n- For questions that rely on addition or subtraction, it's crucial to pay attention to the operations being performed. Remember that a question where no symbols were mentioned usually operates using the operation whereby the two quantities are written next to each other (ex: adding, subtracting). Also, keep an eye out for the context and wording used in the answer choices. The given options are not always consistent with the question, even when they are similar.\n- Be wary of the order in which different quantities are compared in mathematical operations. For example, if the question reads \"which of the following is the highest?\", it is important to check whether the quantity with the largest value or the one with the least value is being compared.\n- In questions that involve solving for a given value or finding the difference between two given values, make sure to check the units of measurement, rounding, and the possibility of division by 2, 0, or 1. The use of unit conversions and rounding can make a huge difference in the answer choice.", "answer": " 34"}

To answer this, we need to remember the basic concepts of multiplications. Here are some rules to follow when multiplying multi-digit numbers:\n   - Remember that \"1\" is the place value of a unit digit and \"10\" is the place value for a two digit digit. \n   - The product of two multi-digit numbers is a multi-digit number. Multiplying multi-digit numbers results in a product that has the same number of digits as the longer of the two factors. For example 66 x 145 is 9,895, which is three digits in length. Since the number 776 has more digits in it than 145, the product 776 x 146 is 112,396, which is also three digits in length. \n   - When multiplying multi-digit by multi-digit you can multiply the two digits separately if they have the same number of digits. And to find the answer of the bigger digit you multiply the two digits together (with carry over) \nSo lets calculate these questions:\n   - How do we get to this: 367 x 232 = 83069.\n   - 651 x 342 = 22,088 \n   - 671 x 446 = 30,148", "answer": " 600"}

{"text": "1) Head-Start refers to Bob's time advantage, as he already travels 1 mile and catches up to Jim. \n2. Given that Bob runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour and Jim runs at a speed of nine miles per hour, we can use the formula distance = speed * time to calculate the distance travelled by each of them. \n3. For Bob whose initial distance is zero, distance travelled = 1 * 6 = 6 miles, for Jim distance travelled = 0 * 9 = 0 miles. \n4. If 't' is the time taken by Jim to catch up to Bob, then we have the following equation: d = s*t. \n5. Substituting the values for distance, we have the following equation d = s * t. \n6. Now, as per the question, the initial distance of Bob is 1 mile (6 miles per hour) and Jim's is zero. \n7. Thus, distance of Bob in the second equation can be substituted as 1 mile (d = 1* 6). Distance of Jim is zero (0* 9 = 0). \n8. Therefore, the equation can be reframed as: s * t = 6. \n9. When s = 6 (it represents the speed of running) and t refers to time taken. \n10.

Therefore to catch up to Bob in time t, Jim will have to run at a speed of 40/t miles per hour (s = 40/t) where t represents the time taken by Jim in minutes, and (6 * 40/t =36) to cover a distance of 6 miles in t minutes. \n12.

But bonds aren't an asset. Bonds aren't an example of an asset. Thus, bonds aren't a monetary asset.\n4: Cash. Cash comprises all currency in circulation, such as $1 bills, $20 bills, coins, and so on. But cash isn't an asset, a monetary asset, or a financial asset. Instead, cash is a liquid medium of exchange that is mainly used in the process of buying and selling goods and services.\n5:Digital currencies. Digital currencies are virtual assets whose value is supported by a cryptographic ledger that is transacted and secured by a system of nodes and miners using blockchain technology. Hence, cash isn't a monetar asset.\nSo the final answers are 4: cash and 5:digital currency\n\nInput: What comes after the 2013, 2014,2015, etc?

In this case, the whole number is 'total', which will be the sum of the snowballs made by both Janet and her brother, i.e. 100.\n2. From the given choices we have:\n   - A is 20%. This means that 20 out of the total amount is that of Janet. Since she made 50 snowball, we know that 20/100 = 50/100, or 20% of the total snowballs were made by Janet. But the total number of snowballs made by Janet is irrelevant here.\n   - B is 40%. This means that Janet made 40/100 or 40% of total snowballs. Since the total number is irrelevant, we can say that Janet made 120 snowballs in total. This means that 40/120 is 33.33%. But this is not the answer.\n   - C is 70%.

The variables are 'number' and 'type' i.e., number of men, women, and children. \n3. After determining which variables are fixed, and which can vary, the next step is to work on finding the answer. Here, the following two scenarios can be considered:\n   -1st scenario: The event had 40 men, half of the number of men were women, and the rest were children. Now, 10 more children are added, there must be 60 children at the event.\n   -2nd scenario: The event had only 30 children, 10 more were added. So, altogether, 40 children attended the event.\n4. Therefore, to answer this question, it's necessary to consider both scenarios and make a comparison to see which one is more appropriate for the given data provided. From the provided data, scenario 1 is more probable given that '40 men' has already been confirmed to be true. Further, the number of children present in the event cannot go less than half the number of men present as stated by the given data of 40, which is why only 30 is a possible scenario.

Using basic multiplication and division, we can solve this problem and get our answer.Let's start by looking at the statements one by one.\n1. Mark has a garden with flowers of three different colors.\n2. He planted plants (flowers) that have ten yellow flowers, and there are 200% more of those yellow plants (flowers) than there are purple ones. \n3. However, there are only 25 percent as many green flowers as yellow and purple ones.\n4.

{"text": "1. Let's first find the total number of hours of work per week. This is 50/5 = 10 hours per day \u00d7 5 days = 50 hours per week. \n2. We can identify the amount of money earned per day of work as $18.08, which is calculated using the following equation:  $18.0 \u00d7 (10/24):\n   = $18.0 per hour \u00d7 (10 hours per day / 24 hours per day) = $18.16\n   = $17.66 + (17.66\u00d71/2) = $18 \u00d7 (10/12) = $17.92\n3. From there, we can find how much was earned every day as follows: $18.1585172 per day\n4. Now, when multiplying the total earned per day (which is $18.1 \u00d7 5) by 5, we arrive at $90.5 per week.\n5. We can calculate how much her total earnings would be in a week after the overtime was calculated in the same manner. The following equation can be used for such a calculation:  (18+17.92)/0.5 = 90.5\n6. We can also identify the amount of total bonus earned in overtime as $87.45. For example, if someone earns their regular pay of $17.9 per day for 20 days, they will receive a bonus of about $87.4 for overtime in a month. It is calculated as follows: $17.9 * 20/24 = $35.8\n7. The total amount of bonus earned through overtime is $87.4, which equals (18+18)/0.5 = $90.\n\nSo, the final result is The total pay earned per week when a person works 50 hours per work is $90.5, which equals the total of regular pay and overtime pay.", "answer": " 990"}

{"text": "To find the total amount earned by Lee, we need to consider the following: 1. Lee mowed 16 + 3 = 19 lawns. \n2. When a customer tips, the tip is given directly to Lee, so it is a bonus for the job done, and is not considered when calculating the total for the job.\n3. Therefore, $10 tips for 19 lawn mowing jobs means $10+10+10 = $30.\n4. Lee charged $33 for each lawn mowing job, plus $30 in tips, means the final payment given to Lee was $33 x (19 - 1) = $633 - $30 = $603. This implies that, out of the 19 lawn jobs, one was done for free, one extra job was done, and an extra $10 tip was given.\n5. Hence, $10 for one lawn + $10 for one tip + $13 for extra lawn = $10 + $13 + $10 = $33, which is the price Lee charged for the extra job.\n6. It is understood that when extra tips were given, Lee gets the entire sum since the $30 would be added to his final payment as mentioned. However, in this case, the $30 + $33 = $63 extra payment is considered as the extra amount that was given after the payment for the job with the $30. \n7. Thus, $603+$33 = $603+36 \u2260 $639.

{"text": "1. The question is asking for the average number of books that Krystian borrows in a week if the libraries is open from Monday to Fridays.\n2. We can approach this question using the relationship between 2 numbers: the average and the sum. Hence, let's start by formulating the relationship between the 2 variables first.\n   - Daily average: average = (40 + 40 + 4 + 3 + 10) / 5 = (40 +100)/5 = 60\n   - Total borrowed books: total= 60 * 5 = 300\n3. So, our formula can be described mathematically as:\naverage = sum/5 = (300)/5 =60\n4. Now, let's analyze each choice in the question:\n\nInput: Krystian borroes 40 books on every da. What is the sum of the first 40 days in a month? Choices: \nA: 3600 B: 2880 C: 1480 D: 0 E: 3120\nOutput: 1) The first part of the question asks for an approximation of how many books Krystian borrrows in a month. We can find the summation of a set of numbers with an average by multiplying the average by the number of items in the set.\n2) Since the average of the 40 days is 40 books, the answer for the first part of the question is 40 * 40 days = 1600.\n3. Given this information, we can now examine each option in the question.\n\nInput Which is bigger: 999 hours, 2000 days, or 100000 months? Choices: A: 1000 days B: 100 months C: 100 days D: 10 days E: 1 months\nOutput:  1. The question asks us to compare the number of hours worked, the number of days taken to complete something, and the number of months needed to complete something.\n2. Hours worked:  999 hours is the equivalent of 43.5 days.\n3. Days taken to complete something: the shortest", "answer": " 216"}

{"text": "1:  The basic logic of the arithmetic calculation can be redefined with a simple formula. If loss is defined as 'x%', for example, the 'double' gain would be 1.2x, where 1.2 is '0.2'. And '0.2' is 20% of 1.\n2: \nIf loss is defined as '20%', then gain has to be equal to 1.20 = 1.2, where 1.0 is the '1.20'. So if Baez lost 20% at first, then her friend gave her 1.20, or double.\n\n3:  However, when considering the statement in the sentence: 'A friend...gives her...double the amount that Baez has after she lost them', the words 'double' and 'after' have two separate meanings.\n\n4:  'After' refers to after 20% of the original marbles were given away, so then Baez received the amount she lost (1.2x) and has a new total of 38.5. The 'after' part of this phrase is referring to after the loss and before the double of the loss. \n\n5:  'Double' refers to just that: double the amount lost. So out of the 25 originally, Baez has now lost 19.5 due to 65% loss. So, when she gives her friend double the amount lost, she receives 18.3% back in the end. Therefore, Baez only received half of what she lost (38.5-18.3), or 20.15.\nSo the final answers are: 20.2\n\nInput:A man, a woman, and a dog take turns running to get a piece of meat.

So the answer is - I don\u2019t know\nSo the final answer if 'I don't know'\n\n####################################################################\n### Instruction:Answer the question below, explaining your answer and answering why you chose that answer.\n\nInput:What does it mean to see into the future?\nOutput:\n\n- The expression is used to mean that a person possesses knowledge or understanding of an outcome that will be determined solely by time.\n- It simply means that a person can predict or know what the future holds, without any external influences.\n- The phrase is typically used to refer to a supernatural or mystical ability, which cannot be achieved through normal means, indicating it is not true.\n- However, I disagree with the above as it doesn't follow the given question at hand, rather it tries to provide an answer that fits all possibilities. This is not what the question is asking for.\n- To address the first possibility, if I see into the future, the future can not be changed as long as I have that knowledge. This is clearly untrue.\n- To address, the second possibility, a person may gain knowledge through various means including studying the past. To be able to change the future, I don't require supernatural or mystical abilities as the result can be achieved by ordinary means (e.g studying the past).\n- Finally, for the third possibility, if I know I can not change the future, than seeing a possible (in my case, predicted) future would not satisfy the condition of being able to see it.\n- Therefore, the ability to see into the future is possible through normal means, such as studying past events. That can not be achieved without knowing how the future will turn out.\nSo the final sentence is: If I can see into the future, that means that there will be things that can be predicted and will not be affected when changes are made. Hence, the ability to see the future does not mean the future cannot be changed.\n\n\n###########################################################\n###", "answer": " 16"}

The total time required to complete the tour would be 37.5 hours which can be found by first, we need to figure out how much time the bus will take on each trip(or the two trips).\n2. We can calculate the difference between each time by,\n   - distance between stop 1 and stop 2 is 55 miles so if it will take 2 hours for a person to drive it, it will take 2/55 * 4 hours = 0.4 hours.\n   - difference between stop 2 and the final stop is 10 miles which will take 1/10 * 4 hours =0.4 hours. So the total difference between the stops will be 0.8 hours.\n3. the bus can drive at a speed of 1 mile per 2 minutes and it will make it 48 trips.

{"text": "As per the question James sold his $20000 car for $16000 which leaves him $4000.  Now he has $4000 to buy his new car but he can buy a new car at 80% of $30,090.  But he bought it at $24000. Let us get a fair idea regarding the percentage we saved.\nThe first thing to note is that his car was worth $2000 and now he is buying at $24090, as you see that he bought it at 90% of cost of $30,900. Now we need to find out where he went wrong with calculation.\nThe cost of the car = $24095(90% of cost) - $5945 (80% of cost)\nThe above answer shows that now we save $18145. So total amount he spent is $4000 + $18143 = $22143. So total percentage of savings is 75.08%.", "answer": " 11000"}

For the crates, we can set up our equation like so:\n     12x + 0 = counter\n    This equation states that 12x crates contain zero pieces of fruit (the number of fruit in each crate must be smaller than the number of crates themselves), but the total number of pieces in all 12 crates adds up to the variable counter, which we can calculate to find this value.\n  2. For the boxes, we can set up the equation like so:\n        30x + 0 = container\n    This equation states the same as our first equation, but since it is for the boxes, the total number of pieces is counted up to a variable counter.\n3.Now that we have set up our two equations, we can use the logic that the total number of pieces from each group added together must equal the number found in the variable counter.\n  3. Therefore, solving the equation from the crates, which adds up to counter with a coefficient of -12, we can arrive at 315, which is correct.\n  4.

After dividing by 3, we get replacement'replacement size' = 200 (rounded off to the nearest hundred).\n5. But the total length of the fence is 640, which is 2 times greater than replacement'replacement size (200). 'We are required to replace 200 feet more than what was there before. This means we just increase the replacement size to 400 (which is 200 + 200). \n6. So the correct answer is replacement size = 400\nSo the final answer D is 400", "answer": " 80"}

If the winner of the first round is the first to compete in the second round, and the winner of the second round is the third to compete in the third round, what was the winning order of the first, second, and third rounds of competition?\nOutput: To answer the question, we can use the information given in the question. The first round is a standard competition round, where the competitors compete in random order. However, we can assume that the winners of the first round won in a reverse order. Hence 1) The first round winner competes in the reverse order, 2) The second round winner competes in a random order, 3) The third round winner competes in reverse order again.\n\n1*Relevant Information:\n\n-The competitors win in a reverse order. So we can assume that 1st compete 3rd and 2nd compete 2nd.\n\n-The order can also be represented in reverse chronological order. 3rd, 1st, 2nd.\n2*Explanation:\n\nSo, now, we have to predict the winners in the second and third rounds after taking the order of first round. \n\n2*Winners in 2nd round:\n\nAfter knowing that the winner of the first-round is competing 2nd in 2nd round, we can get the 3rd-place winner by using the given information.

OR, Jim could have 3 different cars representing 3 makes each (Buick, Ford, Chevy), or 2 cars representing 2 makes each (Blue and Brown colors)\n3. One thing we do know is that Jim had 4 cars more Buicks than Fords.  This means he had exactly 4 Buicks and 4 Fords.\n4. Furthermore, we also know Jim had 3 more Fords than Chevies. If we say Jim had 4 Fords, then we can say that he has 5 Fords in total.\n5. To answer the question, 'How many Buicks does Jim Have?' we are using the information that Jim has exactly 4 Buicks, and 5 Fords.

There are twice as many second-grade teachers as there are first-grade teachers.  There are also six third-grade teachers. Together, there are 22 boys with 17 of them in second-grade. And together, there are 28 girls with 13 of them are in second grade. If each second-grade teacher has either boys or girls in their class, how many of the six third-grade teachers only have boys in their classes?\nOutput: 1st step: We know there are 22 girls. From there, we can subtract the total number of boys to find how many boys there are. There are a total of 17 boys in second grade. That means there are at least 5 boys in third grade that are in second grade.\n2nd step: We can take the remaining 6 third grade teachers and subtract the total number of students they have in order to find how many students they have and if there are boys in their class. 5 of the teachers still have at least one student left over. If there are boys in all of the remaining classes then the total number of boys are divided by two (13+13=26).

{"text": "1: To solve this question, we need some basic information about the context: Farmers who are farming chickens are growing them for meat or egg production. When feeding chickens, they need to provide them with an adequate and balanced diet for them to grow healthy and strong. Thus, farmers will give the necessary number of chickens a diet that can be enough to satisfy their nutritional needs, but not more than necessary. \n2. So, the question is asking about the number of chickens Lao sold.\n3. To answer this question we need three pieces of information that we have:\n    * Lao wants to make a profit of $65 from selling chickers.\n    * Each chicken costs $1.50\n    * Each bag of chicken feed is worth $2.\n4. First, let's find out how much profit Lao gets from selling each chicken;\n    $$ Profit = Sell Price - Buy Price $$\n    $$ Profit(chicken) = 1.50 - 0.50 = 1 $$\n5. Now we have our profit information for selling a single chicken; Lao has got to know how much profit he'll get from selling a batch of chickens - i.e, how much profit he's got to earn from selling a batch that contains at least a profit of $63.00\n   $$ Profit(batch) = (1.50 -0.50) *x = 1.00 * x \\implies Profit(batch)= 63.00$\n6. So, we now need to know how many chickens Lao has to sell in order to earn at least $63 profit;\n    $$ 63 = 1.5(x)$\n\n7. Thus, Lao will have to sell at least 40 chickens to earn $63.0 profit\n8. For each individual chicken, it uses 2 pounds of feed, and Lao sold 40 of these. Thus, he sold 40 chickers, and feed consumption for these chickers is 80 pounds.\n9.

It's important to note that the word 'then' is used to indicate future consequences or conclusions. The grammar in this question states that if a tree has four legs then it is a table, which implies that the outcome of the condition (if a tree has four legs) leads to the conclusion (then it is a table). 'If...then' is a fundamental logical form used to describe the relationship between a condition and its outcome.\n2) This grammar is incorrect. The word 'then' is not used to indicate future consequences. So it would be appropriate to change 'then' to 'then if' to indicate that a future consequence is related to a condition.

The question is then asking what amount of these 73 remaining sheep wander and remain lost in the wilderness. Therefore, we have 73 (remaining sheep that wander) subtracted by the amount of sheep the dog rounded up (90%), which leaves 64. \nSo the final answer from this is 64\n\nInput: John can play 9 holes of golf in a 6 and a half hour timeslot.  What's a timeframe when he can play 18 holes?\n\nOutput: 1) We assume that we'd be playing in the same time-slot, as we all know that playing golf is not something that is done in minutes only, it takes a whole time-slot. So, here the question is asking John to play 18 holes of golf in a same timed slot. \n2) John can play 9 golf holes in a 6 and half time-slot. That means his average time for playing a hole is 10 mins. \n3) We'll assume a ratio of 2:1 (9 : 18). Thus, the time he takes to play 18 hole of golf is 10X9 = 90 minutes. \n4) If we take the time remaining to play 18 and add it with the time already played, then it won't add up. So, we simply do 90 - 6 and a half hours to play 18 whole of golf = 1:59:50 hrs.

To do this, we first need to determine how many seagulls will be scared away. To accomplish this, we must first calculate the 1/4 of the total population the kids will be able to scare away. To determine this, we know that 36 is half of 72, and the problem states the kids will scare away 1/4 of seagulls away. Therefore, the kids will screech away 4 birds, 1/4 of 36.\n3) Next, the next step is to determine how many seahawks will go to McDonald's Lot. First, let's calculate what percentage of the remaining population will go to McDonalds Lot. To accomplish this, first we must calculate what is remaining on the top of the roof of taco's bell. To determine that number, we must start by determining how many will stay by using the total and the amount scared away.\n3) We know that, by scaring away 1/4, the amount on top of the taco bell will be 32 seagulls.\n4) Next, we want to take how many will go to McDonald lot. The problem does not tell us how many, however, it does let us know that 1/3 of them will.\n5) Now, we have how much will remain of the seagull population and the amount that will go to McDonald Lot.

{"text": "To answer this question, let's first understand the context of the question which is a candy shop. A candy shop typically has different types of candy, one of which is a pack of crayons. There are multiple different costs that one pack of crayons incurs, like the cost of production, packaging, shipping, etc.\n1.To begin, we can say that the cost of production is the raw materials and labor costs that go into making a single pack of crayons, such as the cost of the crayon itself, the box, and any other packaging materials. This cost will be constant for all the packs of the same type of crayons bought together at once.\nFor the cost of Shipping:\nThe shipping cost is the expenses incurred to transport goods from the place where they are manufactured to the place where they are sold, such as the cost to transport the packs of candy via a delivery service. This cost is per item but is charged differently based on weight, so the same pack of crayons is priced differently if packaged in different ways, and the price per weight varies between the different options. So we would have to find the shipping costs for each particular pack, then,  add them all to determine the total. \nFor the cost of packaging:\nPackaging cost refers to the expenses involved in creating and sourcing the packaging materials used to package and transport the goods, such as the box itself, the material used to create the box such as cardboard, the glue, and any other packing materials. Again the same pack of candy is packaged differently and the shipping costs are also different. So the  cost for a pack of crayon might be different from the price of shipping that was paid for the same packages of crayons.\n2.To summarize the concept:\n1. The cost of production is usually calculated per item but does not change \n2. The shipping cost is per weight of the item, but it is different when transporting different quantities of the same item.\n3. The packaging cost is also per item but the type of packaging material used changes according to the weight.", "answer": " 15"}

E: six less\nOutput: 1 : The question asks about how many more bicycles you can purchase on $54 dollars than when you spent 36 dollars?\n2. It is clear, the expression is $540 - $360 dollars. That is, when you were to spend 36 dollars, then you would have 180 dollars left. You can use 180 dollars to purchase 8 bicycles at 22 dollars a piece. That is, each bicycle costs 8 dollars more than it did when you had 36 dollars to spend.\n3.

The options for this question are different ways of saying the same thing. There is no \"six less\", because the expression is 540 - 360, and the expression 540 + 6 is 606, which is greater than 540 by six. The expression 540 -6 is also six more than 360 because six units in positive numbers is equal to one unit in positive numbers.\n6.

The total number of potatoes sold for the full day is 312 kg * 7 kg =22344g.\nSo the final answers are D: 22344 g\n\nInput:When a bride has a good eye, how does her groom benefit? Choices: 1. With the bride\u2019s eyes closed 2. The groom can take her home. 3. By choosing a different wedding anniversary gift. 4. By being able to see clearly. 5. With the knowledge that he\u2019s marrying the right person.\nOutput:The answer would be Choice A.\nSolution:A bride having a good eye is not benefitting the groom. So Choice B is incorrect. \nAlso, choice C does not make sense. If the bride was not having a good eye, the groom wouldn't be able to choose a different wedding anniversario gift.\n\nChoice D is impossible.\nChoice E is also incorrect. The groom has to accept the bride\u2019s eye condition when he marries her, and then he\u2019ll be able to see clearly all the time.\nTherefore, The groom must realize he\u2019s married the wrong person with Choice E.\nSo Choice A: \u201cWith the bride\u2019s Eyes closed\u201d. must be the right answer.\n\n\nInput:When did the war to abolish slavery in the United States begin?

Because they both describe a lesser or greater value compared to another value. In the given question, the question asks what is greater than 4. And since we are sure that it is greater than 4, it must be less than 4. Hence here 'greater than 4' is a lesser expression in relation to 'less than 4'.\n2) 'Greater than' and 'less than' are both words used to compare values. Since we are talking about a lesser or greater number in comparison to some number. \nThe relation of these two expressions in the given case is 'less than 4', which is a lesser expression to a greater expression i.e. 'greater than 10'.\nIn this case as the given number for comparison is 4, lesser than 4 is 4.

{"text": "1. First, we compute the number of miles traveled by both Amoli and Anayet.\n   - Amoli traveled for 3 hours at 42 miles per hour and hence he traveled 3 hours = 3*30 miles which adds up to 90 miles\n   - And similarly Anayet also traveled for 2 hours at 61 miles per hour and hence Anayet traveled for 61*2 hours and that sums up to 122 miles.\n(Notice how we have added the hours traveled by Amoli and Anay at the end)\n2. The question states that the total distance traveled was 369 miles. Now we will subtract this total from the total amount that the two of them have traveled.\n   - 369 - 90 = (369-30)*60 = 448\n   - 3 369 - (42*3) = 12(369-42) = 1276\n\n3. So the total distance travelegod by Amoli and Anatyet is 1276 miles. \n4. To answer the question, we must then subtract the total distance Amoli and Anaty had travelegoed, 1276 from the number of miles Amoli and Anaty still need to travel, 369.\n\n5.

Thus, The Life Journey would be 3 \u00d7 $100, or $300. Similarly, When You Rescind would be $270. As for A Day a Life, I'll go with $150.\n3.) The question also says I bought the CDs to share with friends. It\u2019s up to the reader to decide what \"friends\" means. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s referring to a family of 3 people (mom, dad, and child).\nSo 9 CDs would be split amongst 3 people, which will be $100 per person, or $90 at $50 each. The question says I spent $165 in total, but it\u2019s the equivalent of $325 per person, so I'm not actually meeting this challenge. I\u2019m just sharing these CDs with each of my three family members (whose names aren't even given), and in this scenario, the three of us would spend a grand total of $90 each plus another $65 in total. That's a pretty hefty amount, but it's a cost I'll willingly pay if I'm going to continue to live with these people.

So it can't be the answer to the problem of James deciding when he could start to lift heavy again.\n3. B: The correct question is that, \"At what time James could start lifting heavy again?\", thus B: \"after lift heave\" would be the correct question to answer.\n4.

A: C. B: D. C: E. D : F. E: G. F: H. G: I\nOutput: In order to answer this question, we must understand what a series is. A series is a set of numbers, values, or objects ordered in a sequence and are separated by a single symbol which may be a comma (,), a full stop (.), or a line. We can tell that the given series has at least five choices and hence a comma is the symbol that will be used to define the elements of each choice.\n\nWhen dealing with multiple choice questions, it is essential to read all of the choices presented to you. While this question may seem simple at first glance, it can become significantly more complex if we fail to read the choices presented.\n\nWe can observe here that choice B is separated from choice D by comma and then choice D is separated by choice E in the sequence.\n\nIf B is followed by D then B is not D. There are thus only 4 choices. There are 4 commas in this series which is why the number of choices is 4 not 5.\n\nThe missing choice is E, which is the 5th element in this series. Therefore, the final answer is E: G.", "answer": " 8"}

The Order of Operations is a standardized process for solving mathematical operations, which involves determining the operations that must be used first, second, and so on.\nIn this problem, we can use PEMDAS (which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction) to solve for the Order of Operations technique:\n1. First, we multiply everything together - Nadia walked 18 km, and Hannah walked 9 km. Multiply top/bottom: 18 (9) x Hannah = 81\n2. We then add everything together - Nadia + Hannah = 27\n3. Next, we divide everything - 81 (27) / 2 = 12 1/2 km\n4. Lastly, we subtract everything - 12 1\\2 km - 34 km = 22 km\nSo Nadia walked 12 11/2 kilometers, and Hannah walked -34 kilometers.

So we can know that she bought a total of 10 books (six paperback books and fourhardback books).\n3. The next sentence states 'His brother bought one-third the same number of books' as Sarah and two times the number books she bought. So we can say that for Sarah, one-third as many equals the number of paperback books and two times equals the number of hardbacks bought by Sarah.\n4. Subsequently, we can conclude that for her brother, one-third equals half of the number of paperbackbooks bought by Sarah(10/3=5) and two times equals twice the number of hardbackbooks bought by Sarah (4(2)=8)\n5.

One day, he made 5 gallons and 7 pints. On the same day, he lost 10 pints of liquid. How many pints did he have then?\nOutput:  The businessman's initial supply was 4 gallons + 6 pints = _5 gallons and 6_ pints.  Let P be a pint and G be a gallon. The businessman's daily supply = 0 (5) + G + G + P where 0 is the number of gallons made and P is the number of pints lost.  We substitute that the businessman's initial 6 pints = 0 (1) + 6 P where 0 is number of pints made everyday and 6 is the number of pots lost everyday.  Substituting for P we get, 0 (1) - P*13 = 6.  Simplifying we get,\n0 - P*(13-1) =  6 where P is in gallons.  Thus, we get. 0 - P =  6 and p= number of pints lost.  We get P=0.6   p=6.6   total pints = 0.6 + 6.6, which reduces to 6 + 6  = 12.

Hence, the number of chocoloates Mike ate is '20' \n6) The expression '5 more than thrice' indicates that Jenny ate more chocolates than Mike. \n7) So, we can add 20 and then multiply it by the variable '3': '50 = 5 more than thrrice'.\n8) Hence, to solve this question, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to get '4 = x'; x being the variable.\n9) Therefore, the answer is '4'.\n\n### Your Answers:\n\n\n\n```\nAnswers\n1.

{"text": "1.\n2. Answer is $250 + 0.8 (8 hours) (75) = $250 + $600 = $850\n3. The correct order of operations is the order of precedence for arithmetic operations.  From lowest to highest, these are addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.  Multiplication and division are the same level, and they have the same result as adding exponents and subtracting exponents (both have a 2, both 3's are the same power).  However, multiplication and addition have a lower precedence than exponentiation.  This means multiplication and addition will be evaluated before the order of operation.  So, the answer to the statement above is $250 to cover the base price.  In addition to that, if we have any exponents, or other operation, we then proceed to the subtraction or division operations.  If we have any remainder to be calculated, then proceed to the next operation with the greatest precedence (in this case, division since there's no remainder).  If none, then proceed to the largest operator with the smallest precedence (division since there's no exponent in the end).\nSo the final solution is $250\n\n\n### Task one\n### (1) A problem involving the following instruction was encountered: Bob was playing a game of tennis, against an opponent of equal skill.

Choices: 1. 150 square inches 2. 1500 square inches 3. 150 sq ft 4. 150 cm2 5. 150 dm2 \nOutput: 1) The total area of a room doesn't include the area of the basement and attic, which are not part of the main living space of the house. This indicates that the total area of the house must be less than 150 square ft, which would be equal to the square footage of all of the living spaces plus the square footage of the basement and the attic combined.\n2) The area of a room is determined by multiplying its length by its width, and the square footage of a room can only be greater than one unit. Therefore, 150 sq. ft. is not possible.\n3) The area of a square is given by the formula: A = s^2, where s is the length of each side of the square. To calculate the area of a 150 sqft room, you need to multiply the length (which is not given) by the width (which is also not given) to get the area of the room. Therefore, this answer is incorrect.\n4) The area of a rectangular shape can be found by multiplying its length (in centimeters) by its width (in centimeters), which gives cm^2.

{"text": "1) To answer this question, you need to understand the word pieces in the question. Here 'pieces' refers to 'part' or'slice', so the correct answer is two small pizzas plus one slice of each of 2 big pizzas.\n2) How to calculate it:\n   - If we consider a slice has just the amount required to fill a piece (i.e., it's 1/16 of the big pizza), so in total to eat 2 large pizzes, you need to eat 2 large pieces of the pizza (or (2large) times (1/16)).\n   - Similarly, if you think about a slice as 1/8 of a big pizza (i.e., as a big pizza contains 116 pieces, a slice contains 16 pieces, so we divide, to get 8 pieces), then, if we eat 2 small pizzes, then we must be having 2 small pieces with each.\n3) Therefor, for all total pieces, if we add (2large) + 2(small) + 1large + 1small, in total we get 16.\n4.

In the second column we create a formula to represent the cumulative effect of John's writing (we multiply each day's total by 20, and then sum across the range of dates to get a running total). In the third column we create two separate formulas to show how many pages John has written for book 1 and book 2: FORMULATEXPLAIN FORMEL = B1 + C1 =B1+C1+B2 Book (B1 +C1) = B2 =B1+ C1+ B2 3) John will have written a total of 800 pages by the time he has written three books.  If we assume that each book has 400 pages, then book 1 is 2/3rds of the way through; book 2 is 1/3rd of the way through and book 3 is 1/32nd of the way through. This allows us to break the final formula down to three: Book One: B1 = 2 * (F1 + F2) Book Two: B2 = F1 * (2/3) Book Three: B3 = F1 * (1/32) 4) Putting everything together, the formula for each book is as follows, where F1 = the number of pages John writes, F2 = the cumulative total of the number of pages John write, B1 = 400 pages and B2 = 800 pages.

Then we can rewrite this equation; 27 = 2x and simplify this; 13 = 2x /2 and 13 = x which is 6. 6 meals are the answer.\nSo the  final answer is 6 packages\n\nInput: Angela is a bike courier in New York. She is delivering 27 meals to 6 restaurants and 17 packages for 8 companies. If the average weight of a package is 1.05 kg, what is the average weight of a meal?\nOutput:1) By understanding the context of the question, we can find the answer to the question that asks: What is the average weight of meals if the average weight of the packages is 1.09 kg?\n2) Let's assume the average weight of packages per delivery is 1kg:\na) The packages weight 17kg:\nb) So, the weight of all the packages is 17kg\nc) So, the weight all the packages per delivery is 2kg because the weight is divided by the number of deliveries\nd) So the average weight of a per package is 2 kg\ne) Let's assume that all the food has the same weight on average, 1kg:\nf)So the ratio of all the deliveries to the number of meals in each delivery:\ng) The number of all deliveries divided by the number of meals is 17/6\nh) Then the number of all deliveries/meals in each delivery is 25 kg\ni) So, the average weight of meal in each delivery is 1.06 kg:\nj) So, the average is 1.03kg\nSo the final answer to be 1.03 kg\n<br>", "answer": " 3"}

Based on the information given, he will have spent a total of 7.00 on pansies, 21.00 on the hydrangea and 10.00 on petunia.\n \n4. Since Simon spent 28.50, he will have to spend the remaining 21.50 on the purchase of the remaining items which leaves only 21.5 left for the purchase of remaining items, which means Simon should buy a total of 14.50 worth of items.\n\nLet us assume that the price of each remaining item is 1.00 so, he will have to buy 14 x 1.00 = 13.99.\n\nSo, the minimum total for which the remaining items should cost is 14.00.\n\n5. In order for him to be able to buy the rest of what he needs with his $50 bill, he should divide the $50 by 14.0 which makes 3.57.\n\nSo, he will receive back a change of 3.57 which means in order for him to be paid back his total amount of $50, the total amount of what he has to pay is 25.07.\n\nSo the final answer to the above question is 3.57\n\nInput:It is noon and all the kids in this picture want to go trick-or-treating and are asking their parent if they can.

From the information given in the question, we know that:  \n'Number pages per day = number of days taken to reach finish line'\n6. Let's represent the number of pages per day by variable D and the number of days taken to finish reading the book by variable F.\n7. Therefore, we have the following equation:  \n'1/5 of 20 = 1/5D=D/10'\n8. Therefore, we get that D = 40 pages. \n9. Since Emery and are using 1 copy of same book, then 5D = 5*40 = 200\n10. Therefore, the length of book is roughly 200 pages long. \n11. Since Emery can read five time faster than Serena, she takes '1/20th' of the time it takes Serena, to read the book.\n12. And hence, the number of days it takes Emery & Serena to read the book = 0.5\n13. The final answer is F = 0.5 days\n\nInput: What is a common name for a person who teaches math?

{"text": "To answer this question, first we need to clarify what the question is asking. The question asks us to figure out Jack's total sales revenue if he adds 2 more brownies for $4 each to the items he has already sold. To do this, we need to understand the cost and profit of the items Jack has already sold. Here, \u2018profit\u2019 refers to the amount of money that Jack makes from selling an item after subtracting the item\u2019s purchase price. \n1. The question asks how many cookies Jack needs to sell to make 50 dollars in profit. 2. We can break down our problem into smaller, more manageable chunks.  How much revenue Jack gains in each transaction,  and how many of each item Jack sells in total.  Let's calculate these values one by one. \n3. First, we need to figure out how much profit Jack makes from each transaction. \nThe profit of one brown egg is calculated by subtracting the unit's purchase price from its sale price.  The purchase price is the price Jack paid to buy it, usually at wholesale. On the other hand, the sale price is the price Jack sells it to his customers. Here, the unit's sale price is $3 and the unit's purchase cost is $1. As a result, the profit of one brown egg equals 2 dollars. \nThe profit for one lemon square is calculated as $2, which is $2 from selling each lemon square. \n4. Hence, since the cost of one lemon square is $2 and the purchase price of one lemon square was 2 dollars, the profit from each of those items is 1 dollar. And the total cost of all the items Jack has already bought is 20 dollars. We can write the following formula to describe how much revenue Jack gets from each transaction: R = PurchaseCost - PurchaseSalesPrice, $1 = R, or $50 = 15 PurchaseSalesPrice. If one does a little bit of algebra, one can see R=50, then R=15PurchaseSalesPrice, then PurchaseSalesPrice = R/15, which further makes one realize that PurchaseSalesPrice is equal to $4. We can conclude that if Jack sells 4 more brownies for $1 and sells each of", "answer": " 7"}

But the machine uses special technology to raise 20% of the weights, this make the weights raise to be 120 lbs for every 10 lbs.\n4). And the answer should be:\n   - A is incorrect because the weights feel heavier than 36 lbf when they are being lowered in the machine, because the 10 weights are 10*30+20+120= 230 lbs which is greater than the 36lbs.\n   - B is wrong because the weights feel 22 lbs when lowering. 10 weights times 22 lbs gives 220 lbs, therefore, the machine will increase by 20%, this will make it increase to be 264 lbs(10*10*120), which is greater than 22.\n   - C is not true because the machine will increase by20%. so, the total weight will increase to be 180 lbs(10 lbs times 18) and it will only be lighter than 26 lbs.\n\n5).

{"text": "10 hours\nSolution: The problem can be broken down into two main parts. First, we can find the total weightlifting time for Jones throughout all three workout sessions. To do this we consider the duration of each workout and then multiply it by the number of sessions. In total this adds to 360 minutes (or 6 hours, since there are 60 minutes in 1 hour). Second, we can find the time spent on warming up and cardio for Jones, which means the total time spent on these activities must be subtracted from the weightlifting time. So, the total time spent at the gym for Jones is equal to 360  - 360 = 0 minutes since he cancels out his warm-ups and cardio.  This shows that he spends the same amount of time between weightlifting sessions and that his total gym time is 6 hours. Another way to figure out this problem is by subtracting the total time spent on warm-ups and cardiovascular exercise from the total time spent weightlifting, which is 6 hours. This gives us 0 hour, which is the total time spent at gym.\nSo the final answere is 6 hours\n\nInput:John goes to the gym three times a week, but he only exercises for two hours a week.

Since the given question is: \"A group of people in different (unspecified) states were asked how many (unspecified) people lived in their state,\" it implies that it's not known the number of people in each state that were asked.\n2.

{"text": "1. To answer this math question, let's take a closer look at the given information and formulate an equation that will help us calculate the cost.\n2. In the first statement, it is clear that Martha needs 4 cu of berries and 1.5 cu of heavy cream to prepare 1 quart of icecream.\n3. Then in the other statements, it can be simplified that 9 cu of berries and total of 7 cu of heavy cream is required to prepare 2 quarts of Ice Cream.\n4. And here Martha can prepare 2 types of Iceream which are raspberry(1.5 qt) and strawberry (1.5 qt).\n5. To find the cost of 1qt of each Ice-cream, we can use the formula  Q = m * p\nWhere,\nQ = Quantity = 1qt\nm = 1.5 = Martha's requirement in each of icecream\np = 3, 4 and 5 is the price per cup of Ice-cream.\n6. So the equation for each individual ice-cream comes out to as \"1 * 3 or Q * p\", as the formula\n7. and can be expressed in terms of 'Q'.\n8. Hence the equation of each 'indiviual' ice-cream comes to as '3 * q' which is the cost.\n9. So, to compute cost for 1qt of each raspberry and strawberry ice creams, using the above equation, the cost becomes (3 *3) for 1qt of raspberry ice-cream and (3 * 4) for 1qt strawberry ice-cream.\n10.

To begin, we can observe the given information:\n    - Mark played a total of 20 minutes. \n    - He then rested for 20 minutes before playing more. \n    - During this second period of play, Mark played 35 minutes.\n2. Now, to solve the problem, we must consider the time elapsed with each period of play:\n    - During the first 20-minute play time (Mark played for x minutes, then stopped for y minutes to rest), the elapsed time was simply x + y. \n    - In the next 35-minute play time, Mark played for another 3/4 of the 35 minutes, therefore the total time for that period was 35 3/4 \u2248 45 minutes. Which means that Mark had to be 'on the sidelines' for the remaining 5/4 \u2248 50% of the time. \n3. Therefore, using x + y time for the first 20 minutes, and 3/4 of 35 minutes more for the second 35.5 minutes; the elapsed time for the second 30-minute period is 35.5 * 3/4 = 25.625 minutes + 40 minutes (the initial x time rest period) = 65.625 * 4/5 \u2248 79.0 minutes (rounded to 79 minutes).\n4.

{"text": "1) To solve this question, it's important to note that Seth gave away half of the oranges he started with, which means he bought more than double the number of oranges he started with. Seth therefore bought eight boxes of oranges to start with. \n2) To find how many boxes Seth gave away, we can subtract the number of boxes he bought from the number of boxes he had from the start (8), which will give us: 7/2 boxes = 3 and a half boxes. So, we can say that he gave away 3 and a half; boxes. \n3) Let's recall that we can find how many boxes Sith started with using this: Seth started with 8 boxes. We know that Seth started with 4 boxes, and to get from 4 boxes to 8 boxes (the number he started with), he gave eight oranges in total to everyone. Therefore, Seth gave out: 4+3 1/2 = 7 1/2 boxes. \n4) Now we know how many boxes He bought, how many he had from the start, how many he gave away, and how many boxes he has left.

So, we can write it this way:\n`M + (20 - M) = W`\n4) Based on that, we know that Oscar's training distance will increase in his first week from zero (0) miles to two (2) miles. Then, it will increase by `20-2=18` miles every week, so in the fifth week, Oscar will run for `M + 18=21` miles.\n5) Once we have Oscar's weekly training distance, we can find his starting week by identifying when he first reaches 6 miles in his running. \n6) Let's say it takes Oscar 20 weeks to reach 6 miles, his average weekly training miles will be 6/20 (6/20) which gives us a total of 3/4 miles.\n7) We can calculate this by solving the equation below: `20M = 6+18M`\n\nThe solution of `20M = M+18M` will result in the term `M+18M` as a single variable. \nSo substituting 18M by `3/4`, we get `20M =3/4+3/4`\nThis equation can be simplified by subtracting 6/4 from both terms: `20M - 6/4 = 3/4 + 3/4-6/4`\nRemoving minus sign from 6/4: `20M= 3/4+3`\nAdding two halves of `3/4` to one another: `3/2+3/2= 2`\n`20M - 3/2= 3`\n8) This equation shows us that Oscar's training will start from week 3.

{"text": "Let's break down the answer so that we can understand it more clearly.\n1. This is a long word problem with a lot of information.\n2. We see that Mr. Mark wants to set the record of the most consecutive ropes jump.\n3. The question follows the following format:\n   - There is currently a record of 54,0x (x is a number).\n   - How many ys (y is a number) does he have?\n   - He can jump x times per second.\n4. From this format, we can see that there is a lot of variables in the problem, and we need to work through the different variables to solve it.\n5. So far, the problem is x times 3 = y.\n6. Now that we have x and y, we know that y = x * 3.\n7. Now we know that the question is asking us how many hours will it take to beat the record.\n8. So, the question can be formulated as follows:\n  How many hours will it take for x to be equal to 54?\n\nWe know that because x times 3 will be equal to 5x.\n9. We plug our formula into the above to work it out!\n\nx = 54\n4 x = 6 * 24\nHence x = 12 hours.\n\nx * 3 = 54000\n54 * 3 = 162\n54 * 4 = 216\n54 * 5 = 270\nHence, the hours would be 60, 72, 84, 96.\n\nMark is currently achieving a new record, let's say it is 15,000\n\n51 * 3 = 82\n51 * 4 = 102\n51 *5 = 151\nMark would now have 238,720.\n\nIn other words, Mark can achieve 238,220 jumps in 1 hour.\nSo the final verdict is (rounded off) X = 60h or X = 5h more than Mark's current record!!\n\n\n\n### 83.

In this scenario, this means it provides more caffeine per ounce than the first drink, meaning the second drink has 750 grams per ounce, which is 3x the amount in the first drink.\n4) So, adding the quantities together, we see that John has consumed a total of 3 x (12 x 250 gr) + 2 x 750 gr = 3675 grams of caffiene overall.\n5) Now, we can compare what kind of caffiene pills he intakes:\n   * The first drink contains 12 oz of energy drink which contain 250 gr caffiene and 750 gr of cffiene drink per ounce.\n   * The second drink contains 12 (ounce of energy drink- ounce of energy drink) of energy drink which contain (250 grams + 750 gr) caffiene.\n   * So we can understand from the above two cases that the second drink is more than the first drink. \n6) John has 1 bottle of energy drink which contains 12 ozs of energy drink.\n7) Then, he has 150 grams of extra caffeine for each 1 oz.\n8) Thus, we can conclude that John consumed more than 250 gr. of caffiene, which is less than 3675.\nSo the final amount of caffiene is around 3675 - 250.

{"text": "1:  In order to calculate how many hours Gary worked that week, we need to understand the payment he received. His paycheck would be $696 after subtracting taxes he paid out, which was $284. This leaves him with $85. The amount of money Gary received was not the same as the wage he made an hour. Therefore, to find out how many hours he must have worked, we must look at his pay and taxes. \n2.  To understand the amount earned, first, we have to find his hourly wage. Let\u2019s assume his normal hourly pay is $12. We can find his hourly pay by dividing his weekly pay of $696 by 8, as there are 8 hours in a day. So, $696 \u00f7 8 = $88.125 \u2248 $88. Therefore, the total weekly salary is not $696 but $88. This is because $696 does not represent the total wage, but taxes and overtime. \n3.  Now, to understand the payment, we need to divide $88 by 1.5, as every hour over 40 is calculated at 1.5 times the normal hourly rate. In other words: his normal hourly rate is $12, so every hour after the 8th would bring a pay of $18. So, to find the cost of overtime, we simply use the formula: total weekly salary (40 hours) = $88 * 12; every hour after the workplace exceeds 40 hours. For example, when the weekly salary of the day is $1,248, then the total of overtime pay is (1,248 * 12) = $14,920 (which is more than the total salary).\n4.  As overtime is earned in addition to the normal wage, it must be used to understand the question. We start by multiplying the hourly salary by the overtime rate, for example, $12 * 1.5 = $18 (for every extra hour). The total weekly overtime amount is earned by multiplying the weekly salary by 1.5 (that is: (Total Salary) *", "answer": " 52"}

This is a very straightforward calculation. Note that Mack wrote 1 page every \u00bd an hour on Monday. But, in the overall period of 60 minutes from Monday to Wednesdays he has already covered 180 minutes.\n2) So, his total page count on Monday should be the result of 1 page / \u00bd an hour x 180 minutes = 1 page x 3 = 3 pages.\n\n3) Next, let\u2019s calculate his total page count on Tuesday. This is a bit more complicated, but we just need to plug in the information into our formula. We already know that Mack wrote 180 pages total on Monday. So, he would write 1 page / 15 minutes = 6.66 pages on Tuesday.\n4) The same logic can be used to calculate how many pages Mack wrote on Wednesday. Wednesday covers 180 minutes of time, and Mack already wrote 6 pages on Tuesdays.

This would require finding out the number of people who are interested in football as well as those who are not. \n2)To find out the number of people that are interested in football, we must determine the total number of people who fall into the category that likes football plus the total number of football players: 24(250) = 60 \n(For example, if there are 100 people, 24 of them like football and 50 of them play football, then 24 + 50 = 74 are people interested in football)\n3)Now to represent non-footballers to a particular sports fan, we must find out how many like football out of the total number of people involved: (24/60) * 250 = 100 (for example, if there are only 4 people involved, 2 would like it and 2 would not like it)\n4)Since 100 is the number of people that like football, therefore we expect 100/2 = 50 people play football.\nSo the final number is 50", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "1: To assess the number of gift cards from which Jack must return, let's break down the question into its essential components:\n    \n2. Jack sent 4 gift cards (1 Best Buy and 2 Walmart).\n3. Scammers require 8 gift cards in total (6 Best Buy and 9 Walmart) before Jack runs into trouble with the IRS. \n4. If Jack sends both remaining gift cards, he'll satisfy the scammers' demands and avoid any confrontation with the IRS. That means he's safe as long as he sticks with a single gift card.\nTherefore, it's sufficient to compare 6 and 9 of each type. \n5. For every Best Buy gift card, the scammers ask for 6 codes.\n   - Jack only sent 1 of them.\n   - That means there are 5 other Best Buy gift cards that he should return.\n6. As for Walmart, the scammers demand 9 codes, but Jack sent only 2 of them.\n   That makes it safe for 7 other Walmart gift cards.\n7. Jack can send 12 gift cards (6 Best Buys and 7 Walmart) back, reducing the amount by 2, because he sent 5 more Best Buy cards after he realized he was being scammed. So there's a solution worth approximately $950.\nSo the final amount = 12 and the answer is  worth approximately $952", "answer": " 3900"}

Determine the number of tomatoes given away without considering the total number of tomatets picked which is 127\n        2. We take 127 and divide it by 5, which results in number of tomatoes given per haruto i.e. 25.4(tries)\n        3.

This means that we can subtract the number of shells found by Ed from the total number of shells found to find the number of conch shells Ed found compared to that of Jacob. \n3. So, we know that Ed found a maximum of 4 conchs and Jacob found at least 4 conchs.\n4. Therefore, Ed found at least one conch and at most 4 conchs, and Jacob found at least two conchs and at most 4. \n5. In total, there are eight conchs. \n6. So, Ed found at least 5 and at most 6 oysters (4 + 1 or 4 + 2) and Jacob found at least one and at most 2 more oysters (2 + 1).\n7. This means we can find the total number of shell found Ed + number of shell found Jacob. Hence, all other shells found by Ed do not affect the total. \n8. This leads to the conclusion that Ed collected a total of 4 + 2 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 17 and Jacob collected 19 shells in total.\n9.

{"text": "1. The amount of time Matthew spends making his famous caramel apple cakes can be found by firstly deducing the number of coffee cakes Matthew usually makes and the number of ingredients he uses for each one of these cakes.  By then subtracting the time it takes to assemble the cakes from the total time it takes to make them, we can then determine the total time required for Matthew to assemble the ingredients, bake, and decorate the cakes.\n2. To calculate Matthew's usual production rate in terms of how many coffee cakes he generally makes, start by assuming that he makes four cakes in an hour.\n3. Now, if Matthew makes four cakes in one hour, he uses 27 ingredients. It follows that assuming Matthew uses 27 ingridents, the total time of assembling ingredients would be (4 * 1) + (27 * 1.5) = 18.5 hours.\n4. By using (4 * 1.5 ) + (27 *1) = 11.5 hours. Similarly, by subtracting 18.5 from 11.5 you can find that the time it usually takes to assemble ingredients is 7 hours.\n5. By using (4 + 27) = 31, from the assumption that he uses 27, it makes it 31 cakes which he bakes.\n6. Similarly, it will take 7 hours to bake 31 coffee cakes, therefore. By subtracting 21 from 31 you can find that the number of cakes Matthew usually bakes is 59 coffee cakes.\n7. So, the number of coffee cake he generally bakes is 58 coffee cakes which he bake with a time of baking (7 * 31) = 217 hours.\n8. Similarly, it will also take Matthew 12 hours to assemble the cakes. To find how much time has elapsed when Matthew starts to assemble the coffee cakes subtracting the time he assembles from the total time it normally takes, (13 * 58) = 764 hours.\n9.

(the length is measured in meters, so the second throw would be twice the length that throw 1 is. And this would always be equal to throw 1.).\n\nStep 3: As javelin-throw can be described as the hypotenuse of a right triangle, find its opposite side by finding its hypotenuse.\nBy doing the same for the other two throws we'd be able to find the opposite side of the triangle for both throws.\nStep 4: It is clear that after two throws, the opposite side of each of the two triangles would be the same (equal in value).\nStep 5: It is also clear that, the opposite side of the 2nd two would be half of the opposite side of the first two (because throw 2 is equal to throw 1 and so is throw 3).\n\nStep 6: Thus, the answer to this question would lie somewhere between 0 and the square root of the difference between the opposite sides of the two triangles (which are equal).\nStep 7: To get a more precise value, we'd need to know the values of the unknown answer (e.g. 400 or 600 or any other number) along with the values of the given answers in meters (e.g. given 160 and 1", "answer": " 300"}

First, we\u2019ll work with the two options in the parenthesis:\n2. 2/5 of the three quarters are Pennsylvania state quarters. This means that two of five of Nick\u2019s quarters are Pennsylvania state quarter.\n3. The question then asks us to find how many of the remaining quarters are Pennsylvania state, we divide that same number by 4 and that is our answer: 2/5 of 2/5 of his whole set of quarters, or 2/25, which can also be written as 1/12. When the whole set of quarters of Pennsylvania state is divided by 12, we get 1/12 as our answer.\nSo the 1/5 is 1/5.\n4. Let's now calculate how much of his total quarter collection is in the 2/5 of quarters that are state quarters. We can divide 2/5 of total quarters, 7, by the 1/12 of Pennsylvania state quarters.

{"text": "Here, we need to find how many passengers are on the bus after each stop where people either got on or off the bus. But before finding how many passengers are on after each stop, we need to clearly understand what happens each time someone boards or gets off:\n1. Every time a passenger boards or gets off at a particular stop, the remaining number of passengers on the bus immediately changes by that much.\n2. Before any passengers get on or get off, there were 7 original number of passengers on the entire bus. \n3. So, at the first stop, 7-3=4 passengers got off, and another 5 new passengers got on, which means at the first stop, the number of passengers on the whole bus decreased by 8 (3+5), which is 8-7=1.\n4. Similarly, at the second stop, the original passengers decreased by another 1, which means 7-2=5(for passengers getting off), and 5(for passengers getting on). At the end, the total decrease in people was 5+(5+1)=11.\nBut the remaining passengers (after each decrease) cannot simply equal the number of all the people who got on at that particular stop.

Therefore, after the first stop, \n7-(3+5) = 1\n6. After the second stop, 7-(3+5+5) = 5\n7. Therefore, the total decrease in passengers in the bus was 1+5+5 = 11, which adds up to the original 7 and means that at the third stop, the number of total passengers on the bus changed to 11 because out of the 7 that were on before, 5 had gotten off on the previous two stops and 5+2 had gotten on. \n8.

But the sun itself doesn't travel up or down on the Earth's surface. Rather, its apparent path changes based on the time of year and each person's geographic position relative to the sun. For example, during winter in the northern hemispherethose living there see the Sun travels from east to west, but at this time each person travels in the opposite direction because of the rotation of the Earth. \nBy looking at the options given, it's clear that Choice B: 'South to north' is the correct answer, because the sun does travel South during winter in the northern, but North during summer in the southern hemisphere. \n So the final answer is B: South to north\n\nInput:A mule is in a pasture, chewing on an apple, when a hail storm knocks a horse into the pasture.

Grace charges $6 an hour to cut lawns and she cut lawns for 2 hours more than 63. This means that she mowed lawn for 2 more times than her initial hours (63) which is equivalent to an extra $12 per time, which makes up a total of $24. This extra charge will increase her revenue per hour to $315.00.\n3. Option B: $11 x 9 = $99. Grace charges $11 for pulling out weeds and she pulled out weeds for 1 minute extra than 9 hours which makes up a total increase of $11, hence increasing her per hour income to $120.\n4. Option C: $9 x 10 = $90. Grace charges $9 for applying mulch and she applied mulch for 1 more than 10 hours which means that she applied mulch for one more time which makes up a total amount of $9 as compared to her initial charges. So the new total is $112. \n5. Putting it together, the total amount of money that Grace earned in September is $315 + $120 + $112 = $647.

{"text": "1. To answer this, we need to determine the number of slices cut from each pizza. Here, we know that each pizza was cut into 12 and 14 slices respectively, which means that each pizza in total was cut into 26 and 28 slices respectively. Therefore, we can subtract 12 from 28 to get 16 slices for the cheese pizza, and 14 from 26 to get 12 slices for the Hawaiian pizza, meaning that there are 12 slices left over from the Hawaiian pizza and 16 slices left over from cheese pizza.\n2. To determine how many total slices were there at the beginning, we multiply the slices left over for each pizza: 12 * 12 = 144 slices. There were 144 total slices originally: 12 from cheese pizza and 12 from Hawaiian pizza. Thus, 1/6th of the whole pizza (12/60 slices) were left over from each pizza to start with.\n\n3.To determine how many total slicers were left at the end, we multiply the total remaining slices by the number of friends. Hence, the answer is: 12 *1 and 144 * 2\n4.So, from the above equation, 128 are the total slices left after everyone ate, and 64 were the original slices of the pizza at  to begin with: 64-128= 84, which is 144 divided by 2.\n5.Therefore, we can conclude that there were 84 slices of cheese pizza and Hawaiian pizza that were left over after everyone ate.\nSo the final Answer:\nThere were 84, as we found when we calculated 144 total pieces of pizza to begin with. If we divided that by the number of people, we found that there were 8 pizzas left over after everyone had a slice.\nSo the final answers\nOutput: 8 pizzas were leftover.", "answer": " 11"}

This is because the suit coat's price included $48 (the cost of the suit pants) and a $2 discount for purchasing the suit pants and coat together.\n3. Alexis then had a remaining $16 budget at the end of her shopping. This means that Alexis spent a total amount of $161 and saved a total of $0, while leaving a remaining budget of $16.

The question is asking for the total number of trees on Randy's farm, which is given to be 60 mango and 5 less than half coconut trees. \n3) The first condition given is that the total number of trees must be less than 61, which means that the total number of mango and coconut trees combined cannot be equal to 60.\n4) To satisfy this condition, we'll need to calculate the total number of manga trees on Randy' s farm. So, we'll use the information that Randy has 60mango and 5 less mango trees on his Farm to derive the formula: 60+5= X and X-mango trees=60. Here X is the total number of manges trees that Randy has on his farm\n5) To solve for X, we can cross multiply both sides and solve for X: X=60 so we substitute X with 60 to get 60+5 that=60-10=50 (remember we add 5 more). So, the total number of trees that Randy has is 60 mangoes and 5 more plus coconut trees.\n6) Finally, to find the total number of trees which is not less than 61 as given in statement, we need to subtract the coconut trees from the total amount to get: 60mangoes + 5= 60-5=65 = the total number of trees\nSo there is the final answer is 65\n\nInput:The last part of the year is over.

With this information, we can now calculate the total number of sticks she bought. We know that she bought 9 more trunks than snow flakes and 13 fewer sticks, so we can write the following equation: 13 + 9 = t, where t is the total number of stumps she bought.\n5.

After the 1st through 4th right-hand turn, there were also no turns, and the car was in a straight line.\nHence, during all the turns, the car's movement was straight (and not a circle) through a straight line or curved (turns or no turns).

Finally, we must add the cost of $24 to the price for the 12 tickets bought to find the total price for the tickets.\n$480+ $24 = $504\nSo the final cost of Mr. Benson's tickets is 504 dollars.\n\nInput: How many numbers from 1 to 20 can be formed from the digits 2,3,4,5 and 6, if repetition is allowed?  \nOutput:  1.) The first step in determining the correct answer to this question is identifying the digits (2,3,4,5, 6) being utilized to form numbers, as well as understanding that repetition is allowed.(A method of using repeated digits is called cycling). \n2.) One way of approaching the problem is to calculate the total number of numbers that can be formed by using all five digits, without considering repetition as part of the solution.\n\n3.) To do this, we can start by subtracting 2. Then we can subtract to get 6, but it would be quicker to use multiplication if we convert 2 and 6 into their corresponding power form and it can be calculated using the following formula. \n(5*0) + (5*1) + (5*2) + (", "answer": " 476"}

In other words, let us assume that during one trip, the number of available people who can take part in the trip is the same.\n3.)

According to the information in the question, 12 people in a boat can travel across the lake in six (6) minutes (i.e., 12 people * 6 min/people * 4 trips = 24 min = 4 trips). But, since 12 is the capacity of the boat, it can travel in each trip. In one way to do this is by dividing the number of people by the number of people who can be in their seats within one(1) trip. In this case, if all the people are in their seats, then there are 24 people in the boat.\n5.) Let assume there are people who can sit or remain seated in the boat, then that number will remain the same after each trip.

A full time employee can typically clean one amusement park from top to bottom in an 8 hour shift. How many people does the carnival need to hire full time, to guarantee they can clean up in time for them to open the next day? Choices: 8 B: 180 C: 1216 D: 24 E: 1732\nOutput: 1.- The carnival requires eight full-time employees to clean up in time to open up the next day. We know that it would take one person eight hours to clean the entire amusement park, and the carnival requires eight hours to clean. Therefore, we can calculate the amount of hours it would take for each person to clean a fraction of the amusement park as follows:\nEach person cleans 1/8th of the park in 8 hours\n2:-\nWe can then calculate the total amount of time it would take each person to clean their fraction of the park by multiplying the amount of hours it takes each person to clean their portion with the amount of people we would need to achieve our goal.\nTherefore we require the following number of FTE full-time employees:\n\n3:-\nSo the answer is D: 24", "answer": " 720"}

{"text": "1. First, we need to determine the total number of 'large' animals and the total number of'small' animals. To do this, we convert the number of small animals into a number of pairs of sticks, since each animal would require two sticks to be made. Hence, 3 times 2 sticks is 6. Thus, we know that the total number of big and small animals = 2 + 6, or 8 in total.\n2. Then, we can simply convert this total into the number of sticks of wax needed\u2014which is the required answer. We know that the total number (large + small) equals 8. So, each big-sized animal required 4 sticks, and each small-sized creature uses 2 sticks in total. Thus, the total number of'sticks of wax' used to make each type of animal can be calculated using the formula (Large sticks x Total # of animals) + (Small sticks x Total # animals). This is just 8 sticks of wax.\n3. Therefore, we can conclude that Loreen used 8 sticks of  wax in total for all her animals: 4 + 2 sticks for large-sized animals, and 2 + 2 sticks of wack for small-sized animals. She used the exact same sticks for each kind of creature. So, the total number of sticks (8) should be divided equally - and Loraine used 4 sticks for large animals and 2 sticks for small animals.

Thus, Jolene1 was born in year 1 and Phil1 was born in year +24.

That reduces the birth year for Jolene2 to between +14 and +20, and that gives us the correct birth year range of +14 and +16.\n6) Hence, we have narrowed down the possible answer to +15 or +16.  Since the birth years of the children are consecutive, we know for sure that it is not +15.

Finally, Jake loses half of what is left.\n5. Using these facts, we see that Jake starts off with $5000 in his bank account. \nHe then spends $2880, leaving him with $2120.\nAfter attending the concert, he loses $1840 or a quarter of what's left.\nThus, he is left with $288 or half of what he had initially.\n6.

{"text": "To answer this, it is necessary to follow certain steps, which are explained below.   Step 1: Understand the question and the context: The magazine is normally priced at $34 for the 18 month subscription, but with the current promotion, it is $0.25 cheaper per twice-a-month (half yearly) issue. Therefore, the monthly cost of the normal subscription will be $0.375 instead of $0.75 for the promoted subscription.Step 2: Construct a working equation to estimate the value of the promotion: We can construct a working equation based on the information provided in the question. The formula for calculating the promotion value can be derived as follows: Promotion value = 0.25 x (18 x 2), which equals $12.75.Step 3: Substitute the actual values into the formula, and then evaluate the result: The actual values of the cost of the normal subscription and the promotion value are $34 and $12.76, respectively. Therefore, the value of the promotion is $12.7.Step 4: Explain why the actual value is close to the estimated value: The estimate of the promotion value was within $1, which is close enough to reflect an accurate estimation. \n\nSummary The final answer is D: $12.7", "answer": " 9"}

The conversion factor between pounds and cups is: 1 lb = 2 cups 3) Angie bought 3 lbm. of coffee, and each lb. of coffee will produce about 40 cupr. of coffee, we can say that one pound of coffee will brew 40 cups 4) Angie drinks 10 cupr. of bcofea daily.\nIf Angie buys 3 lbm. coffee and each lbm. of coffee brews 40 cups, then every cup of coffee that Angie uses represents a little over 1/4 pound of coffee. 5) Therefore, Angie drinks 40 cupr, and the pounds of coffee that she uses equals 40/1 = about 40 pounds of coffee daily.\n6) We need to find how many days this quantity of coffee will last Angie. The answer can be found by using the formula below:  Number of days = (Quantity of coffee lasts for) days  Angie bought 3 lb. of coffee  (This means her supply of coffee lasts for 3 days)\n7) We therefore get the following answer: Number of days = 3( 40/34 pound of coffee )  Quantity of coffee ( in the 3 lbm. she bought ) = 35.5 lb.\n8) Therefore, the answer to the question is 35.5/3 days, which equals about 12 days.\nSo the final outcome is A: About 12 days\n\nInput: If I eat 2 sandwiches, what do I have?

The third step is to find the cost of the remaining change. The change is the difference between the total cost and the remaining cash on the hand. Therefore, the cost of the remaining balance is $14 - $40 = -$26.\n4. The final step is to find the total cost of the remaining balance, which is the cost of the change.

{"text": "1) First, let's break down the problem into the essential steps we will be using to solve this question:\n   - Compute total cost (TC) for Austin to buy seven robots. This is done by multiplying $8.75 (price of each robot) with 7 (number of robots).\n   - Austin was charged $7. 22 total for tax on the seven robots he bought.\n   - Compute change (C) for Austin. This is done by subtracting tax (T) ($7. 22 tax) from TX ($15.97 tx).\n   - Subtract change (C) from total cost (TC) to get the original amount (EAUS) from Austin in the game.\n2) Now, here is how we perform the calculation:\n   - Let's start by computing the change that Austin receives in the end. This can be done by using the formula: C = T - TX.\n    Where, C = change, T = total tax (7.22), TX = total cost (15.97).\n   - So given these values, let's plug them into the formula: C = 7.22 - 15.97.\n    - So the change that Austin receives at the end of the game is -$8.75\n   - Now, let's subtract the change from the total tax that Austin ends up paying in the end.\n       (C = T - TX)\n       (7.22 - T) = (15.96)\n   - Hence, Austin ends up paying $7.96 in tax overall and is left with -$ 8.75.\n   - Since there is a minus sign preceding the change, it indicates that the value we started with at the beginning of the problem was $8.75, which is Austin's remaining amount.\n4) To summarize: Austin spent $64 at the electronics store.\n    - He bought 7 robots, each costing $8.75 each\n    - Tax on each robot is $7.22\n    - His change was -$8.73\nOutput:1) Since there is a minus signal prior to the $8.50, it indicates that the amount that had to have", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "1. This question can be solved by using the following approach:\n  - Convert to decimal format: minutes/kilometer = (10/6000)/ (10/6) = 10/60 = 0.16\n\n2. Using this answer as the average time per kilometer, we can use a calculator to solve for the second half time. After converting the average time, we get a per-kilometer average of 0.16 and the second half time is 1800 seconds.\n3. Then we use our calculator to solve for TJ's time per kilometer:\n    - TJ ran the first half in : 20 minutes\n    - TJ finished in : 10/6 + 1800 = 30 minutes.\n    - TJ's average time per kilometer: 0.16 + 18/60 = 1.04 km/minute.\n4. Therefore, TJ's average running speed per kilometer is 1.04 minutes/kilometer.\nSo the final answers are :\n   - His average time per kilometer is 10/6+18 = 1.036 km/minute\n   - His running speed in the 2nd half of the race is 180 seconds. \n\nInput:While traveling in an airplane a certain seat may be left vacant, thus resulting in an empty seat.

{"text": "1: Let\u2019s first calculate how many pills Holly takes in a week. We know that Holly takes 2 insulin in a day. In a week, we have 7 days, so we multiply 2 by 7. We get 14 insulin. We know that Holley takes 3 blood pressure piles in a day, so in a week we get 21. Moreover, Holley takes twice as many anticonvasants as blood pressure piles per day, and we have 2 days, so we multiply twice anticonvasants to blood pressure pills. So we get 12 anticonvasants. So, we get the number of insulin: 14; number of blood pressure pills: 21; and number of anticonvulsants: 12. So, in a week Holley takes 47 pills.\n2: From now, we will multiply the number of insulins by 4; for blood pressure pills, by 8; and for antivasants by 2. So, we get: 4 insulin x 4= 16 insulins; 8 blood pressure pills= 64 blood pressure pills; 2(12 anticonvasives)= 24 anticonvasives. So, Holley takes 88 pills during a week.\n3: The question asks us to find the total number of pills for Holley to take. And we have already know this information above.

Assuming that all the above people are still inside the elevator, let us calculate the total weight inside the elevator. In order to make it within the maximum capacity of 600 pounds, only one person can get on the elevator. For this to be possible, the people in it should be exactly 600 pounds (i.e. all 510 plus two 64, totalled it would be 600 pounds).\n3) Now, it's time to find out the weight of the new person. For one to be able to be in the elevator without overloading it, only one person is allowed in at a time. So this time, each of the 3 adults weighs 140 pounds and each of the 2 children weighs 90 pounds (total 450).

{"text": "1,1. To solve this question, you first need to calculate the number of total points that both individuals will score:\n\nNumber of points Reggie: 1 layup (1pt) + 2 free throw (2x2pt) + 1 long shot (3x1pt) = 7 and 100% of it = 6, so: 6 points(not 7 as you got from adding the values)\nNumber of points Reggio's brother: 4 long shots(0.25x3pt) = 1, so: 88% of it = 0.96, so: 0.96 points\n2. Then subtract from points scored by (Reggie + total percentage of points scored) to see how much he's losing by; his scoring is: 6 + 88%= 6.96 and this means points score = 6.96 + Reggio's brother's scoring; so: 6.96 points + 0.96 = 7.9;\n3. 7.9 less 0(1st line) is still 7.9 -> means: 7.9 points\n4. 6+185%= 7.16 and this means points lost - 6.96 = 6.16;\n5.

{"text": "To answer this question, it's important to understand what the question is asking. Here, the emphasis is on the fact that John gets a bonus that' grade is the same percentage every year, we can assume that the bonus is consistent and can be estimated the same each year.  For this case, his bonus will always equal a specific percentage of his total pay given.\n1. It is important to note that the question specifies that John makes $100, that is, to be specific, his total salary is $100, and not his total income. This is important because total income includes both salary and bonus. In this case, his total salary last year was $100, so his total income last year was $110.\n2.  Now we can look at the salary and bonus in the same context for the current year.  His total income this year will be equal to $10000 + 20000 = $30000. This means his bonus this year will be equal, in percentage, to the same percentage of his total income.\n3.  Now to get the percentage of John's total income. We need to divide his total salary ( $200000) by $1000, then multiply it by the percentage of his total income last year ( $1000) which equals $2900. This means that John's bonus will be 29% of his total income. Which will be $9000.  So the answer will be $1000.\n4. To get the number of years that it took him to make $10,0,000, we use a logical approach to solve for it using the ratio problem. The ratio would be the number of years divided by the number of pay for one year.\nSo here the ratio would be.10/10,00,00  To reduce the decimal numbers we need to add two zeros to the denominator.  The simplified ratio will be the same as the ratio we get. Which is 1 divided by 100,0,0,0  then we solve for the number by dividing.

We'll analyze them to find Tammy's catches.\n3) The first part of the question deals with finding Derek's catches:\n   - To calculate the number of Derek's catch, we get `36-4x23` (where x is Derek's catch). Since x is the actual number of catches, after substituting them into 36-4x we get `-6x`. The solution to -6x is x=6. This means that Derek catches 6 times as much as Joe.\n4) The second part of the question dealt with finding Tammy's catch:\n   - We get `((x-6)+16)+64`. We multiply this by 16 to get `96-96+96=0`. This means that Tammy catches 0 catches more than Derek does.\n5) In the end, we get `96-64+65=-5`, hence Tammy caught 5 times more than Derek and twice the number of Joe. \n6) Therefore, the final answer is: B.

{"text": "1: The key to understanding this problem is to identify the constraints that are given and use these constraints to build a simplified model of the situation.\n2: There are three types of cakes, each with a different number of votes. Based on the constraint that 7 people voted for witch cake, we know that at least 7 were cast overall.\n3: Given the constraints, we can simplify the problem by creating a Venn model. In this way we can see the number of cakes and the number of votes. \n4: We can then see that there were 21, 12, and 7 votes for each category, and 7 total votes for the witch category.\n5: Therefore, the total votes cast were 25 for the witch cakes, 19 for the unicorn, and 15 for the dragon cakes. In total, there were 69 votes. \nSo the answer is option D: 69\n\nInput:How many letters must be added to the word PIZZA so that they spell the word CRAZY?\nOutput: We can solve this by creating a chart to list all the possible letter combinations from one to 5.\n1: To find the number of letter combinations, we need to count each letter from one to five individually.\n2: So, one way to do this is to write out all of the combinations in each cell.\n3: From this, we can determine that there are 4 letter combinations for each letter.\n4: Therefore, there are 20 total letter combinations and we can now find the words that form each number.\n5: We can create a table to help us find the numbers.\n6: So, to make this table I can count each letter, assigning them one number, and then adding up the total number of letters needed.\n7: To find all of the combinations that match our rule, we can fill in the blank spaces with each of the 5 options and then count how many times each one appears in a column. \n8: For Example, when I use R to replace the letter in PIZZA, I see that it appears exactly nine times, so that should be my answer. \nSo the final answer should be option G: nine", "answer": " 60"}

'Processes 10,000 packages per-day' indicates that the two centers together average 1000 packages/day.\n2) To answer this question, some assumptions need to be made about the two centers to make an exact calculation of profit/centers. There are two obvious assumptions that can be made: the profit earned per package is the same in both centers, and the centers have the same total number of packages/day between them.\n3) From the first assumption above, the profit per-day each center makes is 5000 cents per-center.\n4) The second assumption, that both centers have the same package volume per-day, is less obvious.\nLet's do the math:\na) The sum of both centers is 20,000 cents of profit per-day.\n\nb) The sum of both packages is 30,000\n\nc) The average of the two is 0.5 cent per-package.\n\nThe second assumption seems to be correct based on the above arithmetic. The total volume of packages for the two centers combined is 30, 000 packages per/day.\n5) Now that we have clarified the question, we need to work out the profit per-week for both centers in order to get the total profit for the two centers.

So the average annual cost of a child is $10,062.50 \n4) Next, we need to calculate the total number of years, and we will use 18 as the number of years it takes until the child is 21:\n   - The total number of years is $18.00\n5) The third variable required to calculate the cost is the total cost of university or college, which is \\$250.000 in this question.\n6) The fourth variable is the total amount paid by each party, but here we only need to know the amount paid by the father or the mother, not the amount paid by each.

To finish typing the document in 60 seconds, Mike has to type just over 6 words per second or 31.4 words per minute\n- From the previous step, we know that Mike's typing speed now is 31.4 ( words/minute) or 476 words/hour\n   - We know that Mike's normal typing is 20 words/minute lesser than this.\n3. From here we can answer the question:\n- Mike's regular typing speed is 67 ( words/minute),\n   - To complete the document, Mike has to type (67 -20 )/(60) = 5.92 units (words) per minute and the total time to complete the task will be (5.92+1)/60 = 30 seconds =0.5 min.\nSo the final result is Mike has to type 67 words in 0.5 min to complete the typing task and total time needed 1 min + 0.5 min = 1 hour 5 minutes.\n\nInput: What is the answer to 2/5 of 2 / 0/5 of 3?

First, let's look at the first part of the question: \"After 15 minutes, Kris's brother doubles his speed and continues working.  What is the speed at which Kris's brother blows the balloons?\" The first part of the question is asking for the speed at which KRIS' brother blows the baloon.

When given the sentence \u2019The dog can eat the cows but the fox cant\u2019, I understood that this means that the \u2019dog can eat the cows\u2019 but also that it cant (the fox). 3. This led me to conclude that only the one cat could not be eaten by the dog, or any other animal in this context, since if it could be eaten it would not be able to be eaten.\n4. Consequently. I understood that the one cat not being eaten meant that I was looking for how many cats were eaten by all the other animals, and not the three cats all together. 5. The only other way to arrive at that answer, I think, would be to conclude that only the dog and the fox cant eat all the three cats, since no one can eat it all, even cats. In this view, the number of the total amount of 3 animals, being two cats and one dog, would make the dog go from being able to eat one to be able", "answer": " 72"}

The term: How old Rahim is right now is easily solved as it\u2019s known. At the moment, Rahim is 6.\n2. The term: How much older would Andy be than Rahim in 5 years?\nThis term is the subject of the question.\n3.  This term is calculated by a simple equation that converts age/years: (2 times Rahim) = 36\n4. This is converted to a numerical form: 72 (Rahim age at time of question)/ 5 = Andy age at time of question. 14 (Rahim age).\n5. Substituting Rahim\u2019s age with 14 in the above expression, we get: 72/5 divided by 14= 3.25.\n6. This value 0.325 is rounded and simplified, it becomes 3.25 = Andy age as 35.25.\n7. Therefore, the conclusion on  Andy age can be concluded as: It is Andy age is 35 not 33 because the 0.4 is rounded and simplified. So the final answer is  Thirty-five not 33.\n\nInput: Who is the most well educated of the four? Choices: 1. S: J 2. S: K 3. O: A 4.

Choice A: In the question, it is given that Lizzie has 1/2 the amount of crayons as Bobbye. To find out the number of crayon Lizzie has, we must identify if Bobbie doubles or Lizzie halves the crayons.\n4. Bobbie doubles the crayons, meaning Bobbie has 2x the amount of crayons as Lizzie. Also, he doubles, So Bobbie has 6x the amount of candy as Lizzie.\n5. So, Bobbie has 24x the number of crayolas than Lizzie has. Therefore, it can be said that the crayon's Lizzie have three times the number of crayola crayons as Billi. \n6. From the question, we know that Billi owns 18.

To calculate his new rate of consumption, let's multiply 8's with the current rate of 5:\n\n`8 x 5 = 40`\n7. If Alan can eat 40 wings per minute, he will beat Kevin's record in 8 minutes, as he consumes 64 hot wings in 8 x 8 = 64 minutes.\n8.

One might think that ducks would indeed fly south for the winter, but in reality, it's not that simple. Ducks do not migrate in flocks and their migratory patterns are determined by a complex set of factors that include food availability, weather conditions, and genetic predispositions to migration.\n2. The phrase \"south for the winter\" seems to imply that ducks will fly somewhere in order to survive the cold and snow of the winter season. However, ducks are cold weather species that can survive in frigid winter environments.\n3. In fact, some species of ducks, such as the northern pintail, actually winter further north than their summer breeding range, in places like the Arctic Tundra.\n4.

However, if we look at the recipe, she made one-half kilo for the chocolate chip cookies and the other half was left for the peanut butter and sugar cookies.

For example, if he borrows on average 30 books a day, then he will borrow about 42 books on Friday, so on any given Friday, he'd be borrowing 93% of his daily average.Let's use the equation k:=42 for convenience, and denote daily average as d:=(30=d) to denote the given daily average of 30 books.Therefore 93%=k=42, which is equivalent to 42/30=k1.5, and if we subtract 30/1.5, we get 0.4d\u2248k/1.5, which is equivalent to about 40 books.By applying the equation relating borrowing a week to the daily average borrowed:Borrowed books=(weekly average)/(daily average)The question asks how many books Krystian would be borrowing in a week if the open for 5 days, i.e. Monday to Friday.

Answer 48\n\n### Democratization of Information\n\n### Question:Why is access to books on a regular basis important as well?\n\n### Rationales: 1) In today's society, it has become easier and easier to access books.  With the rise of the internet and the widespread availability of eBooks, it is now possible for people to access books anywhere, anytime they desire. For example, libraries have started to make eBooks and audiobooks more available so that people can access them from anywhere, and online bookstores such as Amazon have made it easy for people to buy and download books 24/7. This level of accessibility is unprecedented and can lead to significant positive impacts on people's lives.\n\n### Why is access to books on regular basis important...?\n\n### 2) For one thing, access to books can help create well-rounded individuals who can think critically and form their own opinions. As John F. Kennedy once said, \"If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich.\" This is because access to books can provide individuals with knowledge and skill development, which can lead to better job prospects and other positive outcomes. \n\n### 3) Additionally, access to books can lead to improved health.

Then, I multiply by 6 (work time) to get my inverse function:\n\n`$t$ = $\\frac{6*0.06}{600}$`\nOr:``1/75+12.828571`\n\nBased on this inverse relationship, if I do the least amount of work of 12.83 hours per week, I will do the best.\n\n### Comments:\nThe correct solution is 12.82 hours.\n    \n\n## Instructions:\nProvide a thorough explanation behind each step in your answer.\n\n### Demo:\nI want to figure out when I should start studying for the math portion of the test. Based on the equation above, we can solve for the variable t. We know the variables x and g: x=75 minutes, g=60%.\nAfter solving for x, and replacing it in our equation we know that:\n\n`", "answer": " 175"}
{"text": "This question is asking how can Gina's account balance of $4,500 be found if one-fourth of the balance is in Betty's account and the other one-fourth is in Gina's?\n\n1. Let's consider which one of Gina's accounts is worth one-fourth of Betty's and which is worth three-fourths.\n2. We can use the formula: ([Betty's balance ] * \u00bc) + ([Gina's balance ] *\u00be) = total balance.\n3. Applying this formula to this example, we have: [Betty's Balance] = $3,454.50 and [Gina's Balance] is $4,501.25 which equal 4500. The total balance is: $7,900.00\nThat means Betty's bank account balance is $3736.50\n\nAnswer: $7900.0", "answer": " 1728"}

We will first look at what's on the car, and then we will take a look at the year of the car.\n\n### Part 1:\nIn our problem, the car has a value of $7,070 and a year of 2017.  Because the car is still relatively new, you would expect it to have a higher value.  However, there are lots of things that can go wrong with a car, so its final value may be affected by those factors.\n\n### Now let's look at the other facts:\nIn our problem:  - The year is 2017 - The car has a value of 10,000 - The current price is 7,070\nIf we think about it this way, we can see that if the car was originally about 4000 less then it would be really \"very unlikely\" that it meets the requirement.\n\n### So in conclusion: \nThe things we are looking at can change the likelihood that the car meets the requirement of meeting the value.\n\n### Answer\n\n### Input The number of miles driven by Jack is three more than the number of miles driven by Peter.

{"text": "In this scenario, Sally, Jenny, and Moses each picked the same number of pounds and the total cost of the harvest was $128, which was the total of their entrance fees, or $128.\n\n\n### Rationale: \n\nLet's first compute the entrance fee for each individual in this scenario. The entrance fee for Sally and Jenny was $16, and Moses' entrance fee was $20. The entrance fee for all of them combined was $20 + $16 + $20 = 66 (dollar signs not included). Then, each of them picked 25 pounds, which made 75 pounds total. Therefore, the total cost of the entrance fees was 66 + 66 + 99 + 192 + 160 = 715 dollars.\n\n### Rationales: \n\nLet us look at each of the options, starting with B which states that Sally and Jenny both had equal shares of the strawberry and Moses's share was 10 pounds less than theirs. This option is incorrect because it fails to consider that they all picked 25 pounds each and the total pounds were 75. Therefore, they all have an identical share.\n\nOption A states that Sally had 125 pounds, Jenny had 25 pounds, and Moses had 120 pounds. This option is also incorrect because if their total strawberry pick was 75, then it follows that Moses got 25 pounds and the others had 75 pounds.\n\n\nOption D states that Sally has 125 pounds Moses has 40 pounds and Jenny has 60 pounds. This option also fails because it implies that Sally and Moses picked 40 pounds each and Jenny had 60 pounds; however, we know they all picked 20 pounds each.\n\nFinally, Option E states that Sally and Mos have 25 pounds each, and Jenny has 70 pounds. This option works, because each of them had 25 pounds each. However, if we add the pickings that equals 75.\n\n### Conclusion: \n\nThe option that accurately matches the description is E: Moses has 2", "answer": " 7"}

We want the length to be twice the width, so width must be half the length. You can use this equation to find the width.\n\n$5 \\frac{2}{3} + 2 = 5 \\frac{3}{5}$\n\nTherefore, the width is 30/3 = 10 feet, or 10 ft.

{"text": "The answer is 6\n\n### Rationale:\nFirstly, we divide 56 into 3, which equals to 18, since 56/3=18. Then we take the sum of all the shells that belongs to each friend. That is, Jillian takes an 18 and a 9. The value of Jillian's shells (18+9) must be equal to 27. For Savannah, he is also considered sharing 18 (remaining) shells, which is equal to 3 (since 18/6=9). The value of the shells Savannah gets from the combined shells is therefore 3. For Clayton, he will get an 8 since he has the remaining number of shells, which is 5. After these calculations, the total number of shells each friend has must be divided by 3, since the shells were distributed in equal amounts. In this example, 6 is the answer since two people get 3 each.\n\n### Input\n> This is from 5th grade homework.

{"text": "The total number of gallons in the hot tub is 40. Also, the total number of bottles of champagne that can be filled in the hot tub is as follows: 1 quart is equal to 1/4 gallon in volume. Therefore, 40/1 = 40 quarts, and 40 * 4 = 160 bottles.\nThe cost of each bottle of champange is $50. Also, the discount that Jackson can get if he buys 20% more bottles is expressed by: $50 * 0.8. Therefore, his total cost with a 20% discount is $50 * 1.2 = 60.\nTherefore, the total cost to fill the hot tub with champagne is ($60 for champagne + $50 for champagne) for a grand total of $110.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. You multiply the number of gallons in a large container by the volume of a unit that is less than the volume of the large container to get the number of units. In our example, we divided 1 gallon by 4 to get 1/4 gallons.\n2. We took the cost of a regular bottle of champagne and put that into a fraction, dividing it by the discount percentage and multiplying it again. $50 * 80% = $40, then: $40 / 2 = $20 per bottle, which is how much champagne is left after you have the discount (if a gallon is 4 quarts, then $50 is 4 * $50 = 4 * 20 = 80 quarts, which gives you the math for 20% back).\n3. Then, to get your answer, you multiply the amount of liquid (40 gallons) by the amount of units (quarts).\n4. (40 * 4) / 2 = 20 (the answer) times the cost of each bottle ($50) is $110.

Don't make further assumption or add more information from the other option. \n\nWe can use a variety of strategies to solve this problem, as long as we get to the same result: \n\nThere are 3 options on how we can solve this question 1) Use subtraction to find out how many adults are with the family, 2) Use addition to find out how many total tickets are purchased, 3) Use division to find out what is the total price.\n\n**Solution 1:**\n\nIf we subtract the adult part of $12 in each column, we will get 2 tickets ($12-$12) for adults.\n\n| Child  |  Adult  |  Total  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| 1  |  5  |  6  | \n | --- | --- | ---  |\n\nThis means that there are 2 adults. \n\n**Solution:** \nLet's start with adult.

{"text": "Lance earns $262 per week and therefore $65 per workday\n\n### Input : What's the total amount of money in a savings account after the financial advisor invests $400 for the person?\n\n###Rationales: Let's examine each option and see which one gives the best answer.\n\nOption A: $2395\n\nOption B: $1095\n\nOption C: $5475\n\nOption D: $795\n\nOption E: $765\n\n#### Rational:\n\nIn option A, after the financial advisor investing $400 in the account, the amount of money in the account becomes $2400, the first digit $2 is correct, the last three are also correct, giving us with 2395, the whole number of amount.\n\nIn Option B, we need to put the whole number first and the fraction last, since the denominator in the fraction is greater than the numerator, let's make the first number is 1. In this case 1095 is the answer.\n\nIn option C, if the financial advisor invested $400, then the total amount of money should become more than $400. In this case, after investing, the whole number becomes 1497. Since the numerator is more than the denominator, so we should put the denominator last. In this case 795 is the answer of option C.\n\nOption D, the last digit is same with the question but the rest of it is wrong. The number is in the form of 7655. So the proper answer should be 795.\n\nOption E is wrong as well.

{"text": "If she gives her sister two fruits of each type, she has a remaining quantity of five pears, twenty oranges, and two oranges more than twice as many apples.\nThe number of apples (and thus the answer to the question) can thus be found using the fact 2x+2 > x+y, where x=5, y=20, and x > y.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The question asks how many fruits she has left after giving her sister two fruits each of pears, oranges, and apples.\n2. To find the quantity of remaining fruits, we need to understand how many she started with and how much she gave to her sister.\n3. Let\u2019s begin by listing the quantities of each type of fruit that she starts with.\n4. From the question, we already know that she has ten pears and twenty oranges, and the question doesn\u2019t mention whether there are more pears or oranges than the other.\n5. Therefore, we have 20or 15 pears and twenty or 15 oranges.\n6. Now, the question states that she has twice as many apples, which is 50 apples.\n7. Therefore, her starting quantity of fruits is ten pears, twenty or 15 pears, and fifty apples.\n8. Let\u2019s begin with the remaining pears; five pears remain.\n9. Five apples remain (twice as many as one pear), and fifteen oranges remain.\n10. Therefore, the total remaining fruit quantity is five pears, twenty apples, and fifteen oranges.\n11. We know that each fruit is 2nds so she has 2 of each of her pears, oranges and apples.\n12. Now that it is known that we have twice as many apples in the total quantity, the quantity of apples is easy to determine.\n13. We know that for our 2nds quantity there is one pear for every five apples, since that is the quantity in the total.\n14. Thus, two pears have 30 apples, and all of our apples together have 50 applez.\n15. For our second quantity, from our total, there are two pears left", "answer": " 44"}

Choices: \nA: yes\nB: no\nC: yes\nD: no\nRationale#1:This can't be answered just by looking at the numbers because you could combine them in different ways.\n\n### Response#1\n\n1. We need to be more explicit about the pile of 1, 3 and 6. We need to make a \"visualization\" of the answer. Visualization is a very powerful technique that requires thinking beyond what's on the page.\n\n2. First, I see that \"3\" cannot be on the pile with \"1\" and \"6\" because \"3\" is a multiple of \"6\" and \"1\" is a single digit number.\n\n3. Second, I see that \"1\" is also not on the pile with the others because \"1\" is a multiple of number \"2\" which is on the pile. Therefore, I see that I can safely put 1, 6, and 2 together on the pile.\n\n4. Third, I see that \"6\" and \"2\" are not on the pile. I don't know how to put a third number on the pile yet, so I will try to figure this out for a moment...\n\n5. Let's start by putting 5 on the pile, which is not a problem. This means that 6 must already be on the pile, because 6 + 5 = 11, and 11 is not on the pile, so we can go ahead and put 11 on the pile. Now that we have 11 on the list, we need to remove 4. We then realize that what we see is a 4/11, and this is a 4-digit number, so it may be helpful to put a place value chart here:\n\nPlace Value Chart\n    11 =  ___________01_____ ___________________ 45061\n    ________0000____ 4561\n\n6.

We don't know Angies monthly rent nor do we know her monthly expenses. We don't have enough information to determine which option is correct.\n\nIn order to determine how much Angie paid in taxes, we know that her salary is a part of what she pays in expenses. If we find out how that part works, we will know the taxes she pays.\nSo, let's say Angie's salary is 31.25 of her monthly income, which is given directly in the question. If she pays (15%)-10 of that amount, that 6.67, we can get a rough idea of what her monthly expenses look like.\n\nIn order for her to have been left with 18$ at the end of the month, it must be that she spent 48 dollars of that 80$ salary. So, she spent 62.25$ of her salary.

Jane is leaving the red car **1** hour **earlier** than expected. She should then get to the yellow car **at** sunset.\n\n### Rationales\n1. In red, the question states that if Jane is in the red car, she should get to the yellow car before sunset.\n2. In yellow, the question states that she's leaving the red car 1 hour earlier than expected, and she has to get to the yellow car at sunset.\n3. Therefore, Jane can't be in the red car because otherwise, she would've had to get to the yellow one before sun was set, but it is now, so she's at sunset.\n4. This leaves only one choice as an possible option, and that is B: the green car.\n5. Since Jane is leaving 1 hour earlier than usual, she can get to the yellow car (with more time) once sun is set, therefore, answering C.\n6. Note that no other choice has been eliminated, but B and C are the only logical choices.\n7. B is eliminated in which D is true, and A and C are eliminated in which E is true.\n8. A and C are also eliminated in which F is true.\n9. Option D remains, in which F is true, meaning that there is at most one option to choose from (in this case D.)\n10.

{"text": "The total cost of the ride to downtown is $53. To arrive at this answer, we can find the total cost of the taxi ride and the total cost of the tip first, then subtract the tip from the original price of the taxi ride.\n    \nFirst, the total cost of the trip on a taxi is $52. The total cost is found by first getting the original taxi cost, which is $22. Then, the tip is calculated when 20% of that amount is added to the original cost. The price of the taxi trip is then $22+$22*20% = $25.4, so the total cost is $25.4+$25.4*.2 = $52.\n\nNext, the total cost of getting the taxi is $3 more than an Uber (which is $22). The taxi costs $3 more than an uber because uber costs $22 and taxi costs $25.4. The same can be said of the total cost of the Lyft trip, which is $4 more than a Taxi ride. The lyft costs $4 more than the taxi, which means the taxi costs $17.6 and the lyft ride costs $22, so the total is $22 + $17.6*.2 = $53.\n\nFrom here, we can see that the total cost of getting a Taxi downtown is $25.6.\n\nHowever, if we subtracted $25.6 from $53, we would end up with $27.4. We know that this is greater than 25.6, so to find the correct answer, we must subtract the tip.

{"text": "The problem asks us to find the total value of the 6 crayon packs that Michael has, as well as the additional 2 packs he will buy. We know that each pack costs $2.5, so we can use this information to determine the value of the total crayons. Recall that when adding together sets of numbers, we multiply each number by the number of times it appears in the set. Therefore, to find the value of 6 packs of total crayons, we multiply $2.5 by 6 which gives us a total value of $15:\n\n$\\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\\\ 1\\end{pmatrix}$ x $2.5 = 15\n\nNext, we need to add $2.5 to this total to determine the value of 8 total crayons. After dividing 8 by 6, we can see that we must multiply the answer by 6 to find the desired value. By multiplying $2.5 by $6, we get a total value of $37.5:\n\n$\\frac{8}{6}$ x $2.45 = 1.69$\n$\\begin{pmatrix}{8}\\\\{1}\\end{pmatrix}$ x 1.69 = $\\begin{pmatrix} 2.5 \\\\0\\end{pmatrix}$ = $37.4995$\n\nTo find the total value of 10 total crayons, which will also be the value of all the crayons Michael will purchase at the store, we just need to multiply again the $2.5 by the value of the previous set. As such, multiplying $2.45 by 6 gives us a total value for $2.5 by (4+1+4)=$13:\n\n$\\begin {pmatrix} 10} \\\\ {0} \\end{pmatrix}$ x $\\begin{pmatrix}4 & 1\\end{bmatrix}$ = $\\begin{pmatrix}{6}\\\\ {0}\\end{pmatrix}$ = 2.5$\\begin{pmatrix}{4}&{0}\\end{pmatrix} + 2.5\\begin{pmatrix}{1} &{0}\\end{row}=$2.5$\\begin {pmatrix}{6} \\\\ {6}\\end{row}$ = $2.5(\\begin {pmatrix}{3} \\\\ {0}", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "In this question the asker wishes to know the total purchase cost for three CDs, and we are given the prices for the CDs.\n\n### Solution: For this question we can assume that our asker is buying the CDs to share and not for themselves. So,  We need know how much money he/she spent for two people. Then we can just multiply that value and then deduct 1 since there is just one asker asking this question to himself/herself.\n\n### Rationales: When two people spend $100, $50 and $85 respectively then total amount of money they can spend is $335. But the asker have only $240 (148 x 1.5+24).\n\n### This means that the asker have to reduce the amount of money in the shop by $195 ( $240 - $335). To do so, we can either deduct each value by $95 or multiply one by 1.5 and then the remain by $95. So, $195 = 1.5 x $95 which also equals to $145*1.5 = $217.5. So, $240 - 217.5 = $22.5.\n\n### Therefore, answer is $22.5\n\n### Conclusion: For this type of question, we should always solve it for two people, then it will be enough to subtract the whole group's amount of money in the store.", "answer": " 705"}

For the EPS competition, students had to take part in 2 hours long activities where they had to solve engineering based problems that came up in the real-world. In one of the activities to solve the problem, I had to build a toy car using just straws, rubber bands, and paperclips, as well as design it to travel using only the power of a spring that was given. My team and I had to present both our design and designing process to the judges in order to win this particular event. By the time our design was completed I was able to successfully travel around my classroom using various methods such as using the power of my foot, the gravity force when falling, and being pushed by my teammates. In order to create the best design for our toy car, we first began by determining the length that was most suitable for the straw, which ended up being an inch, the length of the rubber band, which was about 28 cm, and the diameter of the straw, which 0.07 inches. We began brainstorming by looking at our model's weak points. The first major problem was the unpredictable bounce of a 160 degree spring so we decided to cut another 90 degree. After our redesign, it became apparent that the car would be able to drive continuously forward which lead us to design a model that would be able to turn left and right continuously as well. Due to some errors, my team's presentation was not so smooth but still successful. I was satisfied with our final product by being able to travel down an unforced path in my school hallway! This particular experience demonstrated my skill in both designing and problem-solving. I have learned a great deal from this experience by having to be responsible for the team, while having to come up with a great solution that actually works for our school peers.

{"text": "I'll be honest and say that this question is a little confusing for me because of the vague wording surrounding how the family divided the strawberries to begin with. That said, by taking a look at each choice and asking if it makes sense, we can find the correct answer.\n\n1. Choice A: 96. I think this answer makes sense only if the family picked the berries and then divided it among themselves all at once. But that isn't how they divided the strawberies. They didn't divide them all together. They each picked some amount of strawberies separately, so at that point, there weren't 96 strawberries.\n2. Choice B: 48. I think we can dismiss this choice as well. The problem specifically states that Kimberly's brother picked 3 bags of berries each containing 15 berries. That means he picked 45 berries. So if his family picked the berries equally among them then they wouldn't be picking only 48 strawberries each overall. \n45 + 93 + 8 = 146. Each member of the family would have to get 146 strawberries, which doesn't really make sense.\n3. Choice C: 35. I think this answer also doesn't work because if they divided the berries among themselves all at once then I think 35 makes sense for each person (but then that wouldn't be a family of 3), but this wouldn't work based on how the berries were distributed in the beginning. \n4. Choice D: 32. This choice works best as I can't think of any better way to determine what their total haul was.\n5. Choice E: 32. Same as Choice D, but less organized. There are four people to divide the strawberries among so 32 makes sense, but is there a better way?\n6. It's hard to tell, but by simplifying it, I think we can see that their total stash is 4 + 3 + 8 + 9. 4 is obvious, but let's assume 3 is Kimberly's sister, 8 is her mom, and 9 isn't her dad.", "answer": " 168"}

{"text": "Input: $250 + $75 x 8 - 80% of cost = $251.60\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst, we determine the total cost to make the shoes by calculating the total price of the cobbler's work. He charges $250 for the mold, then $75 more for each hour of labor, up to 8 hours:\n$$\ncost = cost of the mold + (cost of the mold) x (# of hours) = $250 + (250x8) = 250 x (8 + 1) \n = 250(16) \\\\ \\text{ or } cost = 250 * 16 = $4000\n$$\nSince this is the total cost to make Bobby's shoes, the next step is to reduce that cost to 80% by discounting it. We discount the cost by subtracting 80% of it. The math is:\n$$\ntotal cost = cost - (2/5) x cost \\\\\\text{ or } total cost = (cost - 80% x cost)\n$$\nSubstituting in our total cost of $4000:\n$$\ntotal costs = $400 - 80% ($400 x 0.2)  \\\\\\text{ or }\\ total costs = 400 - $80 \n = 400 $(1/5) - 80\n$$\nSubtracting our 80% discount:\n$$\ntotal price = 400/5 \\\\ \\text{ or }\\ total price = 80\n$$", "answer": " 730"}

{"text": "Ittymangwark catches enough food for his family for a day, but because of Oomyapeck's appetite, he only gets 35% of his share when they split the fish. In other words, each day, Ittymangwark will receive 35% (1/3) of the original amount.  In this scenario, the original amount is 100 fish which is split between Ittymangwake and Kingnook, making it so that each of them get 50. Then, out of the 50 fish they've been given, Oomyapeek eats 22 of them, which means that each of Ittymangwarks and Kingnook's shares reduces by 22 fish. This means that each of them get only 28 fish per day.\n\n### Input:\\\nIn some countries around the world, a popular tradition on New Year's Eve is to eat a few grapes when the clock strikes midnight.  This tradition is especially popular in Spain, where in the town of Cava, people eat exactly 12 grapes one at a minute intervals.  How could you use the formula of rate times time to figure out how many more grapes they need to eat than when it is only going to take them a hour?  You'd have to find a way of knowing how many seconds there are in a minute and a hour.\n\n### R: A few grapes in Spain are eaten when the hour changes.  The number of grapes that are eaten in a hour would just be 5, where 5 represents 300 seconds.  Then you have to figure out how many seconds there are between each minute.  The seconds between each minute are a lot less since you have to keep counting after the 60 seconds.  The number of seconds between each minute is 60.\n### Response: The formula rate times time must be found from the original problem.  This can be accomplished by looking at the number of grapes eaten per minute and then multiplying the number of grapers by the seconds per minute, such that the resulting grape quantity will be the number of seconds per hour.  In other words, the grape quantity can be found by 50*60 to equal 300", "answer": " 4"}

The test is one hour long and is broken down into sections of 10 minutes. Each time the student reaches the end of a section, he scores 0.5 points. If he does not reach the end of every section within the allotted time, he scores nothing. For example, if he takes 12 minutes instead of 10, he scores nothing. Write a 4-line program that keeps track of the student's score based on these rules.\n\n### Response : Student is taking a practice driving and taking quizz. The test is one hours long and is broken down of sections of 10min. Each time the student reached the end of a section or complete 10min he scored.5points.

{"text": "The question is asking how much less rain did Greg (and his family) experience while camping versus how much rain they would have received at the same time had they been at home. To answer this, we need to determine how much rain they received at home during the week, subtract it from how much rain they received while camping, and finally calculate the result. \n\nThe first step to finding this calculation is to determine how much rain Greg received at home during the same week. The weather records indicate that Greg's family received 26 mm of rain during the same week that Greg was camping, so we can assume Greg's family received the same amount of rain. Therefore, we can simply subtract the two values to find how much less rain Greg's family received while camping. \n\nWe can do the same for Greg's family, which shows they received 26 mm at home and only 3 mm at Greg's camp site. This means they received 23 mm less rain when camping.\n\nThe two numbers we obtained from subtracting the two values are as follows: \n    1. Home: 26 - 3 = 23 mm\n    2. Camp site: 6 - 3 = three (mm) \n\nWhen Greg's family were camping, they received three (mm) less rain than they would have received had they been at home, which is a reduction of 23 mm. The correct answer is therefore \"23 mm.\"\n\nAnswer: Greg's family received three (mm) lessthan they would have received at their home, which is a decrease of 23 mm (mm is millimeters, a metric unit of measurement).\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Input : A woman has a 50/50 chance of choosing a blue marble or a green marble from a bag containing 26 blue marbles and 26 green marbles.

If Jim weighs  110 pounds and Stan and Steve  crowded with Jim on   scale at the same time,  what is the total weight?\nRationales:\n1. If Stan weighs 15 pounds, then Steve weighs 7 pounds. Because Stan weighs $15$ $pounds $,  Steve must  weigh $7$ $pounds $.\n2. Also, if Jim weighs  $110$ $pounds $, we can say that Steve weighs $7$ $pound$, Stan  $15$ $ pounds $ and  Jim $110$ pounds.\n3. Stan must weigh $x$ pounds to total weight $435$ pounds.  We will solve this $3$ $x$ $ = $ 435 $ by the method of substitution. We  write the  equation $3$ $x $ $ = 435$.\n4. We are given that  $Steve$ $weighs   7$ $pound$.\n5. Let $x$ $ be the weight of Stan.\n6. Then, $(3+3) x$ $ = 5$ $ + 435 $.\n7. Which give us the equation $3x$ $ = 442$.\n8. We multiply every term by 10 to get the equation $3$ $10$ $x$ $= 4420$.\n9.

{"text": "Merill has 15 marbles.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. Let's consider the two statements together and determine when they are equivalent:\n2. We know that Merill has twice as many, and Elliot has twice as many as Selma.\n3. Elliot has twice as much as Selma, so Selma has half as much as Elliot.\n4. Elliot has half as many as Merill, so Merill has twice as much as Elliot which means he twice as many as Selman.\n5. Now we consider Merill and Elliot together. Merill has twice as as much as Elliot, and Elliot has half as much as Selma. This means Merill and Elliot have half as much as Selman.\n6. Merill and Elliot combined have half as many marbles as Selma, which means Selma has twice as many marble as Merill and Elliot which means she has five more marbles than them.\n7. Therefore, Merill has 16 as many as Elliot, which means he needs 15 marbles to have twice as many as Elliot.\n8. Selma has 5 more marbles than Merill and Elliot, so Selma has 5 and Elliot has 5 so Merill has 10 as many as Elliot which means Merill needs 10 marbles more to have twice as many marbles.\n9. Merill has half as many marbles that Selma, therefore Merill has Selma - (H + E), so Selma - H - E - (H + E)/2 = 15, so Selma - (H+E)/2 = 10 so Merill has Selma- 10 = 20 = H + E, so Merill has H which is twice as many as Elliott because Merill is twice as many but not Elliot, so Merill is H/2 which is two.\n10. Merill has twice (H/2) + (H/2) which is twice(H=10), so Merill has 20.\n\n### Input:\"Amy and Bob have five cake slices. Amy eats her pie slice but leaves the plate with one remaining slice.

{"text": "The question asks how much money, in pennies, the five people threw into the pond after Eric, the person who could pull out a quarter, dipped his hands in the water. Let's consider the four people's contributions and how they relate to this question.\n\n## Cindy\nCindy tosses five dimes into the pond. Each dime she throws has a value of 10 cents. This means her total contribution is 50 cents. Therefore, \n\n## Eric\nEric could pull out a quarter from the pond! However, Eric does not pull out a quarter but throws in 3 quarters instead. This means he throws in 3 cents. As Eric has thrown 3 cents into the pond, so has Cindy (since she threw 5 dimes in), but since she threw in only 50 cents rather than only 70 cents, they make up the rest of Eric's contribution of 3 cents. So, Eric's contribution is: (50 cents + 50 cents + (3 cents - 10 cents) = 93 cents.) Therefore, he threw in 93 cents.\n\n## Greg\nGreg threw in 8 nickels, 2 of which are in the money. This means that he threw in 2 cents. So Greg's contribution is 91 cents.\n\nThus, of the two answers given, Cindy's and Greg's, these two make up (93 cents + 91 cents) = $1.84 cents which is correct.\n\nAnswer: \n\n### Input:(20)5/11\n\n### Demonsration:10*5=50\n\n### Answer:(50)*5/11\n### (50)*5/210\n\n### Input:-27\n### Answer:-10\n\n## Input:What is the sum of 7(9)*29? \n## Demonstration:Let's go through this math question step-by-step.\n### Step 1:This math question is asking what the sum is of 7 multiplied by 9 multiplied by 29.\n### Step2:", "answer": " 200"}

A rope is 1 foot long. We are asked if we can we can find a rope that is 50 feet in length. The answer is NO. A 50 foot ropes would take up 50/12 of the entire space and there would still be the extra 950+feet left. A rope that is 10 feet would take up 10/12 of that the space. This leaves 150+ feet left. A 20 foot rope would take 20/12 of 150+ = 11.5 feet left. A 30 foot rope would fill only 30/12 of this last space which is 9.166 or almost 92 feets left.

{"text": "1. First we must determine how far Belinda has thrown the ball. We know that she throws it at a speed of 50 ft/sec. \n2. Since she throws it for 8 seconds, we can then calculate how far away the ball is after that. To calculate the distance the ball is from Belinda for any amount of time, we must multiply the amount of time by the speed. Therefore we can calculate how far the ball is after 8 seconds. 8 x 20 = 160ft. Thus the ball is 160ft away from Belinda at the 8 second mark.\n3. Let us now calculate the distance the ball has travelled from when it was thrown to when the border collie catches up. The border collie can run at 50 ft/second, so we can subtract the distance the ball has already travelled to find out how far is left to run at that speed. 160-160 = 0ft for the first 8 seconds. 50ft/s x 8 = 400ft\n4. Thus the border collie has gone 400ft from when it is thrown to when it catches up, so it takes 0 + (400+8)/50 = 13sec. Since, per the question, the border collie travels at 50ft/second, it can be assumed that after 13 seconds have elapsed, the border collie catch up to the ball.\n\n### Input\nThe average speed for a 60 minute movie is 20 Miles Per Hour. \nA. How many miles did the movie need to drive to get 60 miles\nB. The movie travels at a different speed than the average on the highway. What would be the minimum length of time it takes to get to the average speed of 20 Miles/hr?\nRationales:\nThere are 60 Miles/hr, so, 1 Min. = 1/60 Miles/hour, so 60 Miles = 1/1 Miles x 1 Minutes. 1 Miles = 8 Miles/minute, so 60 / (8/minute) = 49/minute\nSo, 1 mile = 1 Miles x", "answer": " 32"}

Although we have the input of 6 adopted cats, we do not have the numbers of all the remaining cats.\n3. Option B:  It can' t be said that this is a choice because we can not be sure that gray cats are the only ones adopted out. For all we know, the color of the cats is irrelevant in this scenario.\n4. Option C:  It can'r be said that this is true, because this choice does not take into consideration whether the shelter population is smaller or greater.\n5. Option D: It can't be stated that this is the answer because this choice is not the smallest population.\n6. Option E:  It can'nt be stated that this is true because this choice does not apply the rules of language that all sentences must be capable of being formulated in a grammatical context.\n7. In conclusion, the only choice that cannot be stated about the remaining cat population of the shelter according this scenario, is E: It's neither the lowest", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "The children spend 45 x 20 minutes = 900 minutes x 14 days = 12,600 minutes = 216 hours in 2 weeks.\n\n### Analysis:\n\n### The children that the question is referring to here are children 6\u201310. Therefore, these children can either be younger, in which the question would only apply to 6-7 years old, or older, where the question would only apply for 8-11 years old.\n\n### The question wants the number of days each week that these children can watch television. It doesn't specify for how many hours each day they can watch. Therefore, we can make an assumption that they are going to be allowed to watch television 1 hour each day which means in total they can watch 4 hours each day.\n\n### It states that the children can watch television 4 days each week. Since there are 7 days in a week, 4 days means that in total, the children are allowed to watch 4 x 7 hours = 28 hours each week.\n\n### Therefore, the question is referring to 28 hours of total watching television on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.\n\n### There are 14 days in 2 weeks = 14 x 14 days in a month = 196 days. The children are watching a total of 28 hours a week for a total of four days of the week. Therefore, the children are being given the permission to watch two and a half hours for four days of the week = 1.5 x 28 hours in two weeks.\n\n## Questions:\n\n* How does a teacher evaluate a student who is well behaved? For example, after the students have completed a test, does the teacher call on well-behaved students to answer first?\n* After watching a new movie, how do you know if you actually enjoyed it or not?\n* After your friend has watched a movie, how would you know whether you should go see it or not?", "answer": " 6"}

How much gas will a car need for the 50 mile journey? Choices: \nA: 0 gallons B: 125 gallons C: 4 mils D:25 miles E: 1mg\n\nRationales: The question is asking for the answer to the number of gallons needed to travel 50 miles.\n\nThe most confusing choice in this question is number E: 1mgs. \nThis choice is confusing because it is saying how many mg are needed; the answer the question is how many gallons of gas the car needs, not mg. This choice is clearly an error answer.\n\nLet's examine the remaining choices.\n\nChoice B: 120 gallons. Since the car gets 25 miles per gallon and we need to travel 50 mile, this answer is correct.\n\nChoice C: 4 mil. This answer is incorrect because there is no such thing as mile; the answer should be either gallons or miles. In our case, 4 mils is clearly an error answer, so the answer to the question is not.\nTherefore, the answer to the question above is: B: 12 gallons.\n\nInput: To solve a math problem, a man writes down a, then a, and after that, a.

In option A, 50% of the total birds in the cage at the start of the test were grey birds - 40 / [(40 + 6) / 2] - meaning there were 80 grey birds in the cages.\n2. But, 50% are now birds are left in the cage, so 40 / (40 + 6 + 10) - or 40 / (56) + 10 (since it says \"half of the birds in the test are freed and fly.\").\n3. Let' s subtract 10 from both for simplicity, and you get 10.\n4. In option B, we have 80 / ((40 +6) / 2). After 50% of birds are freed, we need to add 6 and 10 to arrive at 44.\n5. But if 54, we divide both to get 0.111. This does not work, therefore it is not the right option.\n\nRationales:\n1. Rationales: 1a) In this option 48 birds were added to the 40, therefore 98. (48 / (40 +6) = 98)\n2. 2a) In this option, you are taking the two options, then using the original number; 50 / ((40+6) / 2) and then 40 birds were added to the final number you found - 92.

What is the minimum size of the group that contains none in an order?\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question asks what is the minimum number of people needed in the group to contain none in the alphabetical order.\nThe entire group has the size of four (let the number of members in the group is 4N). If there is a member, that member must have an alphabetical position between two numbers. So the possible alphabetical position of any member should be A, B, C, D or E. However, the total number of alphabetical positions in the group (the number of members excluding the member we are looking for) is 4-1 = 3. Therefore no member can belong to the alphabetical position, so any member other than the member which we are looking for can't be in the alphabetical order (these members belong to no position since 4-1 < 3). The number of candidates in the alphabetical order is 4-2 = 2, thus the question means that the alphabetical position is chosen randomly between two, the minimum group size should be 3 including 2 members in alphabetical positions.\nInput:What is the minimum average that is not a part of a set?\n\n\n### Rationales:\nThe task is asking for the minimum average.

{"text": "He made $14.20\n\n### Rationale:\n\n\nIf the total amount of rain that poured, then the rain barrel has now collected `4 inches * 15 gals/in`. This makes a total of 60 gals of rain water collected.\n\nWe then use the same method from the previous question, but this time using the total amount collected. \n\nIf the person is able to sell the water for $1.18 per gallon, then we apply the same process by dividing the dollar amount by the total number of gallons.\n\nSo we'll take, for instance, `14.20`. And `14.2` can be simplified into `14/100`. \nThe result after dividing that by the number of gallons is `0.58` gallons.\n\nMultiplying `0.58 * 100`, we get `58.0` gallons.  This is because the division is used to get only the cents.\n\nSimilarly, we can calculate the amount of water a person has in their rain collection barrel.\n`22.8` gallons of rainwater were collected.  Multiplying 22.8 `1.18/gallon`, gives `27` cents, which is equal to `$0.27`.  Therefore, James has collected `27 pins worth of rainwater`.\n\nThe number of pins worth of rain water needed to do `4` inch equals `31`.  Since `0.27/31`, equals `0.0084` and `84` cents are equal to $0.84.  So to answer this question correctly you need to sum all the pins worth of rain together.\n\n### Exportable\n\nIf you want to share this task to other people, please export it to the GitHub button below.\n\n[![Get the tutorial from GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/git-get%20it-blue.svg)](https://github.com/thanks-wesley/coding-wars-tutorials/blob/master/solution/rain/rain.md)", "answer": " 126"}

{"text": "$103.00.\n\n### Explanation: The question asks how much money Henry spent on his pills. First, we need to figure out how much he spent on the $1.50 pills:\n\n9 pills at $1.5 = $13.50\n9 pills at 9 = $81\n14 days = 98\n98 days at $1.50 = $13.35 per day\n13.35 days at 9 = $121.15\nTotal for the $1.5 pills per day = $121\n\nNext, we will figure out how much he spend on the $5.50 pills. The question asked that \"the other pills each cost 5.50 more,\" so we will first work backwards to figure out how much they cost. The total cost of these pills is $5.50 x 9 = $50.50. We also know that \"Henry took 2 pills a day,\" so we subtract 2 (the number of pills he took each day) to get the cost on each pill:\n\n98 x $50.5 = $4925\n4925 - 9 = $4916\nCost per pill = $49\n\nTherefore, he spent $121, plus an additional $49 x 9 = $441, which equals a total of $562 + $441 = $1003.00\n\n<a name=\"10\">[Prev](./10.md) | [Next](./12.md)</a>", "answer": " 41"}

NASA scientists have stated that the system boasts what is possibly the largest extrasolar planet system as of 2014. This system consists of seven planets, all believed to be rocky. Two of those seven planets are believed to have the potential to support life. In the following task, identify the correct statement.\n\n### Choice: There are two planets in the 47 Ursae Majoris system that have the potential to support Life.\n\n### Response and Explanation:The system consists of four planets that are believed to be in the \"life zone.\" Life zone is the area where the conditions to support life are the best, and the closest star to the system, the dwarf, is believed to support life already. The two planets that could potentially support life are the fifth (Gliese 581 e) and the sixth (Gliese 163c).\n\n### Choices: This system has the largest number of planets discovered (so far) in an extrasolar planet system.\n\n### Explaination:While it is true that this is a large number of planets, a planet system could hold even more. There are systems with more than seven planets. The size of the star does not affect the amount of planets that can be discovered in a system, but rather the distance between the two. The size of the planet, however, does affect how visible it is, and if it does not orbit in the right part of the solar system, the chances of discovering it are slim.\n\n### The eighth planet is in a place which it will be difficult (although still feasible) to study its composition and properties.\n\n### Explanation:The eighth world is beyond the orbit and life zone of the sixth planet.

Substitute the value for n in the equation, we got:\n\"75 = 67+68+5*12\"\n\nSubstracting 75 from both sides, we got:\n`150 = (68+5*68)+5 * 12`\n\nSubstracting both sides by 68:\n`151 = 69 + 5*73`\n\nDivide by 5 on both sides:\n0.3 = 69/73 + 5/5\n0.3 =  0.66\nTherefore:\n\n```\n75 = 69 +5*12\n```\n\nAdd the two 12, we got:\n\n```\n87 = 85\n```\n\nWhich means she earn $87 per 3 days.\n```\nThus the answer is C: $87 \n```", "answer": " 195"}

{"text": "To answer this problem, we will first find a relationship between farmer's corn, cotton and beans. For each 1 ac of corn, it will take 20 gallons. Let X represent the number of ac of corn, and Y and Z represent the number of ac for cotton and beans, respectively. So, X+Y+Z=3 acres for Bob. Then, for each 1 ac of cotton which requires 80 gal of water, each gallon of water taken to water cotton would translate to 10 gal of water for corn and 20 gal of water for beans. Therefore, X*20+Y*80*10+Z*20*2=9 ac for Bob. Next, for each 10 ac for Bob, cotton would take 1 gal of water, and beans would take 20 gal of cotton. So, 10 ac of corn takes 200gal+80*X(gals)+2*N(gals) for Bob. So, 170gal+80X=9 ac of corn for Bob. Similarly, for each 12 ac for Bob, coton take 0.75 gal of water (80*12/120), and beans will take 28 gal. So, 12 ac of corn takes 140+90*12 gal (1680 gals). Similarly, 10 ac for each Bob require 15 gal and 3 ac require N gal of water (1500 gals). So, 3 ac of corn require N gal of water. Therefore, X+Y+z+N= 16 acres. Now let's look at Bernie. Corn will take 20 gals, cotton will take 40 gal and take 20 gal for beans. Since, Bernie grows 2 ac of corn (20*2 ac=20*2=40 gal, 2 ac of cotton (16 ac x 40 gals=640 gals, 2 ac for beans (3 ac x 40 gal*2=640 gail.\n\nTherefore, we can conclude that X+Y+Z+N=16 acres means Bernie use 16", "answer": " 36"}

Choices: \nA: writing\nB: editing\nC: publishing\nD: creating\nE: completing\nRationales:\n1. The question asks when a book is about to be completed, what the person shouldn't have done. Therefore, the answer choices should be things that a person wouldn't have done when they were completing the book.\n2. Let' use examine each choice:\n3. Choice A: writing. This can't by the answer because the person would have written the book before it's finished.\n4. Choice B: editing. This can't the answer because the person wouldn't edit a book that isn't finished yet.\n5. Choice C: publishing. This can't can't be the the answer because publishing generally occurs at the end of the process of writing the book, so a person wouldn't publish before the book is complete.\n6. Choice D: creating. This can't should be one of the answer choices because it refers to a broader concept than just book writing, such as the creation of anything. A person would generally work on something, such as a book, before they created it; therefore, choice D can't be an answer.\n7. Choice E: completing. When a person completes a task, such as writing a book, they've already gone through the process of writing, editing, publishing, etc.\n8.

We can use Pythagoras theorem.  We know the length of the 2\u00d72 is 2 and the length of the 3\u00d74 is 4, so we will subtract 4 and divide by 2.\nStep 3. In this case we will find 2 as the height or length of our two-by-two.  Then we will take 2 and divide it by 2 to find the area that is left.\nStep 4. We will use the Pythagoras Theorem again, but we will need to use a 5\u00d76 since our 2\u00d72 is gone.  You can simply remember that a 2\u00d74 is a square.  So 4\u00d74 = 16.  We know 16 minus 5 will give us the side which we can then divide by 4 to find the area of the one-by-five.\nStep 5. The area of our sheet of plywood is 100,  We are trying to find how many gallons of material we can get out.\nStep 6. We will multiple 100 by 2 and convert to inches or gallons.\nStep 7.

If this is available, then the patron is using the self check-out machine, so they are not at the checking-out.  They must first get all items themselves, then use a machine, so they are at the check-out at this time.\n6.  Choice C is that the self-checkout will scan an item. This is something that will happen at checkout, not prior to check-out, therefore the patron is already at checkout when an item is scanned at checkout.\n7.  Choice D is getting help for some items in the store.  Once again, this only makes sense when the items are in the store.  If there are items in the store they need help with, then the patron is already at check-out and can get help with any of those items.\n8.  Choice E", "answer": " 188"}
{"text": "The question is asking how deep a river is by mid-July, given that the river was five feet deep in mid-May, and by mid-June it was 10 feet deeper. It was also three times deeper in mid-July than in mid-June.\nTo find out the answer, we need to calculate how many feet deeper the river is by mid-Jul. We can do so by using the logic:\n\nBy mid-June, it was 10 ft deeper than mid-May, and\nThe river is three times deeper in mid of Jul than in mid of Jun, so\nWe can state:\n\n10 feet + 3 times (10 feet) = some amount + 3 times (some amount)\n\nWe know 3 times (some number) = 3 (some number) or 3x some number = some number.\nTherefore, our equation is:\n\n10 + 3 * (some amount) = 3 * some amount\n\nWe can reorganize this equation into\n\n(some amount - 10) + 3 * some amount = 3 * some number\n\nwhich, after cancellation, becomes\n\n3 * some amount = some number\n\nRearranging terms in this equation, we get our desired answer of\n\n((3/some amount) * some amount) = some number. Since some amount = 10, by substituting knowns/variables (and rearranging/rearanging again, so cancelling again to simplify) we get\n\n(3 / 10) * some amount = some Number.\n\nSince some number is equal to 8, the answer is 81 feet deep.\n\n### Author response\n\nDuring the exercise, I noticed that the question was unclear and that one of the choices was misleading.\n\nThe exercise asked about how deep the river was by mid-July as a result of its depth in other months.\nThis is clearly not the author's intent since it goes on to say that by mid-August, the river had reached its normal depth.\nTherefore, the intended choice is C: mid-June. The correct calculation would instead be:\n\nBy mid June it was 10 times deeper so it is\n\n10 + (2 * a number) = (3 * a number", "answer": " 45"}

We don't need to worry about John's total pay and bonus getting smaller because that's not what this question asks. Our job is to figure out what percentage of John's wage will be his bonus.

{"text": "#### Answer: Sam still needs two more hours of work in order to pay for the video game console. \n\n### Rationale:\n\n#### First, we need to find the number of hours that Sam has worked since February.\n\nSince Sam was \"only able to work for 2 hours per week\" from February to March, we can plug into the equation $460 \\div (2 \\cdot 12) \\div 24$, which equals 1 hour. However, by September, Sam was able to work for 4 more hours each week, so the amount of work per day was $8$. That is how many hours per day, but Sam did not work 8 hours per day every day. He got two week days and four weekend days, so if you multiply by 5, it will be equivalent:\n\n$280 \\div (5 \\cdot 5) \\div 21$\n\nIf we divide by the original amount to check if we have enough (by simplifying using exponents or long division), it is equal to 1.5454545 (as a 5th grader I am doing this manually), which means Sam still needs two more days (approximately 8 hours each) of work to pay for the video games.\n\n\n#### The reason for the equation is as follows:\n\nThe original scenario says \"Sam saved $340 to buy a video game costing $600\". Sam has worked $460 - $340 = $120 so far, and now Sam needs to work $671 - $460 = $211 to buy the video game. However, it did not say how many weeks did it take to save $340. In other words, it did not consider the time Sam had already saved money to buy the video game (340 divided by 12 weeks); that was $28 (this is one of the reason why Sam had to work 8 hours more, because he has to save 9 more hours at the same rate).\n\nThe equation (which is actually 24 times more precise) is $460 \\cdot 23 \\cdot 24$ where $23$ is Sam's hours of work per week before the winter break, (multiplied by) $24$ is hours a", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "Demonstration:\nWe have some information so far. We know that, at least, one layer is sandstone, because the question says that half of the layers aren't sandstone. Also, at least one layer is shale, because half of the strata isn't. We also know that the strata has at least four different kinds of rock, because it says that half of the rest aren't the same kind.\n\nWe need to determine how many of the layers are only one substance.\n\nFirst, we need to organize our information in a table. We begin by writing the name of every kind of rock except the ones we know are not the same kind along the first column. So sandstone and shale are first in the list. Then we know that the other 16 are:\n\n* limestone - 5\n* quartz - 4\n* different kinds of rock - 7\n\nIt seems like the rest of this section is a test, but it's actually very important. I recommend you answer these last questions on your own to improve your learning. You can read the answer below to just get a feel for how it's done without spoiling your own thinking/learning ability. \n### Final Answer:\n\nThere are a total of 33 different kinds of rock. This means that there are 6 different kinds of rock in any single layer of the canyon's strata--one of every five layers.\n### Demontration:\nThe original question said that the strata had 25 different types of rock. From there, we need to determine how many types make up one layer of the strata.\nThere are five layers of limestone, meaning that at least five layers are limestone. In each of these five layers are a number of different rocks that make up the layer. Now we just need to count how many types make up the rest of each layer so that we can determine how many layers each type makes up since the question doesn't tell us how many layers are made up of each type of rock we need to assume that it is evenly spread out. Since we know that in each layer, there are six of them that each have a different type of rock, we can then conclude that six different types are in each layer, and are therefore one sixth of each of the layers.", "answer": " 3"}

Read the excerpt once and select the best answer to the question below.\n\nThe American legal industry has recently been faced with a crisis. For over 160 years, lawyers have defended clients and sued the state in civil as well as criminal cases. For as long as lawyers have defending criminals, they have also defended criminals against those who accused them of crimes. Until the nineteenth century, each law society represented clients as their attorneys. There were three reasons for this practice: Firstly, the American legal system had no jury trial until the late nineteenth century. Without the ability to appeal to a jury of one's peers in a criminal case, one needed an attorney to make one's argument. Secondly, prior to the establishment of the United States Court of Appeals, a lawyer had to make arguments in the Supreme Court to convince judges to overturn their ruling. At that time, the judges did not have the assistance of a jury in rendering their decision. Thirdly, without the availability of a jury trial in criminal cases, jurors needed a lawyer to explain the law of the state. There were no jurors to act on the state's behalf in these situations. Today, the system is much more sophisticated. The Court of Appeals hears appeals of state trials and a Supreme Court judge must receive a unanimous decision to overturn the lower court ruling. \n\nThese advances and innovations have changed the American system to a very different process. In fact, today both lawyers and laymen can defend themselves. This means that the role of lawyers today is completely different than during the nineteenth century. Their job is not to provide a defense to those without knowledge as it used to be. Instead today, lawyers protect people who themselves have the knowledge to explain judges what they believe the law would have them do. The job of", "answer": " 26"}

Choices: 1. A: 95 inches 2. B: 16 shoes C: 5 shoes 3. D: 105 inches 4. E: 4 shoes\nRationales: Since shoes are usually of the same height, you might assume the answer must be D or E. However, if you consider the shoe size and assume that it's the American standard of 4 - 7, one foot is 9 inches, which means that if you wear 5-inch shoes, you are walking around your office in size 7 shoes. And since height is measured in inches, 100 inches is 8 foot (excluding the base of the shoes), and you cannot wear two pairs of 7-inch shoes. Therefore, the answer is C, 5 shoes.\n\n### More advanced\n\nIn the second-level problem, the student is expected to understand the problem, choose a method, and then use that method to find the answer.

{"text": "There are 8 possible choices.\n\n### Calculate: To answer this question, first note that a single tarantula egg sac contains 1,000 tarantula legs (a tarantula leg being a spidery leg), so to find the number of baby tarantula legs in one less than 450 eggs, we need to take 450 away from 1000 and we get 550. If this number of baby tarantulas each has 8 legs, then there would be 4400 baby tarantula legs, and there are 3 baby tarantula legs for each adult tarantula.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question is phrased in such a way that the correct answer is not readily apparent.\n2. The question asks how many baby tarantulas are in one egg sac that contains less than 451 eggs.\n3. Let us calculate the number of baby taranutla legs that would be in one egg sac that has less than 452 eggs. We know that 1 egg sac, on the average, contains 8 legs. This means that in 452 eggs, one egg will contain 451 legs, and the other eggs will contain 8 or fewer legs. We can calculate the number of legs in the egg that contains 451, and it is 451. If 448 eggs contain 448 legs each, and 25 legs are left for the other egg. We get a total of 673 legs. If we divide by 8, the number of legs on a single tarantula, we get 83.8 eggs.\n4.

First, determine how to arrive at the tax so you can subtract it from the total.\n2. In this case, the tax is a flat 8% of the total bill.\n3. To calculate the tax, multiply the total by 0.08.\n4. After subtracting the total tax from the total bill, we're left with the total bill minus tax.\n5. Subtract $1.60 from the total bill ($16.50)\n6. The final answer is $14.90.", "answer": " 25"}

Choices:  a: molecule B: cell c: hydrogen d: atoms e: cluster\nRationales: Here are two definitions of a molecule: 1. A small group of atoms held together by chemical bonds is known as a molecule. These atoms are typically composed of either a single element or of multiple elements in a precise ratio. 2. A molecule is made up of two or more atoms that are chemically bonded to one another to produce new compounds. An ionic molecule forms when two elements with a non-metal share its electrons.\nInput: Which of these is an element in group VI? Choices: A: copper B: chlorine C: magnesium D: bromine E: iodine\nRationales: Groups and periods in the periodic table help chemists organize elements. The Group VI elements in the periodic table are fluorine, chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Group VI elements are called halogens, which means they have elements that can form an ion with a single positive charge (or +1 charge).\nInput: An allosteric effector is a compound that binds to and activates a protein. What does it NOT do? Choices: A) it helps stabilize the binding site so that the protein isn't inhibited B) activates the protein\nRationales: When the protein is activated by an allosteric effector, its activity level will increase. The two amino acids within the protein called allosteric effectors are responsible for binding to other proteins. In some cases, the allosteric effector may also inhibit the protein to which it is bound. Allosteric stabilizers help keep the protein in their optimal bound state. Activation of allosteric enzymes occurs when the allosteric effectors bind to the protein and increase the activity levels of specific types of enzymes in the body. Allosteric effectors can also help to stabilize or relax the binding site, which then allows the protein to inhibit activity.\n\n### CleanUp:\n* [", "answer": " 50"}

The question asks what do you call a small musician, and a fiddler is a musician playing a fiddle. So, the fiddler is a loud small musician.\n\nResponse2: A fiddler would be the correct answer.

{"text": "Their first term spanned over five years, so each year each gave 93.33 commencement addresses. The Governor of NV gave 976 commencement addresses, the Governor of WA gave 1897 commencement addresses, and the Governor of NV gave a total of 2345 commencement addresses.\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThe first term for a NV governor is five years, so we divide 4 (number of years) by 5 (to get number of years each governor was in office) to find that each governor gave 8 commencement addresses each year. In a 5 year term, then, a governor who was in office 4 years would give 3 commencements addresses each year.\n\nTo find the total number of commencements addresses each governor gave in their first term, we can add 8 and 3 to each individual answer. The Gov of NV gave 8 commencements addresses in his first term, his first year, and his second year.\nTo get a grand total of these addresses from each governor, we can add 10+20+20+9=59 to the NV Gov's total to find that the Gov of NV, in their first term, gave 13 commencements addresses.\n\nTo find out how many commencement address the other two Governors gave, we just have to multiple the years in their first term by the amount of commencements address each governor gave in their respective first term.\nIn Governor Hawkins's first term, he was governor for two years, so the number of commencements he would give that year is 4 and he gave 6 commencements addresses overall in his first term.\n\nIn Governor Sloan's first term, she was governor for one year, so the number of times she gave a commencement speech in a year is 9. Therefore, she would give 9 commencements addresses overall. Multiplying these two numbers together gives us an answer of 54.", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "Answer: Andy is 7 years older than Rahim\n\n### Explanation :\nInput: In 5 years, Andy is twice as old as Rahm is now. Rahim will be 6 years in the future, that leaves 0 years, so Andy is 2 years ahead of Rahim. However, if Andy is twice as old, it will take an additional 2 years to reach age that Andy is in now, Rahim will be 8 years. We do half and double, likewise half and double will be the solution. So, Andy has to be 8 years elder than Rahim, and is 7 years older.\n\n### Response 2:\nAnswer: Andy has to be 7 years older (8-1)\n\n### Explination :\nWe divide the 7 in half to get 2.5. Because we have been given two options 7 or 8. We then double 2.72 - 1, or 2.72+1 to make 7.5. Since 7.5 is not a whole number answer (5, 6, 7) it can't work.

{"text": "The point at which the flagpole broke was six feet above where it had been, two feet above the ground, or seven feet from the base. To calculate this, we break down the entire situation into two parts: measuring the height of the flagpole, and figuring out the distance traveled. \n-  First, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find how tall the flagpole was. The height of the flagpole is equal to the square root of the hypotenuse squared plus the square of the base. (Height of the flagpole= sqrt (h x h)) For a rectangular triangle, our height h (6 feet) and the side h= 12 feet. Thus, our answer is sqrt (12^2 + 6^2), which gives us around 14.05 feet. As we know that Pythagorean numbers cannot go into 1. (1^2 cannot go into 1) thus we do not know the exact position of the flagpole.\n-  Next, we measure the distance travel by the flagpole. Since the flagpole was 14 feet tall before it broke and then it fell 2 feet to meet the ground, we arrive at a total fall of 14 - 2 = 6 feet. (Distance = sqrt (h x 2))\n-  Thus, the flagpole would have traveled a distance of 6 feet or 24 inches.\n-  We were given the point at which the flag poll broke, which occurred two feet above the ground at 24 inches. Thus, the height of the flag pole when it broke was exactly how far from the bottom, or how far from the ground it is. In other words, it was 12 feet tall and it broke at around 6 feet from the bottom.\n> To calculate the exact height, multiply 12 feet by the square root of 12 plus 6 or 14.22 feet.\n> However, the flagstaff can rest on a table and raise the top of the staff 36 inches above the table.\n> It can be calculated based on the square root of 36 plus 36 (or square root of 72).\nAnswer: 12 feet tall\n\n### Input :An airplane weighs the same as about 300,", "answer": " 7"}

This means there are 2 times more females than males in the glee club\n3. So, there are females in total minus 1 male member. So, the answer to question 1 is x = y \u2212 1.\n\n### Input:\"You can't start a fire with gasoline.\" \n\n### Rationales: \n\n\"You can't start\" means can not start something at all. \n\nGasoline, unlike other liquid fuels, is highly flammable (ignite easily). So, the statement is true if we use gasoline as fuel.\n\n### Response:\"Start\" means start a fire. In order for gasoline to ignite something, we must put a flame to it. This will mean turning the liquid to vapour. In this case, gasoline is very different from petroleum in terms of ignition. We can't get a combustion product from gasoline. When we light up a petroleum, we get a series of incomplete hydrocarbon cycle. If we get a flamethrower with gasoline, we will just light up air.\n\n### Output:The student in the room was sleeping,\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe student were sleeping.\n\n### Outcome:\n\n\"The student in the room\" can mean students, or a single student. \n\nLet's assume the students were sleeping. It could be true because not all of the students were sleeping or sleeping.\n\nLet's also assume that the student was sleeping. So, at this moment, the question can be simplified to: was the student sleeping? \n\nIf the student was not sleeping in the room, this would mean that the teacher is now waking him up. This means if it were the student, he is sleeping. The correct answer is therefore Yes.", "answer": " 12"}

Let'st take each choice in turn and determine if it is a birthday related present.\n3. Option A: A vacation. A vacation, like a birthday, is not exactly a present. Additionally, a birthday is normally celebrated in home country or locale, which probably isn't Hawaii. Therefore, a vacation to Hawaii would not be a birthday present.\n4. Option C: Cards. Cards can be birthday presents, but they are not typical types of presents for the person and the gift can be used for other things outside of the birthday, so cards are out.\n5. Option D: Money. Money is a gift that can be used on a birthday to celebrate, but it is not typically a birthday. Moreover, again, birthdays are usually celebrated in one's home country or locale, so money would not really make sense as a birthday present. \n6. Option E: shopping spree\nIf we look at the options, we can see that they could be birthday presents. However, we need to determine if the gift is relevant to the person, so let's take a closer look.\n7. It is possible to have a birthday present that the person does not typically do or receive.\n8. Let's imagine that the person has never had a birthday present of a shopping spree given to them. Would they normally spend the money on that kind of items?

{"text": "Janice walks up 6 and down 7 flights of stairs.\n\n### Why?:\n- The first step in solving a problem is to identify each known and the unknown variables of the equation.\n- In this case:\n  - Janice walks up 5 times. The total number of flights of stairs she walks up is 5*3 = 15 flights of stairs\n  - Janice uses elevator the remainder of a day. In a day, there are 24 hours. The ratio of walking in 24 hours to time for elevator use remains the same. It is 1:7 = 1:30.\n  - Janice down the 3 times. The total number flights of stairs Janice walks down is 3*30 = 90 flights of stairs in 24 hours\n- Subtract the total number of walking up flights from total number down flights, and this sum is the flights of stairs that Janice walks during a day = 15-90 = -75.\n- This is the total number of flights up and down that Janice walks = 15+-75 = 60 flights = 6*10 flights of stair per day.\n\n### Rationales For the solution\n\n### Input\n1.The next day, Jane walks up 4 flights of stairs, down the 8 flights of stairs (using the elevator 3 times), and uses the elevator all the rest of the time.

{"text": "The question is asking how many more children there are than adults in a church.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. This problem can be solved using percentages.\n2. Remember that to find the percentage of a number (x) in a larger group (y), we use the formula (x / y) * 100 to express it as a percentage of the group. For example, if 50% of a class is white, that means 13 of the 26 members of the class are of a different race. Therefore (26 / 50) * 10 = 40%. We can express this in words as \"forty percent of the students are white.\"\n3. The adults in this church are 40% of the total number of members, so there are 40% as many adults as there are total members. We should also note that, since we want to find more children than adults, we are looking for an answer that is less than 40% since adults are more than half of the church members.\n4. To find 60% of a number (x), we simply add another 60% to x.\n5. We can express 5.5 as 60% of 9. So if there are 60% more adults than children, that means 60% is added to 5.5 = 9.6, and there are 9.6 children more than adults.\n6. 9.6 can be simplified to 9 + 6/2 = 11, so there are 11 more children than adults in the church.\n\n## Instructions\n\nThis test is to assure you understand the concepts behind the programming language you have chosen to learn. \nAfter taking this assessment, I will have a good idea if you still need to learn the following topics: \n* Variables;\n* Operators;\n* Data types;\n* Conditional statements (If, If Else, While);\n* Loops (While, For, Break & Continue);\n* Arrays;\n* Functions;\n* Recursion.\n\n## The Test\n\n<div style = \"width: 550px; margin: 40px auto\">\n<div style = font-family: Cal", "answer": " 24"}

We assume that these 2 beakers only have two copper ions in each beaker. \nThese two beakers are 31 drops (2 beakers * 31 = 62). After we have the first 2 beakers, we get another 31 drops.

The first player asks, \"do you have any...?\" If the answer is yes, the player gives that card to their opponent.  If no, they answer \"Go Fish!\".  In some states, this indicates that the player cannot make a meld.  In others, it can be a request for another card.  We will assume the former.  When an additional card is requested, the second player will have to draw from, and only from, the top of the deck.  If the top card matches a card in the player's hand, it must be exchanged for that card.  If not, it is immediately discarded and the second player's turn is passed.  Let E be the event of the second player requesting the top card, and F the event of exchanging the requested card.  Does F happen at least as often as E?\n\n# Response: E: the second player asks the first player for a card. If the first player doesn't happen to have a card, then F: exchange the card occurs. Otherwise, E: ask to exchange occurs. Based on this, the answer is yes: the second player will request at least as often as they exchange, which happens at least as often as the second player asking.\n\n### The US state of Washington has a new state song written in 2012, \"Washington, My Home\".

{"text": "For a bakery, it will need to have an effective accounting. It can help them to figure out how much money they can earn based on their cost and how many pies they can produce.\n\n#### Answer:\nTo calculate, the bakery must have a budget on how much they can make on pies. One pie costs $4 for one piece, so they need to multiply the price by how many pieces they made. That is, we have $4 * (3 pieces).\n\nAdditionally, we know that the bakery can create how many pies the bakery can produce per hour. So, this is equivalent to how many pieces, $4 * how many pies the make. We can write it as 12 pies * ($0.5 * 3 pieces) = $7,200\n\nThe bakery will make around $7000 in one hour because if the total production from 12 pies is $7000 and they can produce 12 pies in 1 hour, this is equivalent to $6,000 per hour.\n\n### Input\nYou can find a house which cost $1.5 million dollars.

We can use fractions or decimals.\n4. 1: Fractions way\n5. We can divide how much he has $48 by the how much each loaf costs $4. We can use a calculator to find out that will make 12 loaves.

He learns that the cost of the swimming lessons are $40, however there is no additional tax.  He also wants to buy a waterproof watch but it costs $50, however there is an additional sales tax on that item of 7%.  How much does the entire purchase cost?\n\n## Response:\n1. The initial cost $40 + $50 = $90, with no taxes or discounts.\n2. However, the store is having a sale for 25% off the watches. This would mean that the watch has a selling price of $37.50.\n3. When the item is sold, it applies an additional tax of 7%. This tax is in addition to the normal tax that the store takes. After the tax is applied, the tax will now be $3.75 + tax \n4. Then they receive a 25% payback on the taxes. This means the tax now becomes $2.9125 + tax \n5, Now that the additional taxes have been applied, we can calculate the total amount owed. \n6. The sum of everything owed is $37.5 + (2.464+ $1.4875)\n7. Then, the total is $37.9575.\n8. There is also a discount. Because the items are purchased, 25% off is applied.

Explain why.\n\n### Output:\nDreams are a way of storing and understanding information in the mind. They are a metaphor often used to express one's thoughts.\n\n### Rationale:\n* Dreams are often symbolic representations of one's thoughts. For example, a dream of rain may indicate feelings of sadness or frustration. Eating a food that is not edible in real life may indicate a desire to experience something new or different.\n* Dreams can be a way to process and understand difficult emotions. For example, dreams may help individuals cope with the death of a loved one or navigate a challenging situation at work.\n* Dreams are a way to explore different perspectives and alternate outcomes. For example, a person may dream of winning a war or achieving a goal. This may be a way for the brain to explore what could happen if they take a different approach or make different decisions.\n* Dreams provide a safe way to explore and reflect on one's life. For example, someone who often daydreams might use these imaginary encounters as a way to problem-solve in real life.\n* Dreams may help us connect with other parts of ourself or with higher powers, such as intuition and the subconscious.\n\nI believe that the following passage:\n\n> Dreams are a way of processing and understanding difficult emotions.\nis best supported by the following evidence:\n* Dreams can help individuals cope with difficult emotions such as grief or depression.

{"text": "Jeff spends 3 hours on the weekend every day catching up with his friends, and he spends 4 hours working from Monday to Friday every day. This means that he spends a total of 7 hours on weekends and only 28 hours on workdays and weekends. Therefore, Jeff spends 21 hours working from Monday to Sunday in a full week.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Note the use of language in the question. This sentence starts with \"if\", so it is hypothetical (\"what would happen if...\"). We can safely assume that the situation has already been occurring for the past week or longer.\n2. Since it is hypothetical, we would expect the answer to be something Jeff has been doing in the past: \"He spend X hours...\"\n3. We are also told that Jeff spends 24 hours total (3 from Monday to Friday * 8 days). If the condition \"3 hours for Facebook pals on the weekend\" is maintained, then the rest of the time - 21 hours - must be spent on work.\n4. To find out how many hours Jeff spends at work, we must find out how many hours he spends on workdays * every weekday for those many days\n\n### The correct answer is D.\n### The answer can be checked for correctness if we substitute numbers in each case and double check which result produces 21 hours.\n\n### Substitute number to find hours\nIn Jeff's case, the 7 is used for the amount of time he spends on weekends, so 7 should be substituted to find the total for the weekdays as this has a 4 multiplier.\n\nIn our case, we have the 24 because it's the total amount of time Jeff spends working.\nAnd this should be substituted into the second case.\n\nNow to find the number of hours spent doing Facebook pals.\n\nLet's say it's 1 hour per day.\nThen, after substituting into the 2nd case, we get:\n7 * 8 = 56, which is less than 21.\nThis is definitely incorrect.\nIt could be because we're missing something.\n\nLet'a think about it again.\n\nThe total spent on work, excluding", "answer": " 62"}

When he said he cut them in half, he was still referring to pizza and not the slices he would be giving to his friend. 40 divided by 2 equals 20.  40 divided by 4 equals 10. Both of these numbers can be seen below when he is referring to those 2 numbers in the answers.  If the number was 25 and he needed to divide that by 2 he would have 2 in the equation instead of giving 3 slices. \nThen the 6 slices would be left over.\n\n### How do you know this is a valid answer \n\nLard gave 1/2 the pepperoni pizza to his friend.  He then cut the 1/2 the slices into 1/2 shs.   Then they are cut in 1/2.  Then he is left with 4 1/2 sh.  Then he gives his 4 1/5 his friend.  Then that leaves him with 3 1/2. But if you think about it. He doesn't really give 3 1/5 his friends. When he cuts them in half he gives his friend a slice that is half the original pizza.  That means that pizza has to be halved again and again and again, which leaves him with a 6 piece pizza. When he says he is going to share it with his friend he is giving him 3 1/4 slices.  Which is not the right answer to the question because the question is not 3 1/3. Even if it was half that he gave his friend.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Bart bought 50 pages.\n\n### Rationales: 1: The first step is to find the cost and number of pages for a single notebook. We can determine this by finding the total cost of 10 notebooks and dividing it by the page price to get the page count. In this case, it is $1 = 50 pages. 2: Therefore, we must determine the page price to get our total cost. Since the question states that the pages count for 12.5, we can subtract 12.5 from 50 to find the price for one page to get $5.00. 3: We now know that $10 buys 50 pages, so our answer is 50. \n\n### Instructions:Complete the following sentence.\n\n### Example Response:\n\n### Instructuon:Write a response that matches the text.\n\n### Input:\"Because we have to be responsible for the lives we live.\" Choices:  A.  \"Because we are responsible for our deeds.\"  B.  \"Because our lives are ours.\"  C. \"Because each of us is solely responsible for our own life.\"  D.  \"Because no one is responsible for your life but you.\"  E.  \"My goodness, I just realized, I am responsible myself for the life I live.\"\nRationales:1. We need to find a choice that has the answer, \"because we have to be responsible\" 2. Let's analyze the question stem.  We can tell by the use of \"we\" that the answer is not singular. We can tell by the word \"solely\" that the answer isn't plural. The \"we\" indicates that our lives are not in the singular, which precludes D. 3. The sentence continues with \"we have\" which indicates the subject of the sentence \"we\" will be used. Since the subject \"we\" is plural, the sentence cannot be either B or C. 4. The sentence continues with a phrase that contains a pronoun. Based on the previous observation, this indicates the subject of the phrase, \"a life,\" also must be plural. The sentence does not contain any words that could indicate that \"a life\" refers to the single, individual person we discussed", "answer": " 480"}

{"text": "Stephanie does this by taking the larger of the two numbers: the number of candles she has, 30, and the number she wants to have to half the number she wants, 24. This means she needs to have 24 more candles. Since her original number, 30, is greater than the 9 more candles she will need in order to decorate all of her cupcakes, she can continue her original plan of decorating the cupcakes with the 2 candles each without adding any additional candles.\n\n### Input When is a word not a word? Choices: \n\n* A) When a person makes several words from it. B) When the spelling is incorrect.\n\n* C) When it has more than three syllables. D) When it has only one syllable.\n\n* E) When it has a special pronunciation.\n\nRationales: Let's consider each answer one by one.\n\nOption A:\n\nThis is true that people can make several words out of one word. For example, let's take the word 'apple' to represent the single, unique word. From this word, people can make: apple, apples, apple, and apples. This means that a word can be used to form other different words, making it not a single word.\n\nOption B:\n\nSpelling can make a word a word. For example, people often spell the word 'apple' as 'appl' or 'aple'. If you're reading this sentence where the word appeared, you most likely didn't notice the misspelling and read on without a hitch. Likewise, for people to identify a word as a word, they should know and properly spell how to write the word using the correct spelling. If not, they can't confidently call the word a word. Hence, they have to learn how to spell the word before calling it a word.\n\nOption C:\n\nSyllables help people read the word. When we read, we break down the sounds of the words at a very basic level into phonemes. For example, the word 'apple' is a two syllable word.\n\nSyllable counts can be used to determine whether to read or not a multisyllabic word. For example, the above example of 'apple' is", "answer": " 6"}

Question is 'On the last day of school, the science experiment has to be done during a four hour period. So how long is the time for group to give their results'.\n2. From the question statement, we see that the time given for group to present their results is 4 hours.\n3. This problem states that if one more group is added each extra group will give their results for 1.25 more hours. Now we will calculate 4 hours + 1.25 hours and find the time it takes to give results for all the groups.\n4. We know that, 4 + 1.2 = 5.2 and we don't want the result to be greater than 4 hours so we will have to do some simple operations such as take the square root of number like this, 5.2 = 5+ 0.2= 5.2, 0.2 = 0.2, so now we know the square root is 2, so 5.2= 5 + 2= 7.

{"text": "18 pieces of fruit\n\n### Demos:\nInput: At school, which of these wastes the most time for students? Choices: 1. C: students' smartphones.2. A: students' backpacks.3. B: hallway traffic.4. D: class periods\nRationales:\n1. The question is which of these wastes time for students.\n2. I will consider each choice.\n3. Choice A: students' back pack is a type of bag that students carry around campus. Since it is a type of bag, it cannot waste the students time on its own. If a student puts a smartphone on a backpack or takes the backpack with him when he is leaving the school, that is a different story. So students' backpack wastes the students time when it does not carry a smartphone. Since students don't usually carry school supplies in their backpacks, I would say that choice A wastes the least time among 4 choices.\n4. Choice C: students's smartphone is a type of phone and cannot waste time on its own. It can waste time if it causes someone to do something that might cost a lot of time to recover. For example, if students play a game which drains their battery so they can't play again, then they have to charge their phone and that may waste an hour or longer to recover the time. Still, I think students don't use it to do something that is time-consuming, so it should be easy to recover the time. Therefore, choice C wastes the least time.\n5. Choice D: class periods. In school, there are a lot of teaching and learning activities that happens in class. One class period is a fixed duration. If a teacher is late for class, he/she needs to spend extra time, but it's unlikely that he/she is always late for class or if so, there are other staff or teachers in charge of keeping the schedule. However, the class periods cannot be shorter or longer to fit the needs of many classes or students. They must be fixed schedule. Therefore, class periods is likely to not waste time, as the amount of time in each class is fixed.\n6. Choice B: the hallway traffic. Students at school rush to their classrooms through the hallway. Therefore, it's common that students are stuck", "answer": " 37"}

{"text": "The first step in solving this problem is identifying the relevant information. From the question, we know that the farmer spent $100 all together. \nThe amount he spent on corn seeds is $50, the amount on fertilizers and peesticides is $35, and the amount on labor is $15.\n\nSecond step is finding the total amount of corn the farmer harvested. Since we know that the farner spent $100 on cultivation, we can conclude that he also spent $100 to buy seeds. The farmer then spended $35 on fertiliers and peesticides, and spent $15 on labor, adding up to $100. He then sell the corn and sell 10 of them. The final cost of one bag of corn is $100 + 49.5 * 10 (0.5 = 10/100% of 10% profit). (49.5 = (15/3.5 * 1.10).\nWe can use this calculation and get the final answer of $54.5 per bag of corn. With this answer, the farmer will get $550 when he sells each bag of corn.\n\n### Response 1.0: The first step in solving this case is to identify the important information. From the question we know that the farmers spent $100 altogether. The amount he spent on corn are $50, the sum he spent on fertilizers and toxins are 35$, and the sum he spent on labor is $13.\n### Response 2.0: Now we need to calculate how much produce the farmer harvests. Since he spent $100 dollars on planting, he also spent $130 to buy seeds, he also spent $30 for fertilizer and toxins, and he spent $25 on labor. He then sells the whole pile of 10 bags. The amount for one bag of rice is $130 + 44.5 * 16 (0.5 =10 / 100% of the 10% profit) (44.5 = (47/42 * 1.1). With this, we've calculated", "answer": " 11"}

How many free-throws will he get if he hits 7/12 in his free throws?\n```\n```\nExplanation:  \n(1.75-times) + (3.2-times) = 4.95\n5-free throws times.25 \u2248.1384. \nAveraging.1384 x 8 games (times his season) equals 11.25\n```\n\nAnswer: To calculate John's free throws, we need to know the average of his free throw accuracy. \nAs explained previously, he makes 7 out of every 10, so if we consider all his games, he makes 70% of total throws. \nWhen we include how often he will be fouled 5- times a game, we find that he makes 11.24 free throws on average in the season.\n```\n2017/8-games\n=2017/0.8-total-game\n\u2248257\n\n257\n* 11.2-free-throws-per-game\n\u22482785\n```\n\nTherefore John makes 2785 free throws over the 8-game season.", "answer": " 112"}

{"text": "In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to analyze the numbers and make inferences on how the problem can be answered. Anna was married on August 11 when Josh was 22 years old. From this, we can surmise that Josh and Anna are married for 13 years (1992-2005). Therefore, if it is 30 years since they were married then their combined age today is (2005 + 30) years, and it is Josh's age + Anna's age = 22+?, if combined age = 22 +? (35 + 35). Then, we can divide the second set of numbers by 2, and multiply by 6, and divide by 2, giving? = 20 years. Therefore, Anna turned 20 years old when Josh was 20 years old.\n\n### Output: 21 years (21)\n\n### Input\uff1a\n\nAn example input includes:\n\n```\n2 + 8 = 10\n(4 - 3) = 1\n1 + 8 - 1 = 8\n(8 / 6) * 2 = 8\n2 - 2 = 0\n0 + 0 + 10 = 10\n47 - 47 = 0\n36 - 21 = 45\n-20 + 1 = -22\n(12 - 6) / 16 = 8\n```\n\n### Output\uff1a\n\nExample outputs include:\n\n```\n12\n(4-3)\n8\n8\n23\n-22\n8\n```\n\n(These are examples of outputs, and may not represent the entire output on the assignment.)", "answer": " 28"}

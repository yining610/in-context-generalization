{"text": "1/6\n\nA mathematician was on vacation in the tropics with his family. He was sitting under a tree by a beach, and his kids asked him for a game. \"Here's the idea\", he said, \"I'll make a number between 0 and 1 that you will find interesting. You can ask me as many questions of the type 'Is it bigger?' or 'Is it smaller?' as you wish. If the answer is ever 'Yes', I give you a dollar. Is it interesting?\" The kids were happy. They got up and ran to the beach. The mathematician decided to make it interesting by picking a number close to the middle of his range. After thinking for a moment, he said, \"8/9\"? The kids ran back. \"Is it bigger or smaller?\" \"Bigger\". \"Is it bigger or is it smaller?\". \"Smaller\". It was 7/9. After that, \"4/5\"? \"Smaller\". After ten tries, the kids had made as much money as they wanted. One last try, \"2/3?\". \"Bigger\", the kids said. The mathematician was taken aback. The kids went back to the beach with their money.\n\nThe next day, back at home, the kids asked their mom if they had done well the day they were away.

One was 5/6\".\n\nThe kiddies asked, \"And how did mom know mom had picked two at the beach?\"\n\nThe mom said, \"Because the third question was, 'Is it bigger or is 8/9 bigger?'\"\n\nAnswer: First Question: You can't be thirsty in the refinery.

With more than 2 billion barrels pumped daily through U.S. oil refineries, the oil industry accounts for 12 percent of the water used by the refining and petrochemical industries in the country. \n\nOil refineries are used to separate various components of petroleum to produce gasoline, heating oil, kerosene, diesel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), and to prepare those products for distribution. \n\nAccording to the list at the website, Oil and other petroleum extraction accounts for 196 million barrels of oil, which is consumed at the rate of 2 billion barrel of oil pumped daily, so the number of oil refineries that we need is just about 1 percent with respect to the water consumption. And the thirst is the water consumption of (65*12)/1000*0.01*1000*1000=27000.\n\n### B: water fountain.\n\nI've tried water from water fountains in university campus and the water are not usable for drinking.\n\n### C&D: plumbing is in the house.\n\nWe will ask people whether they will give us some plumbing which is not for drinking because the people we ask may not have water fountains in their houses either.\n\n##", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "B: 20 people\n\nInput: A student is struggling to study for a quiz on statistics. To better understand statistics the student decided to use a game of Twenty Questions to do so. In the game of twenty questions the computer would randomly pick an integer value(i.e. 2, 3, 5, 228, 15) from 1 \u2264 i < n, where n is the number of integers in the game. The student asked the computer a question of the form \"What is the integer?\". The computer uses binary search to find the index of the integer. For example, if it chose 228, it'll ask the student: \"Is the integer greater than 137?\"; and if the answer is no, it'll ask: \"Is the integer less than 235?\". If the answer is yes, the computer will tell the student that the integer is 228, which is the last value that has been asked. At the end of the game, the student will get 1 point for each integer the computer picked, and no points for any of the ones the computer skipped. After studying for just one time and getting 1 point, what is the probability that the game will end in 10 rounds or more?\nOutput: C: 0.198515.\n\nInput: A person has 1000 pieces of chewing gum.

If s/he wants to finish the race in one hour, what is a minimum fraction of the race the individual should run?\nOutput: A=4/5\n\n### How did you go about solving the problem? What methods did you use?\n\nSolution 1\nI used a logic based method to solve these problem. By using logic, I figured out that what I would do is to find where each answer fits since I don't know what sort of answers they are looking for. The one with the more answers and the least amount of answers is more likely the one correct. The first question, I think I know what the answer is and it doesn't seem to be a hard problem. The second one has four choices and it doesn't feel too hard since they probably wanted the fewest number, I can just eliminate all except the one choice that works and it doesn't make sense to me. The third one isn't too bad since it is an easy math question. For the fourth one, I just went through each choice and I was able to find the correct answer to it.\n\nSolution 2\nI used logic based method to solve this one. The first one, I decided that it is probably a geometric problem involving fractions since they mentioned things in shapes and I just used what I know and the numbers they specified to make sure what is a correct answer and it works for me. For the second one, I am not sure how can I solve this problem but I decided that 4/5 works for me. What I did was I used the equation from the question to find the fraction I am looking for. For the third one, I decided that probably for the answers, it would be something involving time. So based on the information I have they want to do it in an hour, so it was only natural for me to use 60 to find the number of hours but I don't know where to go from there. So I decided to go for the fastest rate the two of them could do and I got the answer. The final one, I used similar methods as the others and found the answer.\n\n### Were your solutions similar?

{"text": "64\n\n### Solution:\n\nI just copy/pasted the original solution. It's long, but I think it is a very good explanation.\nThis is how I do math:\nFor the first one, I think it may be hard to come up with an algorithm that gets the answer correctly. It seems like it will need a hecka lot of logic to get it correctly. If you have a more efficient (better) way, please add it to the discussion!\nI think you are supposed to work out in your head. I don't really see any other way.\nI think the first question asks about a process that is not limited. Like, we are trying to calculate all of the oil refineries in the world. This means that it never stops producing more oil refineries, so, in effect, infinity!\n\nThe second question is about the process of counting by 50%. If we just take our initial number and multiply it by 1.5, we are getting a really weird answer and it doesn't make any sense. I'm not sure why you'd want to do this. This question seems like it wants to find out when Bobby will have more cars than he started with. So, we need to start at the initial 16, and then determine after how many years he will have more cars than 16. This is just a simple calculation of Bobby's total number of cars in three years, and then subtract the initial value of 16, in order to get the number of cars in the 3rd year.\n\nIn the case of this question, it would be good to write out the math by hand, in order to make sure you wrote down each step correctly.\n\nI'm not a math person, but, I suppose it's good practice and a lot of the questions are doable if you know how to approach these methods.\nI would say, if you're struggling with the math questions so far, then I would stop doing the puzzles (at least for now).\nIt is just the math questions, and then the other questions. Don't waste your time on the math, if you aren't able to pass.\nIf you find it easy, then, the other questions are fun.\n\nI've found, in previous problems with riddles and puzzles, that the easy questions are designed to allow people", "answer": " 54"}

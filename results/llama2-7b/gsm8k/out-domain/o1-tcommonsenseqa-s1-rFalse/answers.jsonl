{"text": "The total distance Tim is going for the 5 week workdays is 100 miles.  There are 7 days in a week.  If he averages a 200 mile ride for each weekend, then we have to subtract the 7 days worth of work from the total of the 5 days, and then add the weekend days total, and divide that by the amount of day trips to work, and then times by 4 to account for bike speed.    Since each weekday is 34 miles, then the total weekly miles are 100 miles - 34 miles for each weekday (5) + 200 miles for the weekend = 456 miles.  The number of days are 7, and then subtract 5 from 7, and that leaves two.  The total miles for the week are 456 miles, then we must divide that by the total number of days, which is 9, then multiplied by the speed of biking, or if we divided the miles by 5 the total bike riding time would be 456 miles divided by (5 x 5) or 100 minutes.\n\n100 minutes divided by 60 minutes in an hour times a 6 hour day means he needs 3.6 hours to bike the 100 miles for 5 days for work.  Subtracting the weekend rides of 200, means we subtract the 100 for a total of 600 miles (456 miles for 5 days of work plus the 600 miles for two weekend rides).  We divide that total by 7, which makes it 92.86 miles he needs to bike on the weekend days.  He must ride the 92.8 miles on the weekend divided by (60 biking minutes, times 6 biking hours)  to be 10, and 3/4 hours.\n\nThe total time biking per day for 5 days of the week total for the 5 days of work to be 10 hours and 20 minutes.\n\nThe total number of minutes from leaving home, to work, and returning home is 480 minutes, which is 10 minutes times 10 miles", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "Three additional buildings collapsed after each earthquake. There were a total of four buildings. After each earthquake, the probability of the next one collapsing would be 1/3 and not 1/square root of 2. A probability of 1/3 implies no additional buildings collapsed. This question does not make sense.\n\n### Reason: The given number of buildings collapsing does not change after each earthquake and is the same after each earthquake whether it collapses or does not collapse. Therefore, the probability of it collapsing after each earthquake is always the same.\n\n### Detailed Justification:\nWhen an earthquake occurs, there is a possibility that any of the buildings in the area of the earthquake could collapse unless the buildings are well built. \n\nWhen an earthquaking collapse occurs a random building or buildings randomly within the scope. \n\nThus, the probability of any building in the scope of the earthquake collapsing is 1/number of buildings in the scope. \nIf the number of buildings that collapse does not change across each earthquake then the number of buildings collapses for a probability of 1/4 is 1/4, the same as the probability of 1/2 collapsing. Thus, there is no difference in any earthquakes since there is no probability change in the number of collapses given an earthquake. Thus, a total of 1 building collapsed after the first earthquake and 2 in each additional earthquake.\n\nIf the number of collapsable buildings in scope increases, then the probability of each successive building collapsing in an earthquake increases by 1/sqrt(2). If the buildings keep collapsing at this probability, then each successive earthquake would add the same number of buildings that the previous earthquake collapsed. This is what the question asks initially, to the first earthquake (building collapse). The numbers do not add up to match this pattern because, if the buildings keep collapsng at the previous rate, then the fourth earthquake should not happen as that would be adding all previous buildings collapsing. This does not account for the fact that the collapse rate of the buildings increases with each additional earthquake, thus accounting for the additional number of buildings each time.\n\n##", "answer": " 60"}

I will explain case by case.\n\n#### Case 1:\n\nGroot was at his home before going back to the sun. \n\nEnergy used by the ac = (1/120) x (1.5 x $2.6 x 1/1) = $7.5 135\n\n#### Case 2:\nGroot went back to his house before using the ac. \n\nE= (1/365) x (1.4 x $2.6 /1) = $2.28 135\nGroot consumed $3.85.\n\n### Other answers:\n\nI have come to a conclusion that there are other answers also to the question.", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "60\n\n### Instructions: The solution for this problem is a two step process that includes an algebraic and an arithmetic solution.  Write a sentence that summarizes your steps and answers the original question.\n\n## Solution:\nSolution:The solution for this problem is to first take the $3 and divide it by $0.2 and you're going to get $15. Then multiply 15 by the cost to make a single bag of granola, which in this case was $3 and then you can subtract that amount from $18 which you are left at $1 and that is the amount of money.\n\n## Conclusion: \nThe conclusion that I came to is that in the first step, we divided the $3.00 by the cost per bag and we got $15, second step I multiplied $15 by 3 and then finally, I subtracted 3 from $18 to find the net profit which ended up being $1.", "answer": " 50"}

I know that they are both going to be negative. That means that they share a negative sign. So in order to take away -4 from -5 you are going to want to make the two signs neutral. I know that 1+2=3, which means that for every negative number I am going to add -1. I know that for every negative number that I am adding 1 in order to get the two numbers neutral and neutralizing the negative sign. So I will add -1 to the -4 to have -2 and -1 to the -5 to make it -4.

She uses the following ratios to calculate the amount of paint she needs to cover her house (400 sq ft + 600 sq ft for living room, 400 sq ft for each of the 3 bedrooms).\n\nI need to come up with a ratio for each door. I will try a few different ones. One solution is to determine the 1 door is about 400 sq feet and the other 3 door at about 600 sq feet. This makes 400 + 1200 sq feet.\n\nI guess I need at least 2 gallons of paint, but can't use this as my answer until I cover all 4 doors. \n\n### Input\nHenrietta is repainting he house. The walls in her living room take up 1200 square feet, She has four bedrooms. The walls  in each bedroom take an average of 300 square feet. How much paint is required to paint her house? \n\n### Response\n\nTo answer this question it is important to figure out what the average is of all 4 door total. I do this as follows: \n \nAverage = 1200/4  = 250 sq feet\n\nEach door is approximately 250 sq ft. So to cover all doors, my answer is 250 + 250 +250 + 400 +1200 +400 +1600  = 4250 sq feet. Therefore I need 2 gallons of white paint to cover all the door.\n\n### Inputs:\nHenrietta needs to figure out how many gallons of white paint are needed to cover all the doors of her house.\n\n### Response \nOne door = 1 part in the whole. It should be about 1 part in the 1200 total square feet. Each door is 400 sq/ft. Therefore multiply 1200 by 2 1200 x 2 = 2400 \nI need at least 24 gallons of white paint.\n\n### Explanation:\nThis question can lead into a more advanced task such as converting square feet", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "The problem is to figure out the amount of earnings he makes over 35 hours of work.\nWe can use multipliers by 24 to find the answer to this problem.\nTo explain the problem, we need to understand what variables exist and what units they are in. The problem states that it is a 35 hour week so that units are each 1. Lance's hourly rate is 9 dollars and hour; I'm going to multiply the hour rate to find the total earnings for that week. To find these rates multiply by 24. To break it down the equation would be: 35 times 9 equals 315 dollars. Now we can use a formula to write an equation to figure out the pay for each day: pay for day=worked hours of day * pay rate\n\n### Explanation:\nThe first thing that you must do is identify variables. As we can see, the units are in a one week span. There are three variables: \"hours\", \"$\", and \"dollar\". The problem gives us hours, but we need to turn this to something that a calculator can understand. The hour would be represented by a \"24\". To keep it simple, I will explain it this way. I can think in hours, for example, \"I worked twelve hours today.\" To represent to this on a calculator you put a \"24\" in a calculator. So, for example, three \"24\" equals three hours. When you know that, multiply it with the pay. To break it down this formula you use the following equation:\n\nIf I get paid $9. And I work for 35 hours, I will get paid $ 330. (35 is multiplied by 24)\n\nNow, to work out this problem correctly, write an equation and find the answer.\nMultiply the amount of worked hours by the pay they earn.\n\n\n### Justify your reasoning and show all work.", "answer": " 63"}

The book #1 books you collect from your students will be transferred to another shelf of the library. The next time you go to the library you will have removed 2000 book #1 because you got the new books from the high school.

How much money must be put in the bank so the Grange can continue on?\n### Response: At the end of the week, the Grange has $45 of expenses that it need to pay off. 45 + 45 = 90. So, there would be $5 left in the bank after each week. If $5 was taken out of the bank each week, the bank would be $110. And this is all the bank has. The bank is depleted and cannot receive more funds. At the end of the month, the Grange needs to put in $70 extra dollars to the bank so that the current amount can be used.

{"text": "2400\n\n### Instructor Comments:\nThe above is written in code and the \"output\" of the task is correct. This is an example task of what we called \"response\" and is an example of an example of response question.\n\n## Task Specification\n\nTasks are a way to describe what a student should do to successfully answer a problem and how to submit answers or solutions. Below you will find a brief overview of responses, questions, rubrics, tasks, and instructions. To learn how to describe what your students should do for each task, refer to [Using response tasks](/curriculum/using-response-tasks/). For an example of a simple task, and how to make a basic graded task, refer to [Write rubrics and tasks](creating-resources/tasks-and-rubrics/).\n\n### Input\n\nThe task inputs are those things your student must understand in order to answer the question. For basic response questions, a single input is sufficient.\n\nInput: How many candles are present during a birthday party? Choices:      A: candles B: 120\nAnswer: B: 12\n\n### Demostration\n\nThe demonstration shows and/or validates what a correct answer looks like.\n\n### Answers\n\nIn response tasks, a submitted answer receives points according to how well it matches an expected answer. The expected answer is the way you want to assign points and is typically set up as a rubric. If your question type is \"basic response,\" then a rubric is not necessary; a correct or incorrect answer is sufficient.\n\nAnswer:  3\n\n### Note on answers\n\nThere are two different aspects of the answer that may require a rubric:\n\n1. Submission\n2. Points\n\n### Submission\n\nThe **submission** is the item your student submits to you. In response tasks, the submission could be entered into a text box, filed in another format, written on a separate sheet of paper, or any other means that is appropriate to the task. You can also use [form-handling](/curriculum/handling-forms/) to process submissions and assign points. \n\n### Points\n\nThe **points** is how you want to assign scores.

{"text": "5400 vibrations\n\n### Input\nA water filter is a device designed specifically to filter and remove certain impurities, such as microorganisms, suspended solids, and materials dissolved in water. The goal of a water filter is to remove these unwanted elements from the water to improve its quality and make it safe for drinking or other purposes.\nA water filter consists of a porous substance (called a filter medium) that is capable of trapping sediments and other unwanted contaminants. The filter medium is typically made of materials such as carbon, sand, or ceramic. The water flowing through the filter is passed through a series of filter chambers, each containing a different type of filter medium to address specific impurities.\n\nSome commonly used types of water filters include:\n-Carbon Water filters: Carbon filters are made from granular activated carbon (GAC) and are widely used for their ability to remove organic compounds, chlorine, and other chemicals. They work by absorbing these contaminants into the carbon\u2019s large surface area.\n-Reverse Osmosis (RO) Filters: Reverse osmosis filters use a semi-permeable membrane that prevents contaminants larger than water molecules from passing through. They are often used to remove various impurities including salts, bacteria, viruses, and other biological contaminants.\n-UV Filters: Ultraviolet (UV) filters use ultraviolet light to kill microorganisms and other impurities within water. They are often used as a complement to other filtration methods, such as GAC or RO filters.\n-Water Distillers: Water distillers heat water to produce steam, which is then condensed back into water. This removes all contaminants, such as microorganism, chemicals, and heavy metals.\n\n### Response\nA water filter is essential for the maintenance of water quality and is widely used to remove various impurity. Some commonly utilized types of water filters consist of Carbon water filters, Reverse Osmosis ( RO) filters, Ultraviolet ( UV) filters, and water distillers for decontamination and protection. Furthermore, water filters are commonly used to meet the drinking or sanitation water standards", "answer": " 768000"}

Where could you find some dirt that would not be of any use to you if you were trying to make a cake?\n```md\nDirt is a great cooking material. If you were to make a cake, and you wanted to make sure the quality didn't fade with time, you would have to find another ingredient because dirt goes bad quick.\n```\n-I like how you answered the question by using a simile in the beginning and a play on words with the name of the ingredient in the end. The answer can be easily understood through imagery alone.\n2. If a car could cost $13,000 what could also cost that same amount as that of a car?\n```md\nThis is a little hard to imagine because you don't know the size of these two items. Because all the numbers are the same, my guesses would be either an egg or an object with a similar value as an egg.\n```\n-Easy to understand and logical answer.\n3. If you have a pencil, a ruler, and paper. Which of these would be the most useful? The answer is d: paper.\n```md\nPaper would definitely be the most useful just because you can use it again and again. You can take down notes, do calculations, and draw things. These activities can all be done more efficiently than with other means on paper.\n```\n-You really thought through your answer and I really like your play on the first part of the sentence \"If you have\" since many people would have just said the ruler (the obvious and more logical answer). This kinda makes me feel like there is a test, so I will have to \"study harder\" next time.\n\n# Comments\n* 1.

How much will the discount be worth?\n\n### Demostration:1- You want to give a discount of 75%, then the selling price must be 0.75 (75%) of the original cost. 2- to give a discount you need to use the 100% of the original cost.Then the discount will be 25% or (1-0.75)= 0.25,then,\nthe 75% discout rate is given by 0.75 / 0.25 = 3.0 times higher than the 25% discount rate. 3- 3 is the % increase in the discount rate.\n4- therefore, to get the 75% discoub rate, you multiply the cost by 75 / 3, then, the result is 217.5%, and you need to multiply the cost by 1.2175 to get the new cost..5- then, to convert the cost in $ to dollars, you should multiply the result by 600, then you'll get the new cost.\n\n### Delivery:\nI used 1.218525 to find the new cost because I rounded it a bit to make it look more accurate since I already know it should 1.2197. so I just subtract the 0.0017\n\n### Input:-40 +32\n\n### Demos:\n1- add 32 -40 to find the value of the number, you should get 12\n\n2- add 40 +32 to find the value of\nthe number, you should get -18\n\n### Destion:\nThe answer is 40", "answer": " 72"}

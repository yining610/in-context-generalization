In the bank she wants to get at least 50 dollars. She will use the following strategy to find out the amount of nickels she should give the teller:\n1) the number of nickels she is going to bring to the bank will be rounded to the nearest integer and divided by the number of dollars she will get from this amount,\n2) if the remainder is greater than 10, she will have to add the amount of 5 cents to the original number of nickels so that 10 is added to the remainder. If the remainder is less than -10 (-9 for example), she will instead subtract from 10 the remainder to make it a positive number. Alice starts with 20 nickels and rounding the result to the next integer, she is going to get the amount 20 divided by 50 = 0.4. After she does the operation, the remainder is -10 and she will have to subtract -5 instead of add 5 to the original amount of nickels in order to make the remainder 5.\n\n1.

{"text": "It will take 4. This is because, to find the exact number of hours needed to fully pit all the cherries, multiply 3 * 80 / 20 which is equal to 3000 divided by 20 which equals to 150. As you know that, it takes 10 minutes per pot of cherries, it should take 150 * 10 minutes to pout the 3 pounds of cherries. That equals to (150 *10)*3. Finally divide 3 by 150 and you will get your answer with a remainder of zero. The remainder is zero because there are no whole numbers after 150 that add up to 4. This is the reason that I believe you are looking for the answer in the form of a whole number.\n\nInput: What type of food will a cat only eat if it is very hungry?

{"text": "The correct answer is $6.00.\n### Instruction:Answer the below and also add your own question and answer it.\n\n1. What\u2019s the square root of 261?\n\nExplanation - A square root is actually a side length of a square. \na. You have to square both sides and subtract twice the number, then divide it by the same number that is above your sqare root. \nb. A square with a side length equals 261 will have a total area equal to 261. So you have to find the side length, for that you have to square both sides:\n\nThe side of the square = x2 \nx2 - 261x = 261 x \nx(x - 261) = 261 \nx - 26x =-261 \n\nAfter squaring both sides:\nx2 -(x2 - 132x) = -261x \nx2 +132x - 265x = -261 x  -265x/-261x = x/(1/2) ==> x^2 - 133x / x(x)-133x \nBut since it's a square:\nx^2 - 128x =1 \nx^2 - (x - 1)x -2x + 1 =1 \nx(x-2) -2x =1 x(x -2) -2 = 1 \nx =1 \nSo, from the original equation what is the side of the square? \nx= root x -> 133 \nSo, to round this to the closest number and the number we want is exactly 261. \nWhat\u2019s the square root to 261? \nAnswer:\n \u221a261 = 133\n \n2.

The number of square blocks constructed = 63.  For the question regarding 2, 3, 9.  Since the value of all the variables are known, we will be using PEMDAS in the question's second statement.  Answer (2*3)+6= 28.   9*28= 252.  Then, the number of square blocks constructed= 252\n\nInput: How many more times is the number 23 more than the product of two consecutive whole numbers? Choices:  When I see the question, I think to use something I've learned earlier like Factoring.  For this question, I need to use prime number factorization.  I know how to do it well, so I'm going to use it on the question.  When the prime factorization is divided by the given number, it would come out equal two times that number plus one.  If the dividend is 23, the value obtained by dividing the dividend by each factor would be 23/1=23,23/2=23/3=9.  It would take three times that number.  If we add those numbers that are factors, we get five.  23*2 is 46. 5+ 5 gives 10.  The number of times 23 is more than twice the product of two consecutive numbers is 23*2.\n\n# Question 75", "answer": " 350"}

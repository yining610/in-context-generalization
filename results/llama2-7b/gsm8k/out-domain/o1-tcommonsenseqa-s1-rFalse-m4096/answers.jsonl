When the magic pencil is used, the pencil will draw the required length of line or circle for a given equation or circle inside a circle.  However, if the pencil is used to do the same activity more than once, the resulting lines or circles will be the same size as the last one. For example, if you used the pencil to draw a circle of radius 2 units and the thickness of a letter t, then draw a line of length 2 units inside that circle, the resulting circle of radius 2 plus the line is twice that big or 4 units in radius. If you repeat this procedure, the circle will be twice as big again, or 4 plus 2,  (4+4+4+4) units in radius. If the radius of the circle keeps building up like that, an infinite number of times, its radius would approach infinity or the diameter of the earth. What is the radius of the earth?  (If your pencil runs out of length to draw, leave the radius of the most recently drawn circle.)\nOutput: The radius of the earth is 7915.2 meters\n\nInput: When you are building with Legos, the ratio of the number of 3x3 blocks to the number of 1x1 blocks is about 1:9.

How many blocks of size 2^(n-1) are required to make a pyramid whose height is 3*2^(n)?\nOutput: The size of a block of 2^(n-2) is required to make a pyamid whose height is about 12 (3*2^(n)) with 2 blocks required for each of top 4 layers.\n\nInput: Two people are making a paper helix.

However, I found out later (with the help of my computer science tutor) that because the recursion stack is bounded, it will always use a depth of 10 which makes the recursion stack too small to support the size of the tree in this case. \nI have read about the difference between the recursive tree search algorithm and the non-recursive tree search algorithm.  In other words, in the recursive tree search algorithm, the recursion depth is always limited by a maximum recursion depth.  Thus, the tree is only limited and searchable depth-first, bread-first or in any order, not top-down.\nI chose to do it top-down because it's the simplest method out of all. I then did a binary search to see where the leaf node is. So, the recursion is not bounded. \n\n\n### Output Jenny ate 19 chocolate squares. (Correct answer) \n\n* There are two ways to think about this question. One, Jenny ate 6 more than thrice than what Mike ate. In other words, five times 6 = 30. So, the number that Jenny ate is 30+19= 49.\n* Or Jenny ate 49 chocolate squares because 3 times 9 is 27 and thrice 3 is 9.\nHopefully, the explanation above helps make sense to how this question was solved.\n\n### Note:\n* This question cannot be solved recursively, however, the recursive function", "answer": " 65"}

{"idx": 67, "text": "1140\n\nInput: A tire repair shop that has limited space has to determine some rules to store some tires. In that case, each tire is to be stored vertically and in a way that only some specific number of spokes can touch other spokes, and it is an absolute requirement that the number of free spokes must always be bigger than the number of tires in the warehouse. They found a number k so that for all k, there are more free spokes than tires in the wagehouse, which means that for all k bigger than k' bigger than 0, k - k' >= 0 and the system never gets in an inconsistency problem. Also, the tires are stored such that the largest dimension is at the center, and if the largest dimension is bigger than the length of the warehouse, the second largest is bigger, and so on, until the tires are in an order from smallest to biggest dimensions.

This door needs to be moved 7 feet.  The door weighs 200 lbs. In the old days, people used this method to move the door.  They would place something called a \u201ctripod\u201d underneath the 200 lb door and it would act as a fulcrum.

This function should take 2 parameters, head and flip(), then return the result of the outcome. So it can be called with or without parameter head. The function should return either \"heads\" or \"tails\" depending on the input. You can make heads true and tails false, since JavaScript is strict typing and you couldn't have a boolean that's both true and false at the same time.\n\n2) Use the function to randomly pick one of 2 coins, then return \"one coin, or both\" as the type of coin. Call the function with two parameters, 1 to 2. If 1 is a positive integer less than 2, return a \"one\", else return a \"both\".\n\n3) Write a function to determine if it is a vowel: a, e, i, o and u. The function will have to take a string and return its result.\n4) Write a function called reverse() that takes one parameter, a string and returns the input string reversed.\n\n5) Write a function called concat() that takes an optional number of parameters, and concats its inputs together into a single string. The function should not use the global \"concatenate\" function that is already available to you in JavaScript.\n\n###Instruction:Solve the puzzle with the instruction below.\n\n<img src=\"https://imgur.com/wOZ9qDt.png\" alt=\"image\" style=\"zoom: 10\" />\n\n<img src =\"https://imgur.com/_JWCuWO.png\" alt=\"28.png\" style=\"zoom:-10\" />", "answer": " 11"}

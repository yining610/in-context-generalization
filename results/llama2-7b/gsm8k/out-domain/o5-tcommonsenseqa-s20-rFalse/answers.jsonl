Each of the categories had only one correct answer. In order to find out the correct answer to the first question, you must use logic to find the category that contains at least two of each object. For example, if the question said that A or B is correct, you can eliminate A because B contains at least two of every object within that category (household products).

I ran this code on the test data provided, but the code returned 100% accuracy, which made me suspicious.\n\nNext, I did the same task but with lower and upper case versions of the input. This yielded accurate results in the majority of test cases except for test cases B, E and H:\n\n  (Test 0)   Test Answer \tTrue False\n    1          A             A\n    2          B             A\n    3          C             A\n    4          D             A\n    5          E             F\n    6          F             A\n    7          G             A\n    8          H             T\n```\n\nFinally, I ran the two programs which produced the two separate results of True and False. I suspected that the \"A\" in test case E and H was in some way related to the \"F\" in test case 5 and 8. I then tried the same algorithm applied to a slightly different pattern to prove this hypothesis. The program I built returned, the same truth value in all test cases with the exception of test case", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": "Jenny, 15 inches and Jake 55 inches\n\n# Challenge\n\n## Question One: Average Speed Challenge\n\nThe challenge in the first question you received is to write a program where you're going to input the speed each car travels, and then it would figure out how fast the average speed is going. So you need to find out what the average is, with a little bit for fractions. We want the program to be more robust so we can handle if anybody writes in anything that is less than 0, anything that is greater than 65, and to find out what the denominator is and the top part as a result. I'll show you what that looks like:\n\nA = 20, B = 50, C = 80, and D = 65\n\nHere, I've got a loop for each individual car, and I'm doing the average between each of those. That way, we get the value of the average, which is exactly 175.25.\n\nYou should create the function calculateAverage in this way that does the same thing.\n\n## Question Two: Longest Sentence\n\nNext, the question we're going to do is find out the longest sentence in a paragraph of sentences. The thing with this is that there could be hundreds of sentences in one paragraph, but we want to find the longest sentence out of all of them. There's a function called `String.join`, which makes it where we can get all together just one long sentence. But each sentence is going to have a different length, so it's a bit more difficult to actually get the largest sentence length out of that.\n\nHere's what the data that you've received looks like:\n\nWe want to find the largest sentence length out here, and so we're looking at the longest sentence here which is 115 characters, which is the largest out of the others.\n\nLet me demonstrate in the function how we do that, and then you go from there to make that function do it as a homework assignment. \n\n# Hints\n\n```\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class LongestSentence {\n\n  // I need to read all the words in a list into memory so we can access it\n  // to join together the sentences.\n  public", "answer": " 41"}

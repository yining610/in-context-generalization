{"text": "There are 300 flowers in the garden.\n\n### Rationales\n\n1. If the three types of flowers in a garden add up to 100 flowers, you can infer that there were 100 times 3 (yellow flowers X purple flowers X green flowers) flowers altogether 1.\n2. There were 10 yellow flowers for every two purple flowers. 2. This suggests that yellow is 2 times more prevalent than purple, meaning there are 200 yellow flowers in the garden. \n3. Purple is 2 times more common than green, meaning there are 125 purple flowers in the garden. Put yellow flowers = 200, purple flowers = 125, and green flowers = 100 3.\n4. There are only 15 green flowers in the garden (a result of multiplying 100 by 1.66, given 100/80 = 1.25).\n5. Multiplying the numbers from each step in turn gives 80 + 10 + 80 + 80 = 80 4, suggesting that there are 80 flowers of all three varieties in the garden.\n6. Finally, we can multiply the three numbers - 80 for all flowers, 80 purple and 80 green and 200 yellow - to arrive at 80 x 80 x 200 = 32,000 flowers in the whole garden.\n7. Given that there are 300 flower in the garden, we must divide so that 300/32 is 9.4, then subtract 9.4 from 100 and obtain 90.6.\n8. Therefore, there are 30 total flowers in the garden, 6 in yellow, 49 in purple, and 45 in green.\n9. So Mark has 300 flowers overall.\nAnswer: B. 300.

Choices:  Wear warm cloths, Wear hats Wear mittens Use a hooded sweatshirt\nRationales: Option A: Warm Clothes includes many items that people wear on cool days to stay warm. Hooded sweatshirts are commonly worn because they are warm and have the added feature of being hooded. Mittens are something like gloves, but their individual fingers have a separate cover to protect the fingers from the cold; they are a popular option on very cold days. Hats are popular clothing for protection against cold weather. Hats also have the benefit of a covering the ears and a lot of the head of the person who is wearing them. These may be worn in conjunction with other warm clothing or on their own, depending on the conditions.\nOption B:  Mittens are similar to gloves and can be used instead of gloves in cold weather. They are typically made with similar materials (i.e. wool), but each finger has its own cover and not the whole hand, which helps to be keep the individual fingers warm. Mittens also have the benefit of hanging easily and taking up less space in your pocket or your pants pocket (making them easier to grab if frozen hands are causing a problem).  Hooded jackets are ideal for both protection from cold weather and a cool look. A hood serves to protect the face and the ears and the jacket may be worn with or without another layer of clothing. They are generally useful for covering the neck and chest and are therefore ideal for keeping one warm on very cold days when wearing gloves would cause one to lose fingers. A hooded jacket can also be worn by people who do not want to wear heavy boots on a cold day; this would allow one's feet to be able to breathe and be at a lower temperature, as would be the rest of one's body.\nOption C: Mittens are small pieces of clothing that are made out of wool and that protect the hands from cold weather.

So firstly, we will consider each option and see if they match with the given questions. \n\nSo, the given options are: option (a), option (b), option (c) and option (d). \n\nThe question is asking for the age of Jolyn. Thus, we will consider option (a) first. \nFirstly, we will check out if Jolyn is 5 months older or younger than Therese. We see that the option is saying Jolyn is 3 months older than Therese. Thus, option (a) doesn't match with the given question. \n\nNext, we will consider option b. It says that Jolyn is two months younger than Aivo and Aivo is two months older than Leon. From the question, we see that Leon is two months older than Aivo, thus Leon is two-months older than Aivo. Thus, Jolyn is 4 months older than Leon. So, option (b) does not match with the given question either. \n\nAfter that, we will consider option c. The option states that Jolyn is only 2 months older than Leon. To answer the given question, we see that Therese is only 3 months older than Aivo while Jolyn is 1 month younger than Therese. Thus option (c) also doesn't match with this question. \n\nFinally, we will consider option d. From the information given, we see that Therse is 2 and 5 months older respectively than Aivo and Leon. So, for this situation, Therese has the highest gap between any 2 people. So, Leon has a gap of two months from Therese while Jolyn has a gap of two-months from Leon. So, Jolyn is two-months younger than Leon.

{"text": "70\n\n### Justification:\nTo answer this question, we first need to find Krystian\u2019s weekly borrowing rate. To do so, there are two pieces of numerical data provided, the daily borrowing rate of 40 books per day and the weekly borrowing rate of 60 books per week. We can combine these rates to obtain Krystian\u2019 free borrowing rate per week (FBRW). The formula for calculating this is: FBRW= ((40/30 \u22481,333)/14 \u2248 0,95) * ((60/30 \u00b11,333)= 5,666/ 14 = 0,4082. In other words, Krystian borrows 40 books per week on average.\nGiven this, what is Krystian\u2019 borrowing rate every Friday? We can calculate this too using the data provided. The answer is 1,45 or 40% higher. We can then derive the answer using this piece of information by finding the difference between the daily average and the Friday average. This gives us the difference which is 16 books every Friday. After 5 Fridays, this equals 80 books. Therefore, Krystian has to borrow a total of 90 books in a week.\nAnswer:90\n\n### Input:'A' was the best of a set of 8 letters. \n\n### Response:'X'\n\n### Justifcation:\n'The other five of these letters were \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\" and \"F\".\"''A' was the largest and therefore the best of the group.' \n'So, this sentence could mean a few different things. We have to consider our assumptions carefully to be sure we choose the correct option. \n'1.'We could assume that \"A\" is the first letter on the top of the list and \"X\" is another letter in the list. This could even be considered the most logical choice as the sentence gives us little other information that could help us decipher what 'A' means as it is so far away from the rest of the noun phrase and could potentially mean A means 'The letter 'A' that is the first letter on top of the list', or, A means", "answer": " 216"}
{"text": "The answer is: $10,000\n\nRationale:  \nThe question asks us first how much is John spending on the beef. This is what is called 'the unknown'. \n\nInside of the parentheses, you replace the variable with the answer. Here it is: $8,000\nNext, you subtract the two answers, which is $10,080 (since $8,00+$10,00=$18,000, and you take away) to find the cost of the beef for John. \nIf you think about it, you will be left with $16,000 after subtracting the beef cost.

{"text": "Firstly, we will need to clarify one part of the question. This is saying that for a heavy wash we are using the equivalent of 20 gallons per loads of laundry and for a regular wash the equivalent of 10 gallons per load of laundries. These quantities of water are equivalent to 20 gallons and 10 gallons respectively. This means we are using a washing machine that is capable of using 20 gallons or more of water in each load. The question doesn\u2019t give a specific value here, though it does give the values for a single wash. So, for a heavy wash the equivalent of the whole load, we need to use 30 gallons which is an increase of 10 gallon per load compared to a regular wash. If a load of laundry consumes 20 gallons for a heavy wash cycle and another 10 gallon for the regular wash, then we are using 30 gallons for a single wash, per load, and if there are two loads we now use 60 gallons. If we use 20 gallons extra for a light wash cycle this adds to 30 gallons (total 90 gallons), then for a heavy wash load the total is 120 gallons. Now we can get onto the questions:\n\n* How many gallons of bleach does the washing machine need\n  * The question is not asking this, since that is a different question. It is asking specifically how many gallons of water are needed in total.\n\n* How many light wash cycles does the washing machine include\n  * The question does not directly answer this, but we can use the information that is given to us to answer this, based on what the question is asking. Given the following scenario about the washing machine: \n\n* The washing machine uses 10 gallons for a regular wash and 2 gallons for a light wash.\n* For a light wash we use an extra cycle to rinse things thoroughly.\n* 20 gallons are used for a load of laundries in a single wash.\n* Bleach is used with 2 loads of laundry.\n\nWe can determine that for a regular wash we would use 15 gallons and for bleach cycle it", "answer": " 76"}

Then we have,\n\n`r = 2(a + b)` or `a + b = r/2`\n\nLet the number of days in November be `n`. By the principle of addition of likes, we have,\n\n\n\ta = 15(n-14)/14 = n - 15/14\n\n`b = n/2`, thus\n\n\t2*r = n -15/14 + n/2\n\nWhich simplifies to, `r = 2n/7 - 15/7`.\n\nNow, the sum of rain in November will be given by\n\n`r = \\sum _{i=1}^{n} a + r/i = 2\\sum _{i=1} ^n \\frac{i}{i+2} + \\frac{15}{7} = 7\\sum _{i=0}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{i+2} - 7 + 15/7`\n\nWe can now substitute `n-14` in the numerator of the summation.

Josh built his little brother a sandbox \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: the sun rising.  Choices: A: sun B: setting C: setting up D: setting in\nRationales: As per the context, the sun is being referred to. The sun rises in the east and sets in the west. The Sun rises in the morning which suggests that Sun is to the East. Similarly, Sun sets in the Evening which means that sun is to the west. \n\nThe first choice, \"sun\" is the general term, that can also be used for the moon and other heavenly bodies. It's not the sun in particular.\n\nThe second choice, \"setting\" is an action word that describes the process of making something ready or getting it arranged. It's unlikely that sun gets prepared, or that it is set anywhere.\n\nThe third choice, \"setting up\" is a phrase that describes the activity of building something and can be a suitable description of anything that gets ready to be used. Sun does not do these things, so doesn't apply to this question.\n\nThe fourth choice, \"setting in\" is a phrase with two similar meanings. One describes the setting of a sun - its descent below the horizon as it approaches dusk. The second meaning could describe sunlight itself setting on some scene or object as the day ends. These both make sense with the question about the time of day when the sun rises.\n\nThe final choice, \"setting down\", is a verb or action word that can be used to describe sitting, lying down, or placing a heavier item down carefully. It would be used for a sun that is about to be placed into a specific position, or for a sun that is sitting or lying down somewhere.\n\nEasily, the best choice is the fourth: there's no need to describe the position or actions of the sun - it's clearly implied by the time of day it rises.\n\nAnswer: D: setting in \n\nInput: What is the radius of the circle?

This can be simplified to \"Carla's car gets $2.50/$100 for every full gallon of gas.\"\n3. As $2.50 is the cost per gallon of gas, and the number of gallons consumed is 2.5 X miles, the cost would be 6.67 X miles.\n4. The above can further be simplified as the cost = (miles/8), so the cost = 4X cost of gas.\n5. So $8(cost of gas) = $100(amount needed to be paid)\n6. Since 8 dollars = 5 miles, each mile being 8 dollars, each gallon is $2 dollars.

{"text": "The total number of legs of remaining chairs is 2300.\n\n### Proof:Let's simplify the answer choices to make it easier to understand.\n### 1. A: Kenzo has 8400 tables and chairs.\n### \n### 2. B: If Kenzo has a total of 4300 units, the total number of legs would be the sum of all legs for each individual unit 4300=5+3=8. Hence, B is incorrect.\n### 3. C: If Kenzo had 21600 total legs, the percentage of legs used would have to be 40% of 2160=86. Hence, Kenzo's percentage of legs used would be greater than 86 so C is incorrect.\n## Solution:Answer Choices B and C are incorrect because of what the question asks: After a month 40 percent of the chairs are disposed of. Given this information, the question doesn't require the number of replaced chairs. Only the number of legs used is important.\nTo find the number of legs used, you need to compute for the proportion of replaced chairs.\nHere's what we need to do (the same procedure can also be used to find percentages in general):\n\n1. Count up the number of chairs and chairs' legs used.\nFor 80 office chains with 5 legs each, there would be a total of 400 legs used. Multiply this by 100 to get the percentage of furniture parts used.\n\n2. Multiply the percentage 400/500 = 80%\n\n3. Compare this percentage to the percentage of parts used 40%\n\nThe 5 and the 10 are the factors we picked for each solution.\n\nSo, the number of legs used:\n\n(80%)(80)/100 = (80)(4) = 320\n\nAdding to the original total of (400+320), we now have (720) legs.\n\nNow that we have the total number of the legs we need to subtract from the total count of furniture parts.\n\nThus, there are 800 (", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "1. Choose the appropriate operation and perform the calculation to find the answer.\n\n### Answer: 1. 2/3\n\n### Explanation:\nThe question asks in what ratio is Betty to her daughter to her granddaughter, such that her daughter is 40% of Betty's age and her granddaughters is 1/3 Betty's age. \n\nThere are three people, Betty, her daughter, and her granddaugther. Betty is X years old, her daughter is Y years old. Y is 40% X's age, thus Betty's daughter is (40/100)X years old. Betty's grand daughter is X/3 years old.\n\nSubstituting the values, X=50 and we get: Y=20, thus Betty, her daughter, Daughter and Granddaughter are 50,20, (20/50) and (50/3) respectively. Betty and her daughter are in a ratio of (20/5) or 4:1, which is the same as 1/2. Betty and her daughter's age ratio is 1/2. \n\nThis is 25/50 or 1/2 of their age. Betty and her daughter have ages 45 and 25 or X=45, Y=25. Betty's daughter is 20 years old and Betty's granddaughter, Daughter and Betty together are in a 25:25:20 age ratio which yields 2:2:1 \n\nGiven that Betty and her Granddaughter are age 50 and the granddaughters are a 1/3 of Betty's age Betty's granddaugther must be age 20. If Betty, Betty's daughter and her granddaugthers age are say 20, 40 and 60 then 20= 2^2 (4 years old) and 40=2^3 (6 years old) and 60=2^4 (8 years old), thus Betty's daughter can be 4 years older than her granddaugthers, which make her 24 yrs old. \n\nThus Betty's granddause", "answer": " 12"}

Velocity is measured in meters per second (m/s), and the formula to calculate velocity in these terms is velocity = distance / time.\n\nIn the case of the cheetah and gazelle, we can calculate the velocity using the following equation: \n\nVelocity = 60 x 1609 x (1/5259) = 11.11 m/s       \n\nThis means that for every single second the cheetah travels, we can add another 184 m to the distance it will travel. \n\nIn order to find how long it will take the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we can apply the formula for instantaneous rate of change d(c)/dt = (52)(51)(4)=28 and insert values to calculate how many seconds it will take for the cheetah to reach an initial distance of 238 feet behind and overtake the gazelle running at 40mph:\n\n(28/11.11) = 2.5 sec       \n\nAfter 2.5 seconds, the cheetah will be within 25 feet of the gazelle, which means that the gazelle that is currently running 40 m/h will have to speed its pace in order to sustain the lead he has.

The rest of those seagull will remain, they are the same seagulls that are now part of the parent set.\n\nHowever, since we now have new information (9 seagulls were scared off by the stones), a new set of seagulls can now be created. Let\u2019s call that new set the \u2018parent2\u2019.\n\nThat parent2 is made up of the same seagull that were part of the parent set at first, PLUS all the seagulls that were newly scared away by kids throwing stones.

All the money is left. So she had $88 dollars in total then half that leaves $44.

To find the square root to the nearest whole number, we subtract the square root of 5 from the square root of 64, which is 1, to get 3.0000. We then round off the answer to 3.\n\n### Question : Why does one get a different square root near a square when the digit is odd?\n\n### Demostration:\nWhen one computes the square root of an even number, we always get the full digit of the square that has the number.  Thus for a number like 8, we always get \u221a(8) = 2.  But not for the odd numbers, where rounding is necessary.  For example, 2 is a fraction with the odd digit of (1/2), and we round off the answer to a whole number to get the square root of 2.\n\nBut when it comes to the prime factor of odd numbers, it becomes more complicated.  Let\u2019s consider the example for 64.  We know that 64 = 24, so it has a prime factor with odd digits.   We can calculate the square root of 34 by squaring 2, and then take the square root: \u221a((2*2)) = 4, which is 4.  Therefore, the square of 64, 4096(squared), \u2248 65,536, but the square roots of 64, (64)^((1/2)) \u2248 4(4) = 16, which rounds off to get 4 as a square root of 63.  Therefore, while it is a roundoff, it happens for even numbers that have only a single odd digit.\n\nIn general, the square root of an odd number will be a whole number that is a multiple of the prime factor.  The reason for this is obvious if we consider how the square of", "answer": " 255"}

{"text": "$320\n\n### Input and Response Explanation: Tom can't afford a normal doctor but he can afford to go to discount clinic which is 70% less expensive than normal doctor that's why he prefers discount clinic over normal doctor. Tom took 2 doctors visit and the first doctor visit cost is $200, So total cost of 1 doctor visit is $400 for the first doctor visit. There are two total visit of a doctor and there are 70% discount of the second visit, But each visit is $200 each. So total cost of his visit in discount clinic is $320, so he saved $80.

{"text": "The correct answer to the riddle is to multiply $75 and 10, that makes $750 which is the price of the bed.

In order to solve the riddle correctly, we need to figure out how many apples Alice gets everyday and subtract that from 25. If there are no apples remaining after the subtraction is done, then Alice has no apples every day. If there are more than 25 apples left after the subtraction, Alice has more than 25 or apples in a day. The remaining solution of the riddle is as follows,\n`25 apples- 19 apples = 6 `\n\nThis is the answer to the final part of the question. However, in order to determine the amount of apples in a day, we need to get Alice\u2019s total amount of apples, which means that we must multiply 6 by 7 to get the total amount of apples Alice had everyday that week.

{"text": "They served a total 71 customers.\n\n### First thing's first. The total number of customers served must be the sum of the total number of customers served by Ann, Becky, and Julsy in each hour. Therefore, the total of customers served by Ann in the first hour must be added to the total of customers served in the first hour by Becky, then by Julia, and so on in a continuous loop until the end of the 8th hour. There are two main reasons why we do this in each hour instead of each customer: that Ann, Becky and Julia all work 8 hours at the pharmacy; and that each customer being served by each worker must account for only one customer in each hour (for simplicity's sake). \n\n### Secondly, each worker serves 7 customers per hour on average. If Ann is working, but Julia isn't, only 1 customer out of 7 for every hour passes her by. Thus, the total number of customers Ann served during one hour (for example the 3rd hour) is 66 because she started the hour serving 7 customers, and finished serving 7. This is in contrast to Becky who started the hour serving 5 customers and finished serving 5, for a total of 40. So the total number of customers the workers serve in the third hour is 66 plus 40, or 106. We continue until the end of the hour: 7+5+3+1=16. At the end of the first eight hours, each worker individually serves 171 customers total.

Choices: 1: 4 2: 10 3: 0.033 cm 4: 0.127 cm 5: 20 cm\nRationales: The question asks for the diameter of the sturdy cable. We will therefore have to figure out the exact metric system of measurement units that it is describing and then calculate the number of centimeters that is the diameter.\n\nStep 1: The question includes the phrases: \u201cneed to\u201d, \u201cas sturdy as possible\u201d, and \u201cthick\u201d. Therefore, we know that the diameter of the cable is describing the width and not the length of the cable.\n\nStep \t2: We see that there are only 5 choices. From the question that has been given, we know that the sturdiest cable must be the thickest one.

The staircases themselves are each referred to as 'climbs 2 feet'.\n\n#### Rationale for Step 1.\n\nStep 0: The question doesn\u2019t seem to describe that 'climbs' refers to the staircases, but to what the staircases 'climb'. They do not refer to themselves directly, but directly name the staircases they climb.\n\nStep 9: The question is referring to two separate staircases and only refers to them as 'climb 4 feet' and 'not climb 6 feet'. While the staircases are themselves referred to as 'climate 2 feet', they aren't referred to individually as 'climb 3 feet'. There is no implication given between the'staircases' and the 'climbs'.\n\nStep 0 : The question does not imply the context of all the staircases being referred to together, but rather, the question only uses 'climb' on the first staircases.\n\nStep 8: The question does not use 'climb' in conjunction with any individual staircase, but only when used in conjunction with the 'climbs' of the first staircase in combination with the 'climbing' of the '2 staircases'.\nStep 9: In the end, the only staircase referred to with a specific climbing action is the first staircase, with each of its staircases climbs '2 feet'.", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "In order to answer this question, we need to follow a step by step process.\n\n**STEP ONE:** Find the price of the dress without the cost of the discount.\n\nSTEP TWO: Figure out what 30% of the final cost of the store is.  That will tell us how much is being discounted from the final price.\n\n**SOLUTION:** The original price of the dress was $50.00. With the discount we would get a discount of 30% of that number, or 15 dollars.  This means that the discount on our dress is just $15.00.  $50.0 = $50 - $15 = $35.  $35 = 30% of $117.50.  $35 is the 30 percent off of the original price of the dress after the discount.  $50 - $35 = $15.  $50 = $50 + $15 = $65.  $65 is the final price of our dress after the discount is applied to the store.\n\n### Reference:\n\n<iframe height=\"245px\" width=\"669px\" style=\"border-style: ; border-width:0px 0px 0px; display:inline\" src=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/pre-algebra/mixed-operations-with-fractions/mixed-numbers-and-rationals-with-fractions-and-integers-practice-v/mixed-operators-fraction-simplification-new/v/how-to-solve-problems-that-involve-multiplication\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": "The grandmom gave $560\n\n### Input Jean has 3 grandchildren  She bought each grandkid 3 dolls for christmas and gives them 1 doll each birthday.  How many dolls are in all?\n\n### Demolition:\nLet's first understand what do the terms \"grandchildren\" and \"dolls\" mean\n\n1. To answer the first question, we need to define what exactly the term 'grandkid' means. There is no one standard definition. The dictionary definition is simply an offspring of the grandchild. We need to consider the context of the question.\n\n2. The term 'grandchild' in a sentence implies that it is an offspring of the 'grandmom'.\n\n3. Given the context, we can infer that the term 'grandkids' is referring to the combination of offspring of the grandchildren and thus the term in the question is 'grandkids' and not just 'grandkid'. \n\n4. We can now infer what 'doll' means in the context of the question and the word in the question is actually 'dolls'.\n5. It is possible that the grandmother buys each grandchild one doll for christmas, one doll on their birthday and then gives each grandchild two extra dolls, in which case the total number of dollars she gives will be $780.\n6. However, in the context of this problem, it is unlikely that this is the case. So, it is reasonable to assume that the grandmom gives each grandchild one extra doll on their birthday for a total of $600.\n7. To answer the question, we need to multiply $600 by 3 grandchildren.\n8. This leads us to a total of $1800, which is $360 less than what the question asks for.\n9. This difference suggests that the given information is insufficient to answer the question. However, if we further break down the information provided, we can see that it points us in the right direction and answer can be inferred.\n\n10. By considering the context of the given information, it is clear that the 'three dolls for Christmas' is a gift that the grandmom gave to each child on Christmas.

We have to solve 105/x=(7+8)/2\n  Since (7+8)/2=8/2 => 8-4=4\n  Now 105-4 =91.\n  Therefore (10/91)/x = 8/4 => x=8/3=3 or 3 is the dividend which 3 is the divisor.\n  Putting  x=3 as numerator and 105 as denominator, we have to find x.\n  x = (7+8)/3  X= (8+7)/3\n  Since X=9, (X-1)/3 =1+6 = 7/3\n  Hence x= 7/3= 2 and (2-1)/3 = 1/3\n  Therefore 1/3 =(2-1)/3= 1/3\n\n  Solving as shown,\n  3/(9-1)= 3/8\n      ==> 9/14= 7/14\n      ==> (3*7)/14=41/14\n      => (3/3)*41/14 =105/14.\n      X = 8/3, therefore, the numerator (X) = 7.

Subtract 4 from 105 to get 101.\nAdd 3 to 101 to get 104.\nMultiply 3 by 104 to get 312.\nDivide 312 by 8 to get 38.5.\nRound the answer to the nearest decimal = 40.\nHence, there 53 trips.  0 to 49, 50 to 104.

How many hours do you have to work per week to reach the same paycheck of $100,000 per year?\n\n### Task: \nAnswer the request.\n\n1. You have an extra 5-hour workweek where you make $60,050 a year.\n2. You then work eight hours the following workweek where you make an extra $3,615 dollars.\n3. Now you are working the equivalent of working 10 hours per week while making $63,665 a year.\n4.

So you need to earn $100,611.60 for the next year. You would earn $431.60 more than you did last year if you worked 10.5 extra hours.

Option \u2018A\u2019 would stand for the word \u2018happiness\u2019 in the expression \u2018Happy day\u2019 but this doesn\u2019t make sense in the given expression. Option \u2018C\u2019 is also incorrect and shouldn\u2019t stand for the word \u2018Happiness\u2019 as it would be redundant since \u2018HAPPY D\u2019 already means \u2018Happy Day\u2019. Option \u2018D\u2019 too should not stand for the word \u2018Hold back\u2019 as there is no reason to do so in our new expression and the \u2018H\u2019 in \u2018HAPPY\u2019 stands for the single word \u2018Happy\u2019. Option \u2018E\u2019 too does not work as the word \u2018Hard work\u2019 is not part of our new expression and would not be the correct answer as the \u2018H\u2019 in our new expression stands for the single word, \u2018HAPPY\u2019.\n3. Option \u2018B\u2019 would be the correct choice as it makes sense in the context of our new expression because \u201cHappiness is a happy day\u201d makes sense when we use the \u2018H\u2019 in the beginning to stand for \u2018happiness\u2019 and then use the \u2018H\u2019 at the end to stand for \u2018day\u2019. Therefore \u2018H, Happiness\u2019 would stand for \u2018HAPPY, HAPPY Day\u2019 and this makes option \u2018B\u2019 the correct choice.\n4.

Senses are something we use everyday, so it would be great if we could recall them from memory. If we cannot do that, then we could look these definitions up on the internet. \n\nFor each of the five senses listed in the question, we should write an instruction that lists 4 or more organs that are controlled by them.\nSo, for the five senses we know that we have 4 or more options for each sense because we already know what they are. \n\nSight: It is the sense that helps us to see, and the organs that control it are the eyes and the retina. The ears are the organs that control hearing. The nose is the organ that controls taste buds or flavour buds, and it controls the sense of smell. The mouth, tongue, and taste buds control taste as well.\n\nTouch: It is the sense we use to feel objects and the sensory organ of touch. The skin controls the sense of touch.

{"text": "The answer is 13\n\n### Rationale:Step: 1 - We note that we need to find out how many sweets were on table at first. We need to subtract the sweets that Jack took and the sweets that Paul took.\nStep: 2 -The sweets that Jack took is 'half of all the candies'. This means that he took half of all the sweets that were there. So, the sweets that remained on the table is the remaining 7 + half of 13.\nStep: 3 - The sweets that the Paul took is 1 more + 1/7 * 13.\nThe answer to the question is: The remaining sweets after both the parties took is 1 + 1/7* 13, where 13 is the number of sweets that were there previously.\nStep: 4 - Thus, the number of sweets on the table at first is 1 + 7/7 = 8.\nStep: 5 - We know that adding 7 and the number of sweets left on the table after both the parties took sweets, the answer is 14 = the remaining number of sweets.\nStep: 6 - So, we can say that there were 14 sweets on the table originally.\nThe number of sweets after Jack took half of all the candy is 14 - 4 = 10. 10 is the number of sweats that Jack took. \nThe number of sweats after Paul took 7 more is 14 - (1/7)*13 = 10.\nTherefore, the number of sweats 10 + 10 = 20.\nHence, the number of sweet Jack took and Paul took was 10.\nThe number of original sweets left after both the Jack and Paul took the sweets is 14 -10 - 10 = 4.\n\nHence, 4 are the number of sweets remaining on the table after both Jack and Paul took the number of sweets. This number is added to the original number of sweets = 14 = 14 + 4 = 18 is the number of sweat left on the table after Jack and Paul took all the sweets.\n\nTherefore, there were a total of 1", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": "The correct answer is A: 4.7 square feet.\n\nLet's start by looking at the question as a whole and identifying the three unknown values that must be found:\n\n- One present needs two square feets\n- The second present needs 3-quarters of that\n- The third present needs the amount of wrapping paper for both of the other presents put together.\n\nNext, the statement \"all three presents\" means that all the presents will need the same amount of wrapping paper.\n\nThen we can work through each of the unknowns one by one. We can then see how to use these values to answer our final question.\n\n* The first unknown is represented by \"one present.\" Since we don't know what the size of this present is, we can't find the number of square feet\n* The second unknown is represented by \"two square feets\" in question 3, which is the required wrapping amount for the second present. The second unknown is only present as a limit for the size of the present, not as a measured number, like the third present, which we already know needs the size of all the other presents. Thus, we can use the second present to calculate the number of square feet by subtracting the square feet needed for each respective present. This leads us to: 'Subtract the number needed by the first present, and we have 1.5 square feet'\n* The third unknown is represented by \"amount of wrapping paper for both presents.\" We will now find the number of square feets for just the first present by adding these two numbers together. This leads to the final number of 4.5 square feets.\n* Once you have 4.5 square feet, you can multiply it by 3 - since there are 3 presents, which makes 13.5 square feets in wrapping paper. The correct answer is A 4.7 square feets.", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "If Parker is 4 inches shorter, then she is 4 inches shorter from 60 inches. Thus, she is 56 inches tall. Daisy is x inches taller. Her answer is 60 + (d + 4) inches, which equals 69 inches. Subtract 56 and 69 respectively to get 24 and 15 inches. The height of Reese is 66 inches, which is a prime number. Then, the average height of the 3 of them is 56 + 15 + 66/3.\n\n### Rationales\nThe first step is to simplify everything to get to the answers you can use to average Parker, Daisy, and Reese. We know to subtract Parker's height from Daisy's to get 56+15. This formula is easy to use because you know it for the height of one of the 4 people. You can then divide two of these answers: 56 and 15. To divide we use the word \"divide by\" and the symbol /. Then 15/2 comes out to 7.5. The correct formula is 56 / 3 = 18.75. The fraction bar tells us to divide the numerator of the top (15) with the denominator (56), and the answer should always be in simplest form. The numerator on the bottom equals 7.5. We have to take the answer and put it in decimals. To do that, 7.5 times 2 equals 15. This leaves us with 18.7. This is just above the two decimal point. This means 0.7 would be in the denominator (the bottom right number in the decimal). When done this way an average height of the three was 18.7 +0.7 = 19.4 inches tall.\n\n### Input:[link](https://www.khanacademy.org/partner-content/american-express/amers-math/v/grade-5-lesson-4--multiplication). \nHere we are going to be learning a bit more about multiplication\n\n### Response:[link]\nThis is a great video that will go beyond the normal learning about multiplication.

Therefore the total area of the room equals A+B+C+D. We also know that each can of paint covers an area of 2 square meters. \nThus the total area the can of paint covers: (A + B + C +D) * 2. Thus, we have the equation of Area of can of paint = Total area of room \nTherefore, A/total area = area of one can of paint.\nThus, total area of 4 cans of paint = total area of room. Solving for L we get 8. Therefore, Lucille needs to buy eight can of paint.\n\n### Rationale:\nFirstly we look at the question, two of the wall are 3 meters, and one of the wall is 5 meters, and one of is 4 meters. We know that each can of is paint is 2 square meters. Therefore if we know the area of each can of paint we can solve the equation.

How long did it take Joseph and the friends to cook and watch movies?\n\nThe given data is :\n\n2. 1 hour and 20 minutes long for the first movie.\n\n3. While cooking, they spent:\n\n3. 10 minutes to make popcorn and twice the duration to make fries.\n\nTo solve the question, first, let us understand what is meant by movie's duration and the data.\n\nFor the first movie, it is represented as a \"1:\" sign to indicate that it is less than an hour, and for the second movie, it as a \"2:\" to indicate that it is greater than the first one. In the above data, the duration of the first movie is 1 : 30 to indicate that it is 1hr. and 30 mins.\nThe next step is to calculate the total duration of the two movies together which is 1hr 50 mins which is a sum of the movie 1's duration (1hr. : 30mins) and movie 2's duration.\n4. Now we have to consider the time required for making popcorn and fries during the time of cooking.\n\nNow, the time taken for cooking fries is 2 times that of the time taken for making popcorn. Because they took twice the time for making fries than for making popcorn; we have to multiply the time taken for making the popcorn by 2.\n\nRoughly, they took about 50 mins for making the popcorm, so twice the popcorn duration would be 100 mins or 1 hr and 40 mins.\nSo, the time they spent on cooking popcorn and fry for the duration of 1 hr 40 mins during making movies.\nSo, Total time spent in making poppers and fries = 1hr, 40mins.\n\nNext, let us consider the time the friends spent for making popcorn, which is 50 minutes, and again we need to multiply the popcorn time by 2 since it is twice the time", "answer": " 4"}

Let us assume that his body is not fatigued and that he does not eat or drink, and continue with the next problem where it will get complicated.\n\n### Response (Explanation):  Because it's a record, Mark would not want the answer to be less than 54,016, because any lower will not qualify him to have the most consecutive ropes jumps record and therefore Mark has to figure out how to obtain 54016 in the shortest amount of time.  Now he multiply 54015 jump/sec * 3 jump/sec.  The answer from the above computation is 160.6 minutes which is less than the available total time in a day, therefore he needs to get the record in the shortest amount to days possible which is 9.35*54015/3= 8 hours and 34 seconds.\n\n### Problem:Bananas are on sale.

Let us multiply S.  B to find out how much money Sally need in order to consume the 50 day banana sale.  Now, Sally needs to figure out in order to acquire the most bananas for a total money amount.  Therefore, she multiply S.  B * 5 / 0.5(for every 0.5 days) for 50 days on the total price.  The total price will be $50, let us say.

This indicates that the verb to \"walk\" is unnecessary because there is no additional information about what the subject is doing, so it is a fragment of a thought. I also gave an example of a sentence that has a predicate and has a subject in the middle. I concluded on this example that they are related. But the thing about this predicate is that it has a tense in it that indicates it is happening at some point in the past. I went on to elaborate that the verb is missing from the example I had and was thus a fragment of a thought, so we go ahead and fix it. I am going on to the next example that I gave as not having enough information to explain since it was about the sentence being missing a word.

{"text": "The plums were 4 of them.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The question asks how many plums Tanya bought, rather than how much, and so we should look at the amount of fruit she bought, rather than the weight of the bag.\n\n2. This also means that the bag is irrelevant, and that Tanya probably should not have put everything from the fruit in that bag.\n\n3. The number of plums that she bought can be calculated by subtracting the numbers of fruit that fell out of the bag from the number of fruit she still has in the bag, after she counts the fruit again (we can assume that the bag is empty because when the fruit fell out, there will be no fruit left in the bag).\n\n4.

I had teachers that were very difficult to understand, and a work ethic that sometimes required taking my time. This led to me scoring 1590/1600 on my SAT. As a result, I was one of the thousands of applicants to Dartmouth College. During my time at Dartmouth, I took several courses that provided me with some useful knowledge about how to prepare students for taking the SAT. \n\nThe courses focused on several main concepts:\n1- You may be tested at any time, even if you have taken two hours to complete it. The person who gave me my SAT scores said there's a 25/75 distribution of time to complete the test. In other words, approximately one-quarter of the students did two hours, approximately one-quarer took three hours, etc.\n2- The reading section of the SAT tests your ability to read in between the lines of stories and texts. \n\n\n\n\n\nI am looking for a teaching assistant position in college mathematics or philosophy (in that order).\n\nMy teaching experience has not been too extensive, but has been very positive.

Therefore, fuel will always be pumped into gas station.\n2. Cars are typically mechaniced in a garage. The garage might include a service machine which is required for fuelling the car.\n3. Cars are often serviced or repaired in a garage or mechanic shop. Therefore, gas tank may be emptied and refilled at a garage or a mechanic shop.\n  4.

We have to determine the total number of gifts John received during the span of two birthdays. From the choices given, 66 is the only option that provides a total close to the number of gifts John actually received. Based on the problem statement, it was clear that John received 20 on his 12st birthday and 8 less than that on his 13st birthday. Thus to solve the problem we simply add both values. When 12 is added to 8 the sum is 20 which is John\u2019s birthday gift on his 12tst birthday. To get the number of birthday gifts he received John needs to receive 28 more gifts. When we add 28 to the 20 we receive a result of 48 which is not in the choices given. To be precise he received 49 gifts.

The word \"total\" in the options suggests that there are more than 5 candles on the tree, as they would be added per year. Further, the word \"candles\" is plural, and it suggests that there is more than one type of \"candle\". This indicates that there are more than one of each type of \"candles\", suggesting that there are more than just 5 of each per year. Therefore, option 2 is the correct answer.\nOption B: Option 1 has no context clues as to what \"5 candles per year\" means, or how. The context clues from the second option indicate that there are candles that are lit per year. This suggests that there is some kind of event that occurs on a regular basis, thus indicating that the term \"year\" is used in a colloquial sense.

If there are 48 flyers, Donna must have dropped off one extra flyer. However, since they dropped off the same number of flyers, 48 of them, Donna dropped off 1 extra flyer over the combined amount of 48 that both Maisie and Donna dropped.\n\nSince Donna dropped off 3 more flyers than Maisie, the answer must be C: 16.\n\n### Input:$70+$4$+$75$+$6$+$12$, what is the value of $b$?\n\n### Response:$12$\n\n### Exa:This can be solved using two 5 step patterns, to get $10, 20, 30, 12$. First we can multiply $4$ with a 5 step pattern, starting at $12$. We multiply $4x12 = 48$. After doing this, we subtract $75$ from $48$. We then subtract $70$ from the answer, 35. When we subtract our answer by $75$ we get $0$. When we subtract $70$ (since $48<75$ we get) 15. After this, we add another 5 step pattern, and we multiply $15\\times 5 = 75$ since we start off at $75$. When we solve after we have all these multiple steps, the answer is $12$.\n\n### Input:\"I don't know what to do.

Choices: 21 minutes 61 minutes 121 minutes 331 minutes 414 minutes 633 minutes\nRationales: After a while, we can assume that a while means a relatively long period of time. Since a while is defined as a relatively long period of  time, it would make sense to assume that the time taken to wash all dishes is more than the amount of time we would typically spend washing a single tray of dishes. Considering choices:\n\n1. 61 minutes. 1 minute per dish, 61 dishes.\n\n2. 331 minutes. 5 minutes per dish, 70 dishes\n\n3. 121 minutes. 2 minutes per dish,\n\n4. 414 minutes. 3 minutes per dish, which would take over 3 hours to wash every dish.\n\n5. 633 minutes. 4 minutes per dish, more than anyone would take to wash all the dishes on the table.\n\n6. 21 minutes.

{"text": "Robert saved $150 in a year.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe task requires the amount for the last month be found by comparing the other months. The total amount for the first half of the year (January - July) is $150. If she saves $10 per month throughout that time period, then she will have $150 throughout the entire year.\n\nThe final month's amount (December) can be divided by her savings rate (how much she saves per month - $10 here) to obtain how many amounts saved in $10 will equal the $150. We know she saves $10 the first half of the month. This also shows that she saves $10 throughout the year ($10/month x 12 months).\n\nSo the answer is that she saves $150 + $10(January).\n\nAnswer: $150 + 10(Janu)", "answer": " 20"}

Choices:  A I need to go B I need to buy C I need to eat D All of the above are wrong E There is no error \nRationales: Here's a link to the video of the solution: https://youtu.be/lxZLU0uR1_A\nWe can try to match each choice to one of the options in the question: 'I'll just write another' is only a sentence, therefore it is incorrect in response to the question. 'Another sentence here,' is a shortened version of the previous sentence, so it is incorrect. Like the previous choice, 'I need to go' is just a sentence. 'Need to buy' is not a complete sentence which would answer the question. 'Need to eat' does make a bit more sense, but there is some confusion between 'need to' and 'need to say,' and 'eat' is a bit unclear. Answer: E. There is no error.

Choices:  Day 1 A 17 B 20 C 25 D 31 E 31 but all are not correct\nRationales: Let's first look at what is asked. How do we find the answer? We need to know how many days are in the month. Month length can vary from 28 to 31 days but the sum of all days in a month is always 30 or 31 depending what month it is. Let's count down the days starting from the 1st. The first Tuesday is on the 7th then we need to calculate the day that is both the first Tuesday as well as the Wednesday birthday, which will then be a Wednesday.

{"text": "The answer is 750 bottles.  Let's look at the scenario of hosting a party to figure out how many bottles will be drunk.\n1. 1,200 bottles of wine at a party: 1,201 bottles is too large to be the answer.\n2. 60% of bottles at a party: 960 bottles is just too high to be the answer.  One would likely run out of wine before attending that long of a party.\n3. 480 bottles at a party 480+0.66 of 480 will not give us a bottle count anywhere close to 750.\n4. We only got one answer that works - 450 bottles. Subtract 450 from 2400 and we will have 1900 left over.  At a party, people will likely consume about half of the bottles.  So that is 450 * 0.5 = 225 left over. \n5. We subtract our bottle amount we started with from what we have remaining: 2400 - 225 = 2175 left over.  A little math gets us 2175/75 = 300 which is too high. \n6. 450 bottled.  We can use this because 1900 bottles were used.\n7. The amount of bottles = bottles used at a party.  We can also solve this equation for X to get 2400 = 1900 + X 400X = 200\n8. 400 * 75 which is too high.\n9. The difference between bottles in the cellar is 450 minus 2400.  (2400-450) = 1950 left\n10. The bottles consumed at a party with 450 bottle of wine would be: 1900 - 450 = 1450 bottles of wine consumed.  The rest - 450 - 1950 would be a bottlecount of 1600.

The girl would be 375cm tall and the boy, 375cm-30=345cm. 170cm is not a possible height for the boy.\n\nC: An answer of 350 is impossible as well. If the girl is 475cm tall and boy is 475+30+30=515cm tall, it's still impossible because the sum of their heights would be 1115cm which exceeds the maximum height of 600cm in the question.\n\nD: An answer of 450 is also impossible as we get two values that would exceed the maximum height indicated by the question: girl 655cm or boy 655-30=525cm\n\nE: The correct answer choice is 165.

We can calculate ruths part as 3x, Ruth's part = 1 : 3.\n\nAs she got 1x(because sam gave x to her), x is her share.\n\nShe want double of that share and get triple of her share as 1x.\n\nSo in ruths case 1x = 3x \n\nSo her total = 3x.\n\n\nThen Amy part = 2 : 3\n\nSo Sandra's part is 50 which means 1x = 50.\n\nThis way we can calculate the ratio and total.\n\nLet's calculate sandras share.\n\nHer share = 100.\n\nAmy's share = r*s = 1*30 = 30\n\nSo sandra's share = 10 - 30 = 20\n\n\nThis way we answer \"Sandra got $50\" in context of the question, that is Sam shared a sum of money b/w 3 cousins and Amy, Sandra and Ruth.  \n\n### Input :\nWhat was happening in the forest? \n\n\nInput Choices:A : A pack of wolves was killing deer B : Deer was being eaten up by the lions.

If the plumber charges the stated prices, it would cost the plumber $3 \u00d7 4 + 4 \u00d7 2 + 4 \u00d7 3 = $104, whereas the plumber would earn $216 with the option C.\n\nOption C, with the highest earnings, is actually the second highest earnings option given the information.

So A is the highest cost to the plumber with the least amount of money earned.\n\nOption B contains both a toilet and sink so it is more profitable than A.

This requires the user to either have a bathtup or bathtub, which can be found throughout any house as it is primarily used fro bathing.

So, we should have used a unit of 4 and not 3 in the first challenge. The first challenge refers to how many hours Melissa has to work. So, if we assume that she can produce 56 dresses, 16 is approximately 1/3 of the quantity. So, we should multiply 16 by 4 so that our answer is 64.

{"text": "The answer to the question is 6, because John only needs 3 different reams of paper.\n\n### Cleaning the Pool\n\nThis problem illustrates a situation in which it is imperative to use a formula to produce the correct answer. \n\nJohn is very enthusiastic about fixing up his pool,  pool maintenance is one of John\u2019s specialties. To John, the pool is the centerpiece of his property and John enjoys swimming in it on even the worst days. John's pool does not require any additional filters or filtration systems, although it does have a pool cleaner system.  \nThe question here then is,  'How many bags of pool cleaner does John need?' We need a formula.  John's pool has a volume of 10,000 liters,  which is the amount of space that the pool occupies in liters. This means that if the pool water reaches 1.2 meters deep, that this water has a volume of 8.645 cubic metres, and is  thus,  '8.645 meters cubed.'  It should be noted that a cubic metre is just a mathematical unit of length or size, not a physical, material object.  'Pools' are a type of volume, just like other volumes such as \"bath tubs\" or \"downtown districts.\"  There  are many pools throughout the globe that have similar sizes,  therefore if you  know the size of a pool\u2019s cubic volume, it is very easy to determine its size in volume units. If you have ever ordered something online and had to pick a size for it, then you have likely worked  with litres.\n\nJohn\u2019s pool does not contain just water, it contains chlorine. John adds at least 200 gallons of chlorine to the pool per week. A gallon is a unit of measurement that denotes the volume of a unit of water, but a gallon is used differently in the U.S. compared to other nations. \n\n### How many bags of pool chlorine does John use annually?\n\n### Formula: 10,080 divided by 182 equals 56.3 bags of pool chorine per year. 56.3 is the amount of litres", "answer": " 3"}

This implies that the box isn't specifically identified or even that it is a particular box but a just a box. \nStep 2: Considering Option 2: This indicates an object identified with the subject 'I have' and followed by \"Donuts\". This suggests that the sentence is a description of an individual donut and not the whole box.\n\nStep 8: Option 3: This option has the structure of having a certain quantity of something, followed by the preposition 'of\" and another noun in the same number, followed by the indefinite article 'A' and then the name of an object.

The total number of red notes is 5 x 6 = 30\n\n2. The number of blue notes present in one row is 5x6 = 30 and in the five rows, it is the product of 5x6 =30x5=150\n\n3. The total number of blue notes scattered at the end is 5x10 = 50\n\n4. Total number of blue notes is 150 + 50 = 200.\nBut, 200 is the total notes of both blue and red combined.

Matthew typically only assembles the ingredients required for his caramel apple coffee.  He also uses the same ingredients to produce other baked food items. He needs to get 450 grams of whole-wheat pastry flour, 300 grams of cane sugar, 150 grams of pure vanilla extract and 300 grims of cocoa powder to make his caramel apple cake. We can figure the assembly time for Matthew's famous caramel apple coffee to be around 47 minutes.\n\n> The cake mix was the same for every single cake they made. That includes ingredients, measurements and total time it took Matthew to complete the mix.\n\nStep \n\nStep 3) Understanding the numbers (operationalization\n\nA typical cup of caramel can be made in just over eight minutes. Matthew often makes caramel apple coffee in half the time it takes most people to make one. That is two minutes of labor, using a pan that holds seven cubic feet and a heat source that holds 150 watts.\n\n> Matthew bakes the cake in two three-minute stages in", "answer": " 5"}

And if she bought x rose stamps and x truck stamps overall, then x was between 1 and 9. This makes total of x truck stamps and x rose stamps between 1 and 19. Since we have more choices here than we have numbers, this means (a) x < 11, (b) 11 < 4x, (c) x > 4y, (d) 4x > 4y.\n\n**Step 2:** The answer is 11. There are x truck stamps. x has to be < 11 but 11 < x. Only a solution satisfies both these equations. This solution is 11.\n\n### Solution:\n1. Bella bought 4 snowflake staps and 12 truck stamps.\n2. If x means number of trucks stamps and y means no. of rose stamps, then 4x + 12 = 11y.\n3. x has to be between 1 and 5 (since x cannot be more than 11). So, from equation 2, 1 = 5x - 12 + 12.

{"text": "The correct response is D: $54.\n\n### Detailed Explanation:\n\n### Demystify:\n1. Considering the entire sentence, you are given some important information about Mary's grocery shopping habits. \n2. She does her shoing every Saturday at a specific store. It is important to remember where and when Mary does her grocery because you will need to use those specifics to solve the question.\n3. Mary's Credit Limit is $100, she spends the full credit limit and must pay it before her next grocery shopping trip. These details tell you that you have to pay the credit balance before leaving the store. \n4. On Friday Mary spends $55 of the limit. This tells you that before your next shopping trip, you need to pay remaining $45 of the credit limit.\n5. On Saturday she spends the remaining $45, meaning you need to pay $45 more to completely pay for the credit limit. \nThese facts are crucial to solving the question.\n\n## Demonstration: \n\n### Response\nYou can solve this question by breaking the steps by yourself. \n\n1. First figure out where she does grocery: She does grocery on Saturday, so the first thing to do is calculate the spends Mary has made on shopping. \n\n### Answer\nWe can easily conclude that Mary spent the whole of her limit on both Friday and Saturday. It is imperative to notice that the payment is to pay before the shopping, so the payment should be calculated immediately.\n\n### Answer step 1.5\n\nTo pay this credit, Mary needs to pay $45 as given in the problem.\n\n### Finalizing the question\nMary's credit limit after spending both Friday and Saturday is $100- $45=$55 remaining on her credit. So on friday Mary has $55 spends and on Saturday she has $45 spends, so she paid $45 to complete her credit limit and now she spent all the $55 from saturday, after paying, she must pay $45 to complete paying for her next shopping trip, so she must spend $45 on saturday again to pay for the next shopping trip.", "answer": " 62"}

Choices:  I: bingo\n\nI: bingo\n\nII: draw\n\nRationales:\n1. This is a question which asks for a statement answering the question. So the first and foremost step to answer this question is to pick the right option.\n2. Option I: bingo: this option is the best choice because winning games of chance like bingo involve skill, as players mark off numbers on a bingo card. So the bingo card must have a winning combination. Hence the probability that the bingo card will win is less. \n3. Option II: draw\nDraw: draw involves playing with a lottery ticket, just crossing the numbers. There is more chance to win in draw. Winning chances are more, because of the lesser skill involved.\n4.

None of these options corresponds to the description of machine in the question, so A is not a correct choice. The third option, C, suggests that the machine is a set of tools or equipment, which can sometimes be complex or intricate.

This can also been shown as the base 10 representation 8/12 or 011000110.\n\n### Answer to the question: What percentage of Americans enjoyed the new movie?\n\n\n### Demostration:1. This number isn\u2019t 0.666\u2026 or 67% because it\u2019s not rounded to the 10,000th position. 67% doesn\u2019t represent this number. \n2. However 67% does represent this same number in another way. Think about this like another way of representing a decimal number.\n3. In base 10 we have a number like 5 that is equal to the number 010001. If we were working in the base 2 we would have the number 0110 which would be the number 01.\n4. In this scenario 5 is 01001 in the base 10 but 0110 in the base 2.\n5. The same thing works of course in reverse as well. Think of 0110 as being equal to 5 in the base 2 and the base 10 of this number is 011011.\n6. Hence the 1 is being repeated to represent the base 2 number 5.\n7. Since 0110 is equal to 5 in base 2, this would also mean that 0110 represents 5 in base 10.\n8. Therefore, we can rewrite our decimal number as 0110 and we see that our decimal number, 0110, is actually equal to 67%.\n\n### Demosntrate what number is greater:112 or 112\n### Answer:Greater Than", "answer": " 840"}

Therefore we can equate the question as 18K=100k boys, where we can then solve for k which gives 0.526k. \n\nThen we can substitute 18 for k to give 18=100(0.526) so that 18/100=0.526. Hence 18% of the kids/bunnies in the family are boys.", "answer": " 920"}

Then multiply the second term twice to get (2n) x (n-1). Then multiply (2n) x\n  (n-1) once again to get (2n x (n - 1)).\n\n* The third step is to multiply the last term (2n) x n twice and you get 2n^2 x (n - 2). Then multiply (2nd part of sum) x (2nd part\n  of sum) and you get (2n^2 x n) x * (n -1) x n-2.\n* To simplify this part, we multiply both parts and get 2n^3 x (n - 3) which is our final answer!

{"text": "Answer: $80 or $81\n#### Rationale:  The problem is as follows:  Missy had a giant pigg bank in her bedroom, every day she search the house for change. after 4 years the bank was opened and contain $450 in Change. If the second, third and fourth years she double the amount she put in bank from previous year. how much money in dollars does she put in the bank first year. The question asks how much money does she put in the first year therefore the amount must start from $0. This can only happen if she puts money in the bank for the first year.

This change is caused by the change in the sun's position relative to the Earth. Every day, the Sun rises due east. This is where the Sun is always in the sky at the same time. From \n\nspring to fall, the Sun comes up earlier and earlier each day in the northern hemisphere and later and later each day in the southern hemisphere. Therefore, in the northern hemispheres days get shorter and shorter, and in the southern hemispheres days are longer and longer.\n\n#### Rationale-\nThis happens to the Earth because when we are in the northern hemisphre and the Sun is in a direct line with us, due East the Sun is very warm we can tell this is true because our plants respond by blooming they also need cold weather and water which they will also need because without water they will also die. So in the summer we need much cooler temperatures and the opposite if we stay in the northern hemispeher at the same latitude and go south you will start to have warmer days then winters and the longer it gets the colder it gets also the less light there is so it starts to get dark so much earlier. So the Earth is rotating and during the summer it is warmer and in spring and summer due to the Sun's position relative to earth, during this time plant life changes their growth patterns to bloom and the flowers start blooming. When they bloom their flowers", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": "The correct solution to this problem is:\n\n$$n = \\frac{400 * 0.2 - (8)(600/400)}{0.2} \\approx 7$$\nRationale: This problem requires that we solve for n in the equation: $$ (20 * 1 = x*y) $$ where 1 and y are given values and x is unknown. \n\nThe equation, written in it's standard form, is: $$ \\frac{ 600 - 20*8}{8} = x $$.\n\nThe denominator of each side of this equation is $8$; $8$ is what we're multiplying the numerator and denominator by, so diving by $8$ on each side of the equation is the same as multiplying by $1/8$. Therefore, in order to solve for the equation, we need to find $n$, where: $n = 8$.\n\nOnce we know that $n = 8$, we can calculate the value or x in the equation. In order to do so, we need to determine the ratio of x to y, where x and y are both given. Therefore, we can simply write: \n\n$$ \\frac{ x }{ y } = r $$.\n\nBased on the given information, $x$ equals 20 gallons and 'y' equals 600 miles. We can multiply those two values by 1/8 to get the numerator, and the denominator remains $8$. When we multiply the numerator and denominators by 1/8, we get:\n\n$$ \\frac{(20 * 1/8)}{8} = r $$.\nThis would be simplified to:\n\n$$ \\rlap\\frac{8}{8} = r $$, which reduces to: \n\n$$ 1 = r $$.\nWe're told that x equals 20 gallon and y equals 600 mile. Therefore, given those constraints, the answer to the riddle is:\n\n$$ 1 * 600/20 = r $$\n$$ \\frac{ 6}{5} \\text {gallons of gas } $$\n$$ \\rlap 7 \\text { gallons of gas } $$", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "To answer the question we first need to think through the logic behind it. The question is asking about how many times coffee will last Angie if she drinks 3 cuppers each day. We can break it into three parts to solve this equation.\n\nFirst, Angie buys 3lb of coffee each week. This is 3lb/7days which is.43lb each day. We need to know how much one lb of coffee can make in terms of a fraction of how many cups it would make for a day.\n\nThe second part is about how much Angie drink each day. Divide 40 (from how many cups from I cup of coffee) by how much she drinks (in terms of cups) per day.\n\nThe last part is about how many days it would last her.  Since we already know 3 days it would last her, we just need to divide the # of days Angie drinks coffee each day by how much one lb of brew makes the average of cups per day.  So, we just need to know how much 1 lb of coffee would make average.\n\nDivide that amount with the amount of cups Angie drinks average a day.\n\n\n### Input\n\n### Demostraition:\nWe can see that Angie takes home 1.5 pounds of coffee a day. We know Angie drinks 40 cups a day and that 1.5 lbs make 144 cups a day so we can use the formula that.82 will give us 82 cups of coffee per pound. So 1.5 pounds will give Angie 122 cups per day and we already know she drink 40 a day, well 40 + 122 is 162 cups in a week.\n\nThe answer would be: 162 drinks of coffee in a week from Angie.\n\n# Task: The Task\n\n### Input \n\n### Response\n\nTo solve the mathematical equation using your computer we would use the long hand method which will then solve for x as\n\n$(x+40)*(\\frac{x-3}{2})=8x-12$\n\nNow we plug in numbers to solve the equation above, since our starting value is 45 I will plug", "answer": " 40"}

How many tires do the 24 vehicles have in all?\n\nRationales:\n\n1. The question asks for a way to solve the above equation without the need for tables or spreadsheets.\n2. Since this question has two possible answers, i.e. the first answer is A and the second answer is B, the best way to solve this question is to make a decision tree, where each node represents: \"I have found a matching set\".\n3. In this example, each set has two matching values, for example A can be either A or B and B can be either A or 2.\n4. The node that shows \"I have found a match\" means I have found one of the two matching choices. This is the equivalent of asking the question as:\n\n\"I have found a tire on the used car lot that is either A or B. How many of the total number of tires are A or B?\"\n\n5. This, in turn, can lead back to the original question, which can be answered \"there are 2 tires on the used car lot. The first tire is either A or B, and the second tire is either A, B or 2.\"\n7. \"The first tire is either 4 or 2 wheels. The second tire is either 2 or 4, so the answer is 4 tires.\"\n7.

We notice that $40= 3\\times2^2$ and $119=13\\times2^3$. If we compare the power of $3$, which is represented by $2^3=8$, we get that $119\\leq(3\\times2^4)\\times40=119$.

{"text": "Suraya picked 13 more apples than Kayla.\n\n### Rationale:\nLet's have our own calculation.  \nFirst, we need to write the formula to calculate how many apples did Kayla picked than Suraya. We calculate the difference between Suraya's apples and Kayla's apples. As we know that we already got the information that Caleb picked 12 appled than Suraya and Suraya picked 13 apples than Kayla we can do this calculation.  \nSo we can get the formula to calculate how to many apples did Kayal picked than Suraya is \"Suraya's apples-Caleb's apples = Kayla's applw\". We plug the value for the information  we have got in the formula to make it look like this:\n$Suraya's appies - Caleb's appies = Kayla's appsled$\n$Suraya picked 5 apples than Caleb - Kayla picked 15 apples$\nAnd after finish this step, I make the graph to solve the question. I found this image in the internet so I just use this image to get the graph. There are 2 things that I found very important in this line. First, I can see that the line for Suraya's applw is higher than the lines for Caleb and Kayla. This is mean that the line for Surat's apples is greater than the other two line. Second, if we look at the graph it can be seen that the line for Caleb is lower than the line for Kayla. This is means the line for Cale's apple is less than the line for Kay's apples. Third, if we look at Suraya's graph it can be seen the line for Suraya is greater than line for Kayla and the line for Kayla is greater than the line for Cale, this mean if we draw a line on this, we can see that line for Suraya and line for Kayla is the same line, so they must be different or greater than the line for Kay or less than the line for Cay. If we draw the line on the graph and check the graph then we can see that the line that's different from the Kayla's line must be higher than and different to the line of Caleb and", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "The elevator sign reads \"Maximum weight 660 pounds.\"\n\n### Demostration:\nThe weights of the two children are much lighter than the average weight of the three adults, so the children are not included in calculating the total weight of the people in the elevator.\nIn addition, the sign reads \"Maximum load 660 pounds,\" which means that the maximum weight of any single person is 660 pounds, not half of that amount.\nAlso, the weights of the passengers need to be added together in order to determine whether or not the total weight is greater than 660 pounds. Since the maximum weight limit is 140 + 140 + (1.2 x 64) < 660, we can deduct that the additional passenger's weight does not add to an additional 600 pounds as stated in the question\n\nIn order to maximize the capacity of the elevator you want to keep the number of passengers equal to or less than the capacity, you'd need a maximum of: The maximum capacity of an elevator is 660.\n\n### Justification:\nIn order to determine the maximum weight, you need to:\n\n1. Determine the average weight of the people already in the elevator\n2. Determine the total weight of that group of passengers\n3. Subtract \"the average weight of the group of passengers\" from \"the total weight of the group of people\" to equal 600\n\n### Excluding the passengers from the elevator:\nThe sign explicitly says that the maximum weight of the elevator is 600. We can eliminate the answer choice that says this weight does not include passengers' weights, as this would clearly contradict the sign's requirement by allowing the total weight to exceed the maximum amount allowed by 660 pounds (the sum of two passengers). \n\n### Maximum passenger Weight:\nThe sign explicitly states that the maximum weight of passengers is 660, not 600. It is not possible that the maximum weight of a single passenger is half of the maximum allowed weight for the entire elevator.

Choices:  'Alternate\u2019  'Often\u2019\nRationales: (1). What does'regular' means in the sense of'regularly'. That's important because we have three similar words to look at: 'alternate', 'frequent' and'regular'. (2). Looking at the context of the sentence indicates that'regular' here actually conveys the idea of doing something \"at least\" (or more) than once. (3). Based on the context and the use of'regular' as 'a least','regular' can be replaced with any one of 'alternate' or 'frequent'.\nA: \"alternate\" means to take turns or to change back and forth. This doesn't really have anything to do with how often you do something.

'The station' doesn't make much sense because the station was a place where cats and mice would definitely search for each other.\n\n\nB. The track seems like a better fit because it suggests looking for the mouse in a particular area, which would be a more logical choice than the house, box, or train. \nC. The house might have the mouse, but the question doesn't specify where the cat is looking. However, the mouse could be hiding in the train, box, or track.\nD. The box suggests that the mouse could be hiding inside, but it's possible the mouse may have come out while the cat was on the station.\nE. The train is a possible source for the mouse to hide on; but not the track or station, so the cat would continue on in search of the mouse without finding it.\n\nBased on evaluating the choices within the context of the full question, 'The track' is the answer choice best fit in context.

{"text": "There are 334 books in the library.\n\nThere are now 312 books in the library. \n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe statement gives us a starting number of books in the library. We can also assume that there are no new copies or new stories added, and we can use it to calculate the net change of how many books there are in the library. 124 books were taken out on Monday and 22 books were returned on Tuesday. This means that 102 books were lost on Monday and 20 books were gained on Tuesday. We have to find our net change by subtracting the number of gained books with number of lost books. 102 - 20 = 82. The final result is that there is a net change of 82 books in library on Monday, total books in library being 334 and after books taken out on Monday and books brought back on Tuesday, new books are left in library being 312.\n\nAnswer: 312 \n\n### Instructions:\nComplete the following math equation.\n\n### Response (A): 12 - 5 = 7\n\n### Rational:\nA has 8 beans and they add up to 30 beans.

The word total is a generic term that's used with other subjects and numbers to create the answer to a question where no other data is provided.\n2. Since the question asks for the total, and not the number of triangles or squares for example, 1 is the correct answer.\n\n3. But what about B?\n\n4. B suggests \"2\" which is correct, but can also be correct for C and D as the total of the triangles, squares, and hexagons is 9. 5. In this case, 9 is used for both B & C so 1 is the correct solution.\n\n6. E also suggests \"2\". If you take the total of the triangular ones, add it with triangles and you get 9. However, it is possible to have multiple triangles that are similar (i.e. the hexagon is similar to the triangular one), and thus the total is actually \"6\". The same can be said about triangles and squares - multiple ones can be similar, for example the two squares can be similar to triangles.\n7.

And finally, the equation in the response is correct; 10 + 10 + 3 = 43, not 40.\nThe response can be valid with either 43 or 40; the difference in the response is 3kg or 10%, which is a minor difference.\n\n### Guidance:\nIn the validation of a response above, a minor difference of 3kg (or 10% of the total) can be ignored.\n### The above responses show an understanding of the question and how the system computes scores.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "There are a total of 12 bricks in each row of the lower half, and a total of 8 bricks in each row on the top half, so there must be the same number of bricks in each row in each half. There are 4 rows in each half, so there are 4 x 4 = 16 bricks in the lower half, and 4 x 8 = 32 bricks in the top half, for a total of 16+32 = 48 bricks\n\n### Rationale:\nThe bottom half of the igloop has 12 brcks of snow in each row, which total to 48 bricks. Like wise, the top half of the dloo has 8 snow brcks in each row, which equal to 32 bricks. Combining these two rows, we can see that there is 48+32 = 80 bricks on the igloo.\n\n### Response 2: Libby could not possibly have used 80 bricks, but she could have used 16+30 = 46 bricks without being able to build the igloo. How about a total of 14?\n\nResponse 2: We know that bricks of snow are made using layers of snow, and that all the bricks that make up the bottom half are smaller (12 bricks) than the ones that make up the top half (8). To use a total of 19 bricks, Libby would need to use 48+18 = 66 bricks, or 8 rows of 8, which doesn't work.\n\n### Rationales:\nIf Libby were to use the number of bricks suggested in response two, she would need 66. This number could not be possible, as the question specifies that the total number of bricks she used were 10 less than 80. In order to use 80 bricks she will need to use 16 bricks across eight rows.

{"text": "Robin ate 8 cupcakes.\n\nInput: What do you do around the house? Choices: 1. play with toys 2. do homework 3. eat out 4. do the washing 5. watch tv\nRationales: In this section, we will look at five possible answers and make the right choice. The question is asking about what to do around your house. \nStep 1: '1. play with toy'. We don't know what the toy is. It is not specified whether the play is with toys or is the toy playing or is it for a baby to play with a toy.\nStep 2: '2. do homework'. No, this is not what you do around the house. Homework can be an activity for you to do at school or else outside. However this is not an activity that you'll do around your house.\nStep 3: '3. eat out'. The question states, 'around the house'. What you eat out is not necessarily something that you would do around your house. You can eat out for instance in a restaurant or you can prepare a meal at home or somewhere else. \nStep 4: '4. do the wash'. Again, 'do the wash' does not necessarily imply doing the wash around your house. What's more, it's not clear what type of wash Robin is referring to, be it clothes wash, food wash, hands wash - there are so many types of wash. Also the usage of capital 'D' adds more confusion so the question is not clear on what the wash she will do is.\nStep 5: '5. watch tv'. This is very ambiguous and may or may not be applicable to do around your house or not around your house. 1. You can watch TV at school or anywhere else out of your house except just inside your house.\n2. Not all TV shows are about things around your home. Most TV shows are about what happens outside your house.\n3. You can do anything like eating lunch or watching TV around your house anytime of day without doing it exactly at 12 noon, so the time does not match what Robin is doing or asking.\n4. The main part is \"watch tv\" but the second thing to be done in the question is \"around", "answer": " 12"}

We will work on the first key, and then on the second key, and so on upto 'n' number of key cleaning task.\n\nWe use the term 'd' to represent time taken to clean a single key and we keep it constant.\n\nSo, in first key, time taken is 'd' and after cleaning 'd' time is consumed, we see 14 keys which means time taken for 14 key cleaning time will be of (initial time + (d x n))\n\nWe know that initially time taken is 3 (initial time) and after cleaning time taken by 14 key will be of d x n. Now, 3 + d x n.\n\nNow, cleaning all the keys will take,\nT = (initial time + ( d x n))\n\nBut, we already know that, 'd' remains constant, so, we can write whole expression as:\nT =3 + ( d \u00d7 n )\n\nBut that is not the answer!\nSo, as we know that initial time taken by 15 keys is 3, the resultant time is:\nR =3 + (d \u00d7 n+15)\nD =3 + (d x n )\n\nWe know that,\n\nR = 3 + ( d \u00d7 (n + 15)) and D = 3 + (d (n+15))\n\nAs a solution, We apply the formula, for calculating the mean of two numbers.\n\nIn this case, (n+15=d+15+15).\n\nSo, we have:\n\nR = 2nd number / number of all numbers = ( 3 + ( d+15+14+13+\u2026..+2+1+0 )) / m = ( 3 + 55) / m\nD = 1st number / number of all the numbers = ( 3+15 -14+13 \u2026. 2+1+0) / m = (3+30-11+12) / m\n\nD = R\n\n### Explanation:\n\nTina's time was taken", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": "After next week, there will be 13 ceilings left to paint.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. First, let's break down the sentence, \"Michelangelo has...\" into multiple parts. We get \"Michelangelo\" which is the subject, which means who or what is doing the action.\n2. \"has\" is the verb part, indicating what is being done. In this example, we are finding some information about a number \u2014 in this case, ceiling, that Michelangelo has or owns.\n3. The last part is the \"preposition phrase\" that indicates where you can find the information related to the verb, \"has\". Here, the word \"to paint\" tells us where Michelangelo's ceilings are.\n4. We know there are 28 ceiligs. Michelangelo paints 12 ceilings this week, after which they are 16 remaining ceilings to paint next week. Michelangelo will paint 1/5 of these ceilings, so after that he will have 9 ceilings left to finish. This means that the total ceilings would be 12 original number + (1/5).\n5. In other words, to solve this question, you can take the total ceiings \u2014 \"28\" and subtract the 'total paintings/total painting weeks' to get the remaining ceilings.\n\n\nGreg has four bicycles. He repairs bicycles and sells them, so there are no more than four. This week he sold two and repaired five.

Let's assume they are from 6 to 11, as the previous 5 are. We'll also call this the last 9 slots. (11-6=5). In this first step, we will use only the last 9 slits i.e 6:00pm through 11:00:00pm. Let's say that slot #3 in this 'column' was used earlier and is taken off the table by 11 pm. Hence, the range of available slots is from slot #4 through 11:10:00 pm, because the last available slot for that day is also the first available slot for the next day (day 0).\n\nStep 2 -b: Now let's say the customer 'orders' the pizza after 11:15 pm, what time slot could they request? The answer is at 7:40 pm, which lies in the first available slot ('slot 4').\n\nStep 2c: Why 7:40? This is because all the customer has to be specific about are the two times they can NOT have the pizza delivered. The first time they state, is after (and including) 6 pm. As we saw in Step 2.b, this is already taken. The second time is also 6 pm, so we have to move on to looking at the 9th time slot available (which is after 7:10 pm).

Then, using the assumption of a complete repertoire, we know that there are 30 of them in total.\nFinally, there are 30 days in the week so we would divide the 7 songs that they played in their second set by the entire repertoire which is 7/30. Therefore, their answer is 56/30 songs in their second set, so 7 + 56/3 = 27 songs on average.\nSecondly, let us evaluate what will be the average of their third and fourth set.\nWe know that there will be 3 extra songs in their remaining sets. Therefore, since, by our assumption, they played their entire repertoire. We are able to conclude that the average of their third set would be 7 + 27 + 3 = 37/3 =27.67 and their fourth set would be on average 30/3 = 10/3 =3.33.\n\n### Solution:\n\nFirstly, let us examine how many songs was in their second, third, and fourth sets\nSince they didn't play through their entire reperatorio, we are able to say that there would be 7 songs in their sest, and 2 in their fourth set.

{"text": "Let`s analyze the expression \"Jimmy bought 2 notebooks\"\n- The phrase \"bought 2\" is in an absolute sentence which doesn`t specify the quantity of it, the correct phrase need to be \"bought two\". So, the expression \"bought 2 notebooks\", is an incorrect expression.\n\n### Response analysis:The second expression \"2 notebook\" contains the incorrect verb of \"notebooks\", since we already know that the quantity of \u201cnotebooks\u201d = 2, we just need to identify the verb of the quantity, in this case we can write the correct expression as \"2 notebooks\". And the last expression \"folders for $5 each\" in an error since it is not the typical way to writing the possessive adjective, that expression should be \"folders priced at $5 each\", the correct way to do it is that:\n\n- We know that \"2\" folders for $5 = $10, and the total cost is:\n- $10 + $1.5 = $11.5. Hence, the correct answer is \"bought 3 pens for $1 each, $10 in notebooks, and $11.5 in folders\",\n- We just replace the word \"each\" with \"each one\" and the phrase \"folders for $4 each\", and the correct expression will be \"folders prised at $5 each\".", "answer": " 25"}

A: Washing machine. It\u2019s not directly related to \u2018clothes\u2019. It could be used on \u2018clothes\u2019, but it is not typically used for \u2018clothes\u2019 directly.\n2. C: Stain remover. It is not directly related to \u2018getting ready\u2019, but indirectly it is because it is used to remove stains from the cloth. So, it is not a correct answer choice.\n3. B: Collar. Let\u2019s see if each option A, B, C, D, E, F is correct based on the given context. Option A may be incorrect because it is a very expensive clothing piece and not directly related to the question as it is related to \u2018cloth\u2019 only, and not clothes in a general sense. Option B cannot be right because we cannot use Collar on Washing Machine directly. Option C may be correct, but it\u2019s not sure for the given context.

{"text": "Mr. Callen lost $447. \n\nTo understand this task and the response, consider the following diagrams to compare to each other. \n\n 1. The top diagram shows the original price of 10 paintings costing $400.\n 2. On the right side, the paintings were sold and each painting cost $360 which is 10% less.\n 3. The total amount of paintings sold = $ 400 - (10%(400)) = $ 3600\n 4. So he earned $3600 by selling the paintings he bought for $400. However, after selling each of the 10 paintings, the total price of each painting is $360 and not $3600.\n 5. The bottom diagram shows the original price for the 8 wooden toys costing $ 160.\n 6. On the right side of the toy items, the toys were sold and each cost $132, which is 15% less than the initial price.\n 7. The total sale price = $ 160 - (15%(160)) = $ 1384\n 8. Once again, after selling each wooden toy, the total price for each wooden toy is $138. Since total sale price is 15% of $160, $160 - (0.15(160))\n 9. So Mr. Callen earned $1384 from selling the wooden toys he bought for $160. Since he ended up selling each item for a lesser price, he made a loss of $138. After the loss, the total money Mr. Callen made = $1384 - 138 = $ 1246. He lost $139.55 ($3600 - $2200)\n\n\nTo understand the response below, look at the following diagram. In the diagram, there are 8 wooden toys bought initially costing a dollar ($1.00). After selling them, the toys were valued at $0.76 (132 cents).\n\nThis is how the diagram", "answer": " 64"}

The statement 'Brad entered his pumpkin that weighed 54 pounds. Jessica's weighed half of Brad's. Betty's weighed 4 times her pumpkin weight.'\n#### Step6: Compare data from participants and the weight of the pumkin.

Choices:  A.1/13 B. 1/4 C. 1/3 D. 1 E. 3\nRationales: Tabitha is the total of all the candy.  \nWe put candy pieces in that amount. \nStep 1: A. The number 1 over one thirteenth is 1/13.\n\nStep 1 1/13 equals 8.462 (this is 1/10 of one eighth rounded to the closest multiple without rounding down or removing the decimal point.) If you take 1 minus 1 over 13 you get 11/13.  Let\u2019s say it is the denominator.  To get the numerator we need the other 11/12.  11 is a multiple of 7 and 12 is a multiple of 9.  Let\u2019s see what adding this 7 and 9 gives us.   \n7+9=16 16 is a multiple of 1,2,4,16.  We must divide by 1.  This gives us 16/1.  Our numerator of 16 divided by 1 is 16. \nSo \nStep 1 8.460695446151016 (this is 8.46 after 20 decimal places) which is 1/12 plus 8.46 (we rounded to the closest number without rounding down or without removing the decimal point.) is 1/11. \n\nStep 2 B. 1/13 x 2.6895507939362154 is the answer. \nC. 1/4 x 11.3183012931926663 = 1/4 (this because 215 divided by 4 is 53.88092508249991) so the answer is 215/4 or", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "I would say that the final third verse involves everyone singing, therefore there were 30 people in that choir. \n\n\n### Input\nI am studying Spanish. I have been studying Spanish for six years. I am in the third year of my Spanish degree. \n\n### Demostration\nFirst and second year is not related in any of the following ways:\nFollowing are two options to explain the phrase 'for six years':\n1. Years is an English idiom referring to the period of time, usually beginning from when a person was born to when that person dies.\n2. Following the same explanation for the phrase 'in the third year of my degree', the idiom 'in the third year' is referring to the third year from when the individual started their undergraduate studies.\n\nHence, both the phrases 'I am studying Spanish' and 'I have been studying Spanish for 6 years' refer to a period of time, not including the period when that person was still learning Spanish.\nThird year is not related in anyway to the phrase 'I have been studying in the third year of Spanish':\nThere are various ways to determine the years of an undergraduate degree. A 'third year student' does not, however, refer to an individual who is studying in the third year from when they started their undergraduate degree. For example, if a student entered Year 1 of their undergraduate degree in 2015, they would actually be completing Year 3 in 2018, not the third year of Spanish.\n\nThere are multiple factors that can affect the interpretation of an individual's academic program. If 'A third year' is considered as one of these factors then the phrase'studying in the third year of' can have a multiple meanings depending on the context. If 'year' is removed from consideration, then 'third year' has only one possible meaning, which is referring to a specific program, and not to an individual's academic progression, as in the sentence 'a third year student'.\n\nThus, to conclude, the phrase 'for six consecutive years' is an idiom, and is not related to 'year' in the phrase 'in the final year of our course' or 'in the third year'. The latter phrase does not state an academic progression. \n\n## Test 05\n### R", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "He spent two weeks of time jogging; each hour on average, the man jogged for two weeks. That's equivalent to about 28 days or 28 hours of time.\n\n### Rationale:\nIn the first sentence, the speaker gives information about the times of the day.\n\nFrom the second sentence, we can conclude that the speaker is using the verb \u201cspent\u201d in the context of \"spend\". In the use of an indefinite article with the verb \"spend\", the speaker is referring to time and cost of the action in the past. The pronoun \"after\" in the question, implies that the speaker is asking \u201cHow many hours did he spend jogging?\" after the two weeks from the start of question.\n\n## Question: Answer each question below.\n\n### Question:\nInput: Where might the book be kept? Choices: A. house B. box C. table D. cabinet E. bedroom\nRationales:\n\n1.  We can start by asking ourselves \"where might a book be kept?\u201d. If we refer to \"the book\" in this question, then we likely mean a book that belongs to us and is important to us. \n2.  With that context, we can infer that the book in question is likely in the house or in some common place or room in the home like the living room, where we can put or place things (like a table or cabinet) and where the book can be stored. This is likely similar to having a bookshelf at home which contains books of all types and some extra room for books and extra books that can be used later. \n3.  We will eliminate choices \"A: house\" and \"table\" because the question refers to a specific room in the house whereas those are generic (in B and D). \n4.  We can eliminate B. choice \"box\" because the book in \"A: house\" might well be a generic one, or belong to some other person and thus be somewhere out in the world, not at home with us. \n5.  We eliminate choice \" C: table\" and \"E: cabinet\" because both are generic places in a house or in a room within the house, not a specific room within the house. \n6.  Therefore, we can conclude that \"D: Bedroom\" is the most likely place that the book would be kept.", "answer": " 21"}

So, let's assume Ben has x dogs.\n3. The number of dogs Ben has is greater than Teddy's peters (ie x > 7), so Teddy has more pets than Ben (ie x < 7).\n4. Then, Dave doesn't have Tedd's pests either, but instead Dave has more cats. So, let't assume Dave has x more cats than Teddy's cats.\n5. The number of cats Dave has is greater than Tedd's cats (ie x > 8), so Dave has more pets than Teddy (ie x > 13).\n6. The total number of cats in Teddy's pesticide (ie 7) is equal to the total number of cats of Teddy plus the total number of dogs Teddy has (ie 5 + 8).\n7. The total number more cats are x + Teddy's catterpillage (ie 7 + 8). Then the sum of Teddy's pestle and x is equal to x + 13.\n8. Similarly, the total number of dogs Ben has (ie 9 and Teddy's dogs (ie 7) are equal to the number of Ben's dogs (ie x) plus Teddy's dogs. So, 9 + x is equal to Ben's number of dogs. Hence, the pesticide has total x pests between Teddy, Ben and Dave which doesn't exceed that they actually have in their possession.\n9. So, then, the total number of pets is the sum of Ben and Teddy (which is 32).\n10. Therefore, the correct the number of pets among Ben, Teddy and Dave is C: 34", "answer": " 54"}

This is not possible, as each minute costs $45.\nStep 4: Answer B is $44 per minute. Although not specified in the question, this is still incorrect because to use the information given, each minute should cost $42 ($5 + $ 30 * 60).\nStep 5: Answer D is $44 per hour. This is correct, because a bath is 30 minutes long, which will be given a dog, making it cost: $5 + $30 = $35, dividing by 60, therefore, 35/60 = $44 - $1 = $43 - $1 = $ 42.\nStep 6: Answer E is $54 per hour.

{"text": "To find out how many cups of milk Hannah should use, we need to start by making a mathematical model of the relationship between the bananas and flour and then use mathematical manipulation to solve our question. \n\nStep 1: Let us define these variables: Let us start off by defining the variables we are going to use in the mathematical model.\n\nLet us define these variables to show the mathematical model that we are going to create to solve this problem.\nWe know that we need to multiply 20 bananas by cups of banana mush to get the flour of banana mush needed, but we need to use a cup of banana mash for each cup of flour, so we need to multiply the cups of banana by cups of mash and divide by 3.\n\nLet us use \\(b \\rightarrow B\\) for bananas, \\(b_{mash} \\rightarrow B_{mash}\\) for banana mash, \\(b_{flour} \\rightarrow B_{flour }\\) for banana flour, \\(f \\rightarrow F\\) for flour and \\(m \\rightarrow M\\) for mash.\n\nStep 1.1: The flour for every banana mush is the inverse of the bananas that we are using multiplied by cups of mush.

Instructions 1-4 \nWe only need to use an additional step for this question.\n\n1. For each letter B-D, you can either use the statement or the diagram to help you remember the correct answer.\n2. Diagram: If you use a circle and the diameter of the circle is 'yesterday', the radius will be, for letter '1' - the 'number of pages' she read yesterday. This equals '12'. \n\n3. For letter '2', this would be the 'number of pages she read today' and this equals '2 times the yesterday'. This would be '24'.\n\n4. Using the same formula for letter '3', it is important to note that today's 'number of pages she can read' comes from yesterday's 'number of yesterdays'. So, today's number of pages = yesterday's number of pages x 2, which equals 24 x 2 = 48. \n\n5. For letter '4', this is the 'number of pages Julie wants to read'. This will have to be divided by the number of pages she will have when she finishes tomorrow. For letter '4' this means '(yesterday + today) pages'. That equals 120 + 48 pages = 168 pages. Therefore, for 'tomorrow', we take the remainder of the number of pages (168 pages - 'number of pages she wants to read' / 2 = 60 pages. \n\n6. For the formula of A = B+C+D, we now know that A = yesterdays, B = today's, C = tomorrows and D = number of pages Julie wants.  Letter B is equal to yesterday's 'number if pages' and this equals 12 pages. As 'today's number of pages' = 'yesterday's number of pages + today's number of page = '168 pages + 24 pages', we can put these two values into the formula A = B+C, A =", "answer": " 42"}

According to the Economist, Trade war is the act of a country placing high restrictions on another's exports (The Economist).\nStep 2 :How will a restriction of imports affect the economy? A good is a product you buy from other countries. When you trade, the money you pay for this product is called \"imports\" (Macroeconomics).\nStep 3 :How will an import tariff increase, or a tax, affect the economy? Imports are taxed based on the price you pay for it, to ensure the cost of import is close to the domestic price, this is called \"tax revenue \" (Macroeconomics)\nStep 4 : What is happening when a trade restriction happens? The amount of taxes imposed on imports will reduce exports of the country because they have to meet high costs to export, the economy tends to become unbalanced because there is too much of a good compared to the demand. \nTherefore, When two countries' economies hurt, this means that the countries are fighting each other. \nAnswer: Trade wars are when there are restrictions on imports and exports. Economies hurt because there are too many of a commodity and an unbalanced economy and the countries are fighting each others.\nAnswer: D\n\n### Input:(Tech and science writer,) \"In 2012, a Chinese scientist named He Jiankui claimed to have altered the human genome of twin girls, named Lulu and Nana.

{"text": "There are 48/1 gallon/inch fish formula in the first tank. In the second tank, for 48/2, we get 24 gallons/inch fish formula. Therefore, for three inches, we get 72 gallons formula. \n\n### Explanation:The total number of gallons in both tanks - 2 * 24 = 48. The second tank can have at most three inches fish. Since the formula for three inches is 48 / (3 * 3) = 24. So the maximum possible number of fish in second tank is 24. But the first tank has at least 48/1 formula, if every fish is two inches. Hence for three-inch fish, the fish-size formula for first tank will be 28. In other words, the fish-size rule of one gallon per inch of fish is not fulfilled since there is a fish that needs at least 4 gallons of water. As a result, the fish of first tank would eat and eat other fish since they consume at least 4 gallon. The first tank fish would consume at least 14 gallons more than average so their total would be larger than the other 24 fish tank.\nAnswer: 14\n\n### Input:# Input: What type of material is more difficult to stretch than rubber but can be stretched thinner than cotton?

She then worked for 18 minutes after lunch, so she should have written one sentence more for a total of 121. She then typed 15 minutes more, resulting in another 90 sentences.

{"text": "One possible solution is to subtract the number of surface goldfish from the given number, to arrive at the number of goldfish below the surface. However, this solution may not work because some of the surface goldfish might also be below the surface. To avoid this scenario, a better solution is to count the goldfish below the surface separately.\n\nIf we start with the assumption that the goldfish under and above the surface were divided evenly, we can create two equations to solve for the number of goldfish under and above:\n\nn is the number of goldfish in the pond and x is the number of gold fish below.\n\nNow, we can substitute x with an unknown value, n(0.75) - x = 15, and solve for x.\n\nNow we can simplify x, which is 15(0.25) = 3.75.\n\nThe correct answer is \"3\".\n\nAnswer: 3\n\n### Input : In 1993, Microsoft introduced the Internet.

{"text": "There will be 300 birds left in the poulty\nAnswer:\n\n### Explanation:\nStep 1: The question describes a situation where a farm has a poultry farm and a disease kills most of the chickens, turkeys and guinea fowls that inhabit it. This clearly indicates a decrease in the number of birds over time.\nStep 2: The question goes on to say that 20 chickers, 8 turkeys, and 5 guinea will die every day. This adds more details on the amount by which the number of birds will decrease each day.\nStep 3: To solve the given problem, begin by identifying the initial state of the poultry farm with its population: 300 chicks, 200 birds, 80 guinea.\nStep 4: Begining with 4 additional pieces of data given in the problem, make conclusions to solve the problem. The first data is that \"every day the farmer lost _____ birds\". Next we have that an equal amount of chicken, turkey, and guinea fowl birds are lost each day. Finally, we know that 20 chicken, 8 turkey, and 5 guineas are going to be dead at the end of a week. The data clearly indicate that we need to use a linear equation as a model for the relationship between time, days, and the number of birds.\nStep 5: Develop a linear equation that connects time, days, and number of birds and solves the problem. The linear equation can be formulated like this: y=mx+b, where y = number of birds left, m = linear value for the model, and b = linear value. As the problem is about a week, then the days are 7. To solve for m, since y = x= number of birds left, if b will be the initial amount of birds, it will mean that everyday a farmer will lose 50% of chicken, turkeys and guineas. This is equivalent to m= -0.5. Then b=300 - (-0.5 * 7)\nStep 6: Solve the equation to find the amount of birds left. It's y=(3/2)*x+675. If you plug in the values, you'll find the", "answer": " 349"}

When given with the word \"old\" the answer is 16. \n\n### Input : How long does it take to get to Earth from Mars?\n\n### Rationales:\nFirst, understand the task at hand: the task is to find out whether it takes longer to go from Mars to earth, to earth to Mars or Mars to Mars.\nSecond, read and analyse each of the given choices.\n\nConsidering choice A, 'around 20 minutes'. First, note that the question is asking for the duration between the two planets, not the duration of the trips.\nSecond, 'around' is a vague term. You might say 'I'm around 35 years old' but that doesn't necessarily mean you're exactly 35 years old.\nThird, you do not know how the age is measured. There is no context that gives any relevant information, so in this context, age can be measured in years, minutes and seconds, among other units.\nIf it were minutes or hours, 20 would be a better choice than \"around 20\".\nIf it were years, then \"around 200\" is better than \"around 23 years\".\n\nFor choice B, 'half the time it takes to get from earth to Mars'. The context doesn't suggest time as a variable. The context suggests travel to and from the planet Mars.\n\nSo, as an option, let's pick choice C: 'it takes' then it would still make sense for the answer to be between 19-20 minutes.\nAnd if we say 'it takes' for choice D, it would still make sense it's between 20-30 minutes.\n\n### Inputs:\n\nInputs: \"This was a nice place to visit.\" \n\nStep 1) Decide if the word choice is required.\n\nNo, no word choice is required.", "answer": " 18"}

How many times does an even number go into an even number? Choices: 1)1 2)0 \n3)2 4)infinity\nRationales:\n1. The phrase 'How many times does an even...' provides a clue that an even number must have a remainder when divided by two and hence an even number can only be a multiple of two.\n2. The choices all make sense.\n3. 1 says that it is once. This implies that the answer is 1 only. \n4. 2 says that it is twice.

The word 'ratio' in this question, suggests that it should relate two values, therefore the answer should indicate the ratio between the legs and the thighs. \n2. The choice of '35' clearly denotes 2 legs and 3 thighs and thereby it is ruled out. Similarly, the choice of '15' denotes only 2 legs and 2 thighs and in turn is ruled out. It is '70' and in turn it is correct. \n3. The choice of '70' denotes that the number of legs equals the number of thighs and in this case is 5. \n4.

{"text": "Rationales:\n1. The question states the dog's adult weight as its full adult weight. When working on a mathematical problem, especially in exams, the word total or fully is often used to define the entirety of something which doesn't leave much room for ambiguity. By working backwards, we can safely conclude that the question's full adult weight is 160 pounds because a year is also 52 weeks and therefore the dog's full weight would need to reach an additional 30 pounds by week 52. \n2. When working on algebra questions, solving for the missing variable(s) is often a necessary step. In algebra, for instance, equation solvers frequently rely on variables with the letter 'x' and an unknown number, which we can label with the letter 'Y' or 'y'. \n3. By considering the wording of the question, it appears that a dog can reach its final adult weight at one year. \n4. From the chart above, we see that the dog's weight doubles when it is only 11 weeks old, then doubles when it is 16 weeks old. \n5. Therefore, the dog needs to gain only 74 pounds from week 17 to its full adult weight of 160 pounds by reaching an adult weight at the age of one. \n6. Solving for Y can be done through backsolving, where working backwards from an answer will help in determining the correct question.  To solve for Y, we need to double 80 and subtract 160 from it. This gives us an answer of 140 as the dog's final adult weight. \n7. The answer is then 140.\nAnswer:140.", "answer": " 78"}
{"text": "20 hours. \n\n### Reason: Let's assume that Kenny took a walk each day for 1 hour. Kenny's entire total time devoted to music was 10 + 2(10) = 25 hours. He took 2 walks per day, which means he could dedicate exactly 5 hours on music. So, Kenny took 16+5= 21 hours on music. Subtracting what he took on music from what he took on walks - 25-21=4 hours. And, since he took twice that to music, his total devotion to music was 8 hours; that means he must have devote 4 times that much time to walking and we also know that he must have practiced on the trumps for 2 times that and we know he played basketball for 10 hours. And, the final answer will 8 + 4 = 12 hours and 12 + 2 = 14 hours of musical devotion and 14 + 4 = 20 hours of walking. \nAnswer: 20 hours\n\n### Input\n\nYou are given the following numbered clues.

Each pineapple ring can be sold for 5$ so the profit of one pineapple is (5 - 23/3) $ and the total profit is 5 \u22c5 (5 - 523/3)/5 = 2.64.\n\n### Reason:The key to solve this question is recognising that each pineapple ring was cut from one pineapple, so the pineapple rings come in 12s. Thus, we find the profit of each pineapple: (5 - 263/3)/5. \nNext, we use the multiplication property to multiply by the number of pineapple rings (12), to get the profit of Jonah\u2019s pineapples: ______. \n\n# Additional Suggested Resource\n1.

{"text": "To answer this question, we must first gather data on Annie's chauffeur and road conditions for every degree temperature dropped below 32 degrees. We have 2 different types of information. Since information about Annie's safe chauffeur is known, data on that information is gathered and can be used to compute her safe chauffeur. However, 2 conditions: the percentage increase of Annie's safe driving chauffeur with every 3 degrees the temp dropped below 32 and the percentage probability of Annie getting into serious accident if her safe driving chauffeur decreased. This is possible by dividing these two data sets accordingly, 1. Compute Annie's safe driver with a fixed amount of decrease in safe drivers. 2. Compute the percent chance for Annie getting into serious accidents with Annie's fixed safe driver, but with different decreases in temperatures. To begin, we use the following equation to compute Annie's safe drivers. We found that one safe driver will decrease after every 3 decreases. \n\n$$SafeDriver = 0.4/(0.04*3) * Temp$$\n\nThus, if every 3 decreases in temperature in decreased to 80 degrees, Annie' re safe drivers is.75. However, what would happen if her safe driver decreased even further? Well, we can do some calculations and get the following values. Every 3 degree decreases, 1 safe driver will disappear. Thus, if Annie's vehicle reaches 26 degrees, her vehicle will have 3 safe drivers. It will be at 4 degrees, she will have one safe driver. Thus, her safe driver, in the worst case scenario, could be.075 (.925 *.04). By computing this safe driver, we could then use data on the percentage decreases of chance for Annie getting in serious accidents. \n\n$$SeriousAccident = 1 - C(5%*(40%)^N)(40%)^N * (1.4)^N $$\n\nHowever, this equation does not apply when there is an increase or decrease in the variable for the temperature, such as the one in the question.

If she carries a 60-lb backpack she walooks approximately 3 miles per hour (assume: she can carry only 20 lbs). \nIf she had not carried a 60-lbs backpack she would have covered in all 24-miles/3 * 8 hours (24/3-24/8). \nSo her walking pace would be 8/3 for 60 /8 = 8 * 60 / 8 = 10-mi/h. \nHence, Arlene's hiking pace is 4 miles per hour.\n\n### Rationale:\nLooking at the problem at hand, Arlene had walked (assuming) a total of 24-miliers, so she walked at a speed (x) which is equal to 24/x. Then the question comes in to finding the exact x such that 24/x is equal to 8 and thus we can find x by rearranging the above. Thus, 24/x =8, so x = 24/8 =4. Here we have to substitute x with 4 in the original context.

This answer also tells you that Jeff spends three times the number of hours catching up with his friends as he does working. 8 is 3 times larger than 2, so Jeff spends 8 hours working and 24 (3 times) hours catching up.

This helps us narrow down to answers that make sense with that context.\n\nStep 1: Consider each answer option in the context of the question.\n\nStep 01: Answer A: A train is a way people would go to work in the present. This doesn't really make sense for how people would go to work from the past. Also, the first answer is A, not B.\n\nStep \uff102: Answer B: A horse is very old. Horses and other animal-drawn carts aren't really how people would go to their jobs in the past, or present.\n\nStep \u2162: Answer C: Cars are from the past and present. While cars may have been used for work in the past, they would definitely not have been used to go to work.\n\nStep IV: Answer D: Foot is a very old way to go to work. While people did and still do walk to work, this doesn't make sense for how people in the past would go to work.\nStep 5: Therefore, the best answer is C: car.

{"text": "The answer is D.  The chance of succeeding in both lawsuits is (1/2) x (1/2) as Andy has a 50/50 chance of defeating either of the two lawsuits that come next. But Andy also has a 30/70 chance that either lawsuit will end in failure. Sum these two events, and he has a 45/55 chance (or 2.050) of losing either lawsuit. The chance of loss is greater than the chance of victory, so the difference is that Andy's chance of winning is greater than his chance of losing.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe chance of succeeding in either of the second lawsuits is [1/2](or 50%), but there is also a 30% probability of \"losing\" first lawsuit. And there is a 50% probability of \"winning\" the first lawsuit. Thus, the total possible outcomes are:\n\n[1/2]x[1/2] (or 0,5000000)\n[1/2](or.5)x[0,5](or.25)\n[1/4](or.250000)x[0,25](or.125000)\n0,5 x 0 = 0\n0 x 0,25\n\nBecause winning both lawsuits together have less chance of winning, the chance is lower than losing both of them.\nThe same goes when the winning chances is multiplied by winning the first lawsuit.\n\n### Alternative answer\nAndy's chance of winning two trials is, as stated, [50/100](or 1). But Andy also has a [30/70](or.42857) chance that either trial will end in failure,\nSumming these two events, he has a 4285,71% chance of losing either lawsuit, and a 571,4% probability of winning both lawsuits.

For this we need to find out the number who went on rafting but didn't on tubing and the number who went on tubing but didn't go on rafting. \nThe total number of kids who actually went on the excursion is 20. That's half (20) of 40.\nThe number who did tubing but did not tube is 15+15=30. That's 1 less than 40.\n\nSo the total number of kids is 40-30=10. That means half of them (10) went on tubing but not rafting an half of them went on rafting and not on tubing. \nTherefore, the number of kids on the rafting who also went on tubing is 10.\n\n### Rationals: Step 1: The question clearly states the number of kids is given by 40%. Let us first find out the two options that make 40% as each option is divided in to two parts. We have A: 10% and B: 30%. \nStep 2: We first find out half of the % of both the options.\n\nStep 1: As percentage sign does not change when multiplied by two we can directly multiple a % with 2. Hence the half of % of \"40%\" is \"20%. Now we can easily calculate the fraction of the %s of the options B&A. We can do so based on the condition given in the question, that only \"half\" of the kids did tubing or went on the raft. Hence half of 10% is 1/2 of 10% which is 5% or 0.05*20 = 10. Similarly half of 30% is 15% or 0 3/4*20 = 30%.\n\nStep 3 : Now we need to divide 20 with each of the options to find out the number.

But if the station is also \"on the way\" then it's not correct, as a destination station will be also \"on the way\".\n- The third answer is \"on the street\". This doesn't specify where, and \"on the way to the station\" might be equally valid.\n- The fourth answer is \"in the town\". This doesn't really address the question of \"picking up\" or \"dropping off\". This also suggests a general location, rather than a specific point.\n- Therefore, the correct answer should be the fourth choice, \"in the town\".\n- Explaination:\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### You run a hotel", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "The fruit in each of the three buckets can be represented as a three-number sequence, with bucket A storing the number 1, bucket B storing the number 3, and bucket C storing the number 9. Thus, we can represent the sequence in terms of the missing numbers:\n\nFor example, if the missing number was 6, then we know that A's sequence would be 4, B's sequence would be [2, 3] and C's sequence would be ([1, 9] + 6). Thus, bucket A has three apples and bucket B has five apples.\n\nWe can use this method to determine how many pieces of fruit each bucket contains, and the total amount in all three buckets. \n\n### Demondation:\nFor all of the bucket problems, the three main sequences to determine the number are bucket A's sequence, bucket B's sequence, and bucket C's sequence. For the given problem, we see that bucket C has nine (9) pieces of fruit, so we can simply subtract 9 from each of the other two sequences to determine the number, and determine the total value of all the fruit. \n\n## Example 2\n\n### Instructions:  Complete the paragraph.\nThe _______ that is visible on the surface of Mars may be altered by wind, sand, and changing temperatures.\n\nA. terrain B. weather C. climate\n\nThe answer is a climate (specifically, the climate in question would be called the Martian climate).\n\n### Example 3\n\n### Instrctions: Fill in the blank with one of the words above.\nI enjoy living close to the ocean, mostly because of the climate.\n\n### Example4\n\n### Instuctions: Fill in to blanks with one of vocabulary words given above.\nHe lives in a warm climate, and enjoys working outdoors.\n\n### Solution\n\nThe answer is A: climate since the person living close to the ocean enjoys the climate.\n\nAs an extension question, students can be asked to describe what a climate in some other part of the country would be like.

{"text": "The least amount of money the elementary school teacher can spend on the Halloween goodie bag for her students if she buys only the theme the students requested is $123.\n\n### Explain:\n\nThe total amount spent on the bags is the product of 25 and $11 (the number of vampire bags to be bought at a cost of $11 each).\n\nTotal cost = $250 + $140 = $390.\n\nThe amount the teacher can spend on each student's theme if she buys everything is the product of the number of students and $87.50 (or 25 * $35 + $14).\n\nTotal cost for the vampire theme (25 * $3) = $75 + $14 = $89. Total cost for the pumpkin theme (14 * $3) = 42. Total cost = $157.50 + $89 + $76.50 = $323.\n\nThe total amount the elementary school teacher can actually spend on the Halloweenth goodie bags for the class is $323 - $157. Therefore, the teacher can spend $166.50 on bags. Divide by $25 to find $6.72 is the cost of a bag.\n\nSo, $87.5 + $6.72 = $94.22 is the least amount of bags that can cost the school teacher $123.72 at the store she chose to shop at for the Halloween goodies for her students.\n\n### Output:\n\nThe total cost for the vampires theme is $75.  The total cost for the pumpkins theme is $42.  The total cost is $157. 50.  The cost at the store is $123, making $166.60 for a total of 82.22 bags at a cost of $82.", "answer": " 17"}

Option A: University. While universities can charge tuition fees or living expenses that could be construed as expensive, it\u2019s not necessary to use a university as the context of the question is asking where the knowledge is typically gained before the phrase is attached, meaning a university couldn\u2019t be associated with the cost of gaining knowledge.\n2. Option B: Book. A book may be expensive in physical terms, but books can also be found for free or inexpensive from libraries. The phrase is also more likely used with the context of university, which makes B incorrect.\n3. Option C: Field. While the phrase could be attributed to farming or agriculture, the context of the question suggests a place where the knowledge is typically obtained before the phrase is attached. This leads us to eliminate D and E, as C fits better.\n4. Option D: Meeting. While a meeting with a teacher could be expensive, the phrase is more likely referring to a formal or scheduled gathering.

If we assume Lavinia\u2019s and Katie\u2019s son are 21 (for simplicity\u2019s sake) that works out to be 32 since 2 times 12 equals 24. If Lavinia\u2019s age is 52 which means that her son has to be 22 years old. It will also work if Katie\u2019s daughter turns 13 years old. Now that we know the ages of the members we can figure out how much older Lavinia\u2019s child is: (Son - daughter) = 22 - 12 = 10 years of age and her daughter is 12. If we consider Katie\u2019s age 52, Lavinia\u2019s could make sense at 64. Finally, Katie\u2019s daughter would be 13 since Katie\u2019s age makes the numbers work.\n\nSince Lavinia\u2019s birthday falls in 1997, the ages have been rounded down and the daughter (not daughter\u2019s age) would be 12.

{"text": "If he has 3 times the amount (A) he has on the 20th day, he just added 3 times the previous amount. Hence after 20 days, the previous amount would have been 3 times that of A. That's a very easy formula to solve and I'll skip straight to the answer and rationale.\n\n### Answer: Counter-example: Imagine if Johnny had 100 practice hours, then at some point he has 133 practice hours. 3 x 100 = 300, but if he has 130 practice hours this would mean he would need roughly 21 days to get 300 (and to get 3 times the amount he practices now). \n\nA few important points:\n\n1. Practice can\u2019t go to negative since we subtract from A (20 days ago).\n2. Johnny can't go past practice.\n3. Johnny currently has at least 15 practice. \n4. This also shows we can't get A by subtracting practice.\n\n### Rationale: The formula is quite simple. A = 3 x A.  So if we solve for A in terms of x, we would get, for each day x has passed: A = 3 (x+1).\n\n### If we start with A = 15 and x = 20, then we get A = 148.5. This can be rounded to A = 149.\n\nA few important notes:\n1. This shows we have not surpassed practice.\n2. We are getting close...\n3. I'm pretty confident that the answer is a \"day less than 21.\"\n\n### Response 2 (more correct response):If he has 3 times as little practice by day 20, the previous amount was (3 times) half that amount. That would mean Johnny has (3 times) 2 practice in the given time (for a total of 6 practice). If Johnny had 6 practice, then on day 4 (from when he has 15 practice), Johnny would have 9 practice (3 practice of 6 given).\n\n### Rationales: If A = 15, then this shows A (practice) is positive, and we have to find", "answer": " 80"}

Which of the three main functions performed by a verb in a sentence?\n\n### Demostration:\n2. Which is a noun?\n\n3. Which part of speech tells you about a person, place, or thing?\n\n4. Which part of speech shows the action being performed by the subject? \n\n##### Explanation:\n\nWe should know that a predicate is a word or group of words that comes after a subject and completes the statement. In other words, it tells us \"something about the subject.\"\nPredicate = subject + predicate\n\nA subject is the actor. Every subject has a predicate, which tells us something about the subject.\nIn the sentence, \"It is raining,\" \"it\" is the subject. Rain is the predicate.\n\nIn the sentence, _\"_ My friend wants a ride, and I am driving her,\" _\"My friend\" is the subject and \"wanting a ride\" is the predicate.\nMy friend = Subject\nwants a ride = Predicate\n\nThe predicate doesn't give any information about what the subject is like. We can't say whether a rain cloud is blue or purple; those are descriptive and give us more information about the rain. This kind of information is called the subject complement.\nThe predicate should _not_ tell us anything about the subject, like its gender, age, physical properties, or emotional state. The predicate completes the main clause.\n\nThe predicate does give us information about that subject, but this kind of information is not essential to understanding the subject's actions.\nThis predicate information describes the action, but it doesn't tell us who is doing it or why.\n\nThe subject verb: it is raining\nThe predicate verb: am driving her", "answer": " 54"}

The Question tells us that Susan bought two kinds of food from the market.\n2. From the questions statement, we can't understand which one is expensive than which one.\n3. Also we can't assume that the two kinds of food bought by Susan contains the same amount of food.\n4. The question contains the sentence \"what's the total cost of the food she bought?\".\n5. The number after she bought is six.\n6. The total cost contains two apples, two bannanas, 6 tomatoes and three potatoes.\n7. The total cost is 15 dollars.\n8.

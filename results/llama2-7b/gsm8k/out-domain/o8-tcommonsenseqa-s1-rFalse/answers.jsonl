{"text": "#### Steps:\n1. Divide the remaining amount that Lindsay eats of the mangoes, the unknown x, by 1.5. This is because 3/5 is 0.6, and 0.6 divided by 1 equals 0.6. To make it easier to plug in, we will round 0.6 up to 1. Also, we can simplify our division by dividing 0.6/1 by 0.6/2 and getting 0.33. We will divide 0.33 by 2 again and get 0.167.\n```\n\n2. Multiply 0.16 by 0.6 into the new variable called y that we will find the number of ripe mangos if there were 0.6 of a mango that was eaten by Lindsay.\n\n3. Add 400 to the new variable y, which is equal to the original value of 400 (400 mango trees) plus 3/5 of the mangos that were on the tree, which equals 400 x 0.3.\n\n4. The final answer is found by dividing the mangos that were left on the tree by one less than one half of the mangos that Lindsey ate, which is 0.16. You only want to do divisions after adding one to any number. Otherwise you will get imaginary numbers.\n```\n\nThe final answer to the problem is (400 x 3/5) - y = x, where the final answer after rearranging the equation to isolate y is 500.\n\n#### Output:\n500 - y - (60 x 0.5) - (400 x (3/5)) = x\n\n```\n\nAnswer: You have an integer in your string; it needs to be a float\n\n\\begin{code}\na = \" 2.5\" # or whatever your float will be\nb = 2.5\na_out = str(a) # get string\na_float = float(a_out)\nb_out = str(b) # get string\nb_float = float(b_out)\n\nanswer = b_float / a_float\n\nprint(answer", "answer": " 96"}

I did this so that it would be easier to check if one of the two constants was `True`. By using the `if` statement, I simply used the `row_capacity` method to determine if `row_capacity == 20`. In this situation, my `if` statement is `True`, so I used the `if` statement.\n\nHowever, the above method doesn't actually calculate the number of people, I had to add a `for` loop that iterates over the first element of the `tuple`. That's because I used `tuple` instead of `list`.\n\nThen, I simply put the `1` in the `x` position in the first row where `chair_capacity == true`. Then, I used `.all()` to determine if each position `x` has to be `True`.

{"text": "105kg\n\n### Justification: Input:A boxer starts a diet that allows for the loss of 3 pounds per month. This diet will result in a loss of 3 pounds each month. The last fight that the boxer will weigh was 97 kg as his weight at 4 months from the fight. The boxer's first fight will be the day he ends the diet.  Input: A boxer weighs in at 97kg before the fight. Each day the boxer eats less will result in a net loss of 3kg after each day of not eating. When each diet day ends, the boxer will go back to his normal eating habits which gives him back the 3kg gain he received that day. Each gain/loss will be made up by eating habits. Input: The boxers last known weight was at 97kg.  Since the time between the boxers last weigh in and the fight is 4 months, the boxers diet will go for 4 months until the fight. During that 4 month diet the boxer will only lose 3kg per month, which adds up to a total loss of 12kg during the 4 month diet. If the boxers total weight in kilograms is 97kg, this means that he eats over 87kg per diet day. He must lose 4kg a week for the diet to be finished 4 days before the fight.  Input: A total of 14 days exist between the diet starting and the weight of the boxer at the end of the fight. He will lose 3kg per day, which will result in a weight drop of 12kg over 4 months. If 3kg per day is lost, this means that 21kg will be lost per diet day. The boxer starts the fight at 97 kg, and ends at 76 kg. Input: The days between the first month and the last month are 30 days. Each month that passes the boxer's weight decreases by 12kg.  Input: Because there is a decrease in weight by 12kg each day, there are an extra 48kg gained over the course of the 4 months. This gives the boxer more weight than is lost, meaning that", "answer": " 85"}

{"text": "825 kids there in camp\n\n#### Explain Your Answer:\nWe can use the equation 2(3/4n) + (3x/4) then add 750 - 4x and simplify.\nThen we solve the equation for x. \n2(3/4x) =(3x) + 750 - x\nThen, we substitute 4x in for x. So the final equation is \n2(3)(3x) = 750 -4x\nThen, we distribute the 4 and simplify. It comes out to 960 - 3x and simplify.\nWe have 2(3x) = 960 -x\nNext, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2. It comes out to (3x) = 1920 - 2x\nNow, we can replace the 3x with the expression 3x for x. This makes the equation 3x = 192 -2x\nTo solve the equation for x, we subtract 2x. This will make it 3x= 192\nWe simplify and get 3x = 64. \nSubtract 64 from both sides of the equation and get -64 =3x. We simplify and get -64 + 64 = 3x + 64. 3x = 208. Then we solve the equation for 3x and get 3x/x - (208) / 3x = 48\nThis is simplifed to -48/x =208/3x and solve it for x.\n-48/x = (208)/3\nwe divide everything by 3\nThen x = 48 \n\n![](pic\\Screen Shot 2019-05-29 at 11.47.46 AM.png)\n\n#### Your Final Product(Optional):\n\n![](pic/Screenshot from 2019_05_29 11_49_54.png)", "answer": " 2000"}

{"text": "Eugene uses approximately 4,242 toothpicks to build his model house.\n\n### Notes:\n##### Answer in steps\n1)  First let x = the number of cards used.\n2)  Then let z = 450.\n3)  Since z is known, z is subtracted from x.\n4)  Thus, the first card used is 51, so the sum z, plus x= 52.\n5)  The same process as above is taken a second time, so now we know that after the 51st card, 74 more would be 95.\n6)  Now that we have gotten into the 2nd 52nd card, we know that the sum of x+z= 105.\n7)  Therefore, x = 105-z = 105\u2212450 = 346 toothpicks.\n8)  This process is continued and since there are 16 cards left that are not used, there would be 16x = 1944, so 1944+z = 1949.  The last 52 cards are x = 1426, so 1469-1944= 525.  This means that all those toothpicks used in the deck would be 525.\n9)  Now z = 452.

{"text": "The total earnings that Uki receives for five days is $568. She makes an average of sixty eight dollars for each day and bakes an average of sixty five cupcakes, five hundred and fifty cookies, and 1000 biscuits. The total earnings is then calculated by multiplying the amount of biscuits by the cost of a packet. The total cost is calculated as follows 65*1=65 biscuits 550*2=1100 biscuits and lastly she would multiply $1100*1000=1,100,000 cupcakes. The cost of a bundle of 1000 cookies that it takes her 1000 days to make is 1000*2=2000 and the total cost of 100 packets of cookie is 2000*4/100=8000.

{"text": "Bryan works each day for eight hours. Each day he spends three hours, or 0.75 of those eight hours, on marketing posts. He works each day for four hours on advertisement posts and spends half of the advertisement time on those posts each day. He has four hours each day to spend on advertisement posts, so he works each day for two out of the four hours on marketing posts. It would be four hours minus two hours, because he works two hours each day on marketing posts. That means he spends six hours on marketing posts during the day.\n\n### Explanation: \nThere are a few components to this question. In this data set, Bryan works for a certain client and works eight hours a day on their business. He also spends part of those eight hours on marketing posts, advertising posts, and customer out reach posts. The first sentence makes clear that he works one day each week on this specific client's business. The specific client tells Bryan to spend four hours a day each week on marketing posts. They also tell him that he can spend 0.5 of his eight-hour time slot on advertising posts each day. The next line gives you the number of hours Bryan works for each week. It will be important to use these hours as you come back to this next to last sentence in calculating the amount of time he spends on advertising posts. The question ends with an inquiry into how much time he spends on marketing posts each day. \n\nGiven the information in the sentence, you can use the formula n/8. The n in the formula represents the number of hours he or she works. That being the case, if he works eight hours each day, n would equal 64. The 8 in the formula was calculated to multiply by four and find the amount of hours they work for client. That being the case 0.5 times 8 would be eight hours. \n\nHere is what the formula tells us: if he works eight hours, and he spends four hours working on advertising posts, and four hours on marketing messages, you multiply eight by four, or 32, and you multiply that number by half, or 16 so that is 51.2 hours that he spends on market efforts (advertising and marketing). He does not spend 51", "answer": " 2"}

Therefore there are always an odd number of consecutive\n       elements.\n\nFor n = (n-1)/2 -1, because 2^n is always even, all 2^n subset are always consecutive.\n\nFor all other values of n, we have a unique solution. You could try solving the same question for n-3\n  elements, or for 3 elements in a 5 element set.\n\n### Solution\n\nThis problem is the same as the one given except the numbers are sorted in descending order, so the second\n  last element is an even number. It should be noted that there could be a number of algorithms you could\n  use to solve this particular question. They could range from simple nested for loops to sorting algorithms.\n\nWe can first sort the array, and then run a loop starting at the first element, and checking if there is a\nprevious even element, and if there is not, add another element to the set.\n\n```javascript\nfunction evenOddLength(n) {\n    n.sort();\n    let counter = 0;\n\n    // if there is only an even number of items, return true\n    if (n.length % 2 === 0) return true;\n\n    for (let i = 0; i < n.length; i++) {\n        // if the previous element is odd, set the odd flag on the current element\n        if (n[i - 1] % 2 === 1) n[i].even = false;\n        //", "answer": " 80"}

Use `20` for addition in this example.\n\n### Examples:\n\nNote: Example inputs and outputs are for demonstration and educational purposes only; your test will be similar but will not contain any example inputs.\n\nInput: `Add 20 to my age`\nOutput: `40`\n\nOutput: `22 + 5 = 27`\n\n### Demands:\n\n`Add to` is a function which takes `my age` as an argument, adds 20 to it, and gives the result as an output.\n\n`Add to my age` is a function which executes the command. Use `Add to my age` to execute the command.\n\n### Inputs and Outputs:\n\nInputs can be in the form of integers.\n\nThe result of an operation is the output.\n\n### Functions:\n\n`Add` takes two integers and gives the result as its output.\n\n## Explanation:\n\n## Inputs and Outputs\n\nWe can start from the end of the command and see what happens. We have an input `20` and an output `26`. Subtract 6 from 26 and we know we had a 20 added to 6. We also know we need to subtract 6 from 20.\n\n### Note\n\nSince one command can only contain one line (ie. one command) we can't write `Add 20 - 6` which would show us an error. We can, however, write `Get age - 6` which also has the intent of taking an age and subtracting 6 from it.", "answer": " 19"}

{"text": "John should buy 400 reams of paper if a ream contains  500 sheets.  \nEach month there are 12 sheets on each page.  There are 3000 sheets in a month.  2000 is how many pages can fit on reams of paper.  12 months is equals to how many reams of papers?  800 reams of papers. So over 12 weeks, John should buy 4800 reams.  He needs 400 for each month.  He should buy 10 more extra in the next year.\n\n### Example:John writes 4 stories every week.  The novel he writes every year is still 1200 (reminder: 1200pages a year for the novel).   Each sheet of paper can only hold 1 page.  If he only has 166 pages worth of paper, would he run out this year?   Yes, he would run out of paper if he ran out of paper on days that he writes his short stories.

So he needs 1087.5 sheets each month.  1660 is not close to his requirement.   It is a total of 962.5 sheets.  So he needs to buy 13 reams of paper for every month there are for short stories.

{"text": "Jack has $24.80 remaining to spend\n### Explanation:\nJack started with $100, and he bought four bottles of water, each of those bottles costing $2. After buying four bottles of water he had $64 remaining. Then, he spoke to his mother, who told him to buy twice as much, but he did not. Instead, he bought two bottles, and the two bottles cost him $4. So, Jack now only has $60 remaining, which is half of what he started with, because he bought twice as much. Then, he bought cheese, and the process that he just experienced was used with the same numbers. For example, one pound of cheese cost $10, so he knew to buy twice as much because he bought a pound, but then he bought half a pound, so he bought half of that half pound. It was two pounds, just like he bought two bottles of water.

If she has ${4\\over440}$, then she has less than 16 of the total number of cints she started with.  We will find the total number of cunits she has remained with.  We do that by multiplying the amount left by the number left remaining. We have ${391\\div 3} {440\\over 440}  {391\\over 441} = 51.1470 which is rounded to 51.

{"text": "The Italian restaurant earns $1122 by the end of the first week. \n\n### Justification:\nFirst, let's assume the average weekday (30 days divided by 5) is $1080. Then, multiply that times 12 to get our yearly total (their weekend income is probably 2x as much, so it comes out to $1360, twice as much as normal). Since we know that their income over two weeks is $1500, that tells us the number of months it takes. We divide that number by 30 days (because we don't want to consider a 30 day month), and get 5 months. So, we start counting by month, and do the math afterward. \n\nThat would be $1080 x 5, or $5400. $1360 x 5, would be $6300, $7700, $9100, and so on. All $1360's become $6300's, $770's become $9100's, and so on. Then, the difference between the 1360' and 1080 is 280, which multiplied by the total weeks is 280 times 52 is 14,160.", "answer": " 21600"}

{"text": "She used 4 ounces of oil.\n\n### Reason:There are 8 cups in 1 pound of peanuts. In addition, she made 2 1/4 cups of the blended mixture. Since peanuts are 16 ounces to the pound, there would be 1/4 cuos added to the batch. Four cups is equal to 5.12 oz.; 1/4 cup is equal to 1.26 cups. The solution states that the batch total is equal to 20 - 1/4. If 8 ounces of peaunuts is one pound, the 20 ouncer is 20 ounes, which is equal to 2 pounds. The ratio of oil to peanuts equals 8 ounces in one pound. 8 ounces divided by 1.26 is 6.4242. Since four cups is 5.12 ounces, the solution yields that four cups is equal to either 6.42 oil or 4.82 peanuts. The answer must be equal to 6.42 or 4.8 to be the right answer because one cup of peanuts weighs 7 ounces. 4.82 oil is 4.3383 ounces and 3.68729 peanuts, which is the same as a rounded 4.8. She used the exact ratio of oil to peans when she used three quarters cup of oil in one whole cup of peanuts. The ratio of 8 oil to peanuts is the same as 2 ounces to four cups of oil, but 2 ounces is in a whole cup and 2 ounces out of a cup is a quarter cup. She used the exact amount of oil and did not use any peanuts. The weight of oil is 2.26 ounces per cup. 8 cups equals 16 ouncs and there were 4.8 ounces of oil, but the equation states: Sonja uses 2 ounces of oil in a whole cup. The 2 ounces equals 16 /4. 8, and equals 4 ounces, which is", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "22\n\n### Explaination:\nI'll show you two ways of how to solve this. One will be a little bit more lengthier. One will be shorter.\n\nSolution 1:\n\nThe first thing we need to do is we need to get the amount of apples Carla had the morning, after she puts them in her backpack. To do this, we will use a simple loop statement. We put all 94 (97 apples) in an array. Then we loop through the array, and each time we are looping, we are subtracting one apple from an array, the index of the current loop. We are checking every time if the index is equal to the amount of apples we have left (in our case 8).\n\nWe are checking if the value equals to 1. When the checking happens, we know than we are not dealing with the first apple any more, and that apple is not available for Carla to eat for lunch the next day. And so we remove it from the loop, and it is also removed from the array because of the loop statement.\n\nEvery time we are removing one of the apples from the loop, the amount of apples left is decreasing, and the amount of apples in the array is also decreasing.\n\nEvery loop is starting by subtracting one, and ending without removing anything. What is left is 8.\n\nSo the index to keep track of our 8 apples is 7. And as a result of the loop, we get 8. So what we get is 84.\n\nNow in our second loop, we will see how many of this 84 Carla was able to eat for lunch, because we know the amount of apples she had for lunch. We will know the amount of appled she had for lunch because in her backpack, she will be left with an amount of apples equal to the amount of Carla's lunch, because the loop removes the 22 apples.\n\nWith what amount of apples we start the second loop, we will do so by using the nextIndexOf. It returns the first index that greater or equal to the specified value (the amount of apples Carles for lunch). So by using the nextIndex. We are getting 85. At the end of our second loop, our backpack", "answer": " 45"}

Why the hell not? And just say why it's the opposite, and it's the truth!\n\n### Response:\"I just realized why!\", he cried, his nose all red. \"The math question said the train was moving faster than five kilometers per hour, which was faster than slowpoke. The answer was that the math question was wrong. The question didn't ask whether the man was moving faster than the bear! It only said that the bear had a higher speed. It implied that the train was moving slower!\"\n\n### Request:Explain the math question and your response.\n\n### Response 1:First off, we're told  that the train is going as fast as 16 km per hour, then I'm told that it takes no more than 10 minutes to travel to a particular station. If you can multiply x by x, as Bobo the bear did, the number doesn't change and the train is moving faster than x km/hr. The bear is saying that the train is traveling at a slower rate than 16 km/hr. The answer, however, is quite obvious. If you're traveling faster than 16 km per hr, it isn't going to take more than 10 mins to move from one place to another. If a train moves at 16 km/hour and the train goes to a particular station. It will take 10 mins.\n\n### Request 2:Explain the math problem in a clearer way.\n\n### Answer 2:We're told  that Bobo is saying the train is moving slower than 16 km / hr. This is because Bobo the bear is telling us that the train is moving", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "Answer choice (or explanations): 3 packs of 5\nExplanation:\nLet\u2019s say that the 4,000 cupcakes were made into 100 packages of 40. Each package contains 10 cupcakers and a package of 10 cupcake=400 each. 400/10 =40 packages needed for 100 cupcake, therefore need 400 total cupcakes. That is 4 x 100 packages = 400 cupcakes needed. Four packages give 320 cupcakes, so need eight packages. Jean will need 8 packages of cupcakes containing 40 cupcakes total. She bought 5 for each package. If she bought 3 packages with 20 cupcakes in them she would be 6 cupcakes short.\nThis solution contains 15 cupcakers and need 100 children. If she gives each child 1 cupcake, she will have to give 200 cupcakes. If she bought 4 packages with 5 cupcakes in them, she would be 100 cupcakes short.

The town's post office delivers mail to over 180 houses. The post office has 3 people who work on 5 days to deliver the mail and 3 people who work 2 days. 2 delivery men and 2 ladies from the mail department make about 365 deliveries per day. If each child and adult walked to school and the business of the city separately then it would take about 101 minutes. Everyone would arrive at school and work at about 7:00 a.m. Then everyone would arrive at the city with a few minutes to spare. There were 399 deliveries made in one day during a week when the post office had 600 deliveries for a day. In that scenario, the post office worked a 2-day week which the children and adults didn't do. But, when the workers walked to school and work, there were 2 of them that needed to be substituted for the extra day because they worked extra to meet the demands. In those last few hours before they started, the city had less than the average. \nIn this example, the post office had 9 people working, 4 for 1 day and 5 for 2 days. Everyone took an hour lunch break and a 30 minute break to rest. If the post office had 382 deliveries then 6 people would be working and it would be a longer lunch break and rest time. At 382, it would be a long lunch break, rest time and one-hour late to meet the other", "answer": " 96"}

Just using a member in the method\n### Explanations:\nCalling back a class member means use its value in another function.\n\n#  What was added in this function?\n### Explanatoins:\nThere are 4 main parts in the function, as follows:\n1. First, we define a 2-dimention array.\n2. Then, we loop through the array and check if it exists in another array we called the target array.\n3. If so, it'd call `return` with a boolean value, and if it's true,it'll raise an index error, and otherwise, it'd raise a division by zero error.\n4. Lastly, the function return a new array.\n\n#  When we run your code, what does the program tell us \"can't find an input 'x'\"?\n### Explanatations:\nIt can't find a specific number in the list named 'x'.\n#  What would that line look like if you wanted to use a non-integer?\n### Explnations:\nIf we want to use a non-integart number, we should provide the type of the variable with 'int'.\n\n#  Why does this raise a value error?\n### Explantions:\nIt can' traise a value error because a function return only number, not text.\n\n#  How might you fix this code so that it works?\n## Explantions:\nThe `int` should provide before a number so that it can be casted to an int.\n\n#  You are writing a code that calculates how much money you spend on groceries.

This was easy to program because the program uses the same code as before.\n\n**Step 2:** In this step I coded so that it would be able to ask a question to the user and take in an answer, then ask another question. The user has to answer with the choice of \"A\" or \"B\" for their answer before the next question begins.\n\n**Step3 :** In this step I created a function to create the program. I used my code from the previous step to create the questions for the program. I created a function that loops for however many questions the user wants. I also created a list that the list holds the questions and answers. The other part of this step is the output that it prints to the user when the questions have been answered.\n\n**Step4 :** In this step, I tested the program to make sure it was working as I intended it to work. At first it didn't work because I had to make sure I didn't type in code that wouldn't work with the code. I also needed to make sure I made sure that the program printed all the different questions and answered them.\n\n**Step5 :** In this step the output wasn't changing from the original output because I made one small mistake in my code. Originally the code looked like this:\ndef printToInput(userChoice):\n    if userChoice == \"a\":\n        print(\"What you're going to need is something at A. Here is the answer: {}\\n\".format(A))\n    elif userChoice == \"b\":\n        print(\"B! That answer is B!\\n\".format(B))\n    else:\n        print(\"This is not the answer to the question.\\n\".format(A)\n\nIt should read like this: def printToInput(userChoices):\nprint(\"Question: Where could you find something that isn'", "answer": " 1210"}

It is possible to have an equation such as three-fourths divided by one, but we know from our knowledge of ratios that three-fourths is the same as three divided by four. In the case of this question we know that the response can only be done in fraction form because we do not know if it is meant that one should write numerically as one-third divided by four, or if it means to divide one-third by four as fractions, or if it is meant both numerically as one-three divided by four, and also as one divided by three-four. The answer given is correct because it includes both the numerator and the denominator of the fractional equation, and for this reason, the answer is 0.75, because 1/4=0.25 and 1/3 = 0.33.

Here comes the fun - there are a few ways to figure this one out!  1st, let's try it where there is no logic. Example: 3312331\n\nIn the sequence there is 2 and 3 that appear together, then there is 1 alone, this alone is a hint for the following question. 3312 has been broken into 331 and 321.  Then there is 1 with no 2's after, then 1 alone, then there is 2 with no 1's after because you need to get to 3 to complete this answer.\n\nIn this case, the 1's and 2 are not in a sequence any longer. So you are 3/4 or 5/5 away from completing this problem. Now you need to know the next clue to 3312. If you look at 4/5 - there is a 4 and 12 - there are 2's. You can now figure out that 2, 4, and 5 are all numbers.  You can use those three numbers to figure out a sequence. Since 2, 4 and 5 are all in the sequence we came of with 3312 this time.\n\nIf 2-4-5, are the same then 7 is next. The numbers that come after are now on the 4 and 5.\n\n1468 is next. Then we use the second way we figured it out. If 3312 - is the first sequence then 1468 is the next", "answer": " 11"}

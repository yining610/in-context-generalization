How much will a $1,500,0000 apartment cost in the next 20 years? $2000/month\nOutput: $2800/month\n\n### Solution:\n#### The best thing about this question is that it contains a lot of numbers. All you have to do is simply plug in values, calculate them using logic and make the system tell you the answer :).\nThe key strategy is to focus on 2 things:\n - The number of questions: I recommend doing 3 of this questions so that you have a rough idea of how this works (instead of giving 6 questions that are all close to each other, you should spread the question mark 3-4 questions in between).\n - The difficulty level: I recommend to give questions that require little knowledge in math. So, questions like multiplication, division, addition, subtraction are good examples. You can start with some easy addition subtraction division or multiplication, when people start understanding it, then you can move on to harder questions and when people get the hang of it, then you could increase the difficulty of answers. It really depends on the difficulty level of the math aptitude test of the college you are willing to get in.\n \nYou have to understand that math questions have more than a single solution. Some people are very smart, they will be able to solve the question in just 5 seconds, others will spend 2 minutes to solve it and they usually have other methods. So, instead of worrying, just let the machine do its work and make it tell you the answer.\n#### The second step is to learn what type of problems they are. If you are not sure about how to use python, then start with this [book](https://github.com/sandeephq/Math-Aptitude-Class-Notes/blob/master/math/python-book.pdf)", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "60\n\n### Instructions : Read the following statements and explain what the code is saying for each.\n\n1. The value of the variable a is zero\n\nThis program is asking you to set a variable and value it to whatever initial value you would like to.  This program has been started by telling the computer what the variable name(variable a) is and what the initial value for it will be.  In this case the initial value is going to be set to zero.  This zero will represent the original value that has not been set by the programmer, so the original zero or nothing was stored in this variable.\n\n2. The variable y is assigned 3 more than a\n\nThe variable y has been set to store additional value which will hold the variable a plus 3. \n\n3. Add ten to the variable c\n\nIn this instruction we are adding ten to the value of variable that has been assigned to a specific variable.   \n\n4. Increment the variable n by 2\n\nThe increment function is a instruction that is given to computers which allows the processor to automatically add values that have been previously stored there. in this case we are adding 2 to the value of the variable n, the initial value is going into the variables incremental memory, the value which has been used and been stored there and then the value which will be automatically added to that value.  In this case we are adding two to whatever was last stored there with the n variable and then we are storing that value again into the computer memory but this time we are adding 2 more to the value.\n\n5. Increment the variable c by 1\n\nThis instruction is the same as instruction 4 but it applies to the variable c. \n\n6. Increment the variable a\n\nThis instruction is very similar to the instruction 4 and 5, but this time the instruction we are given is the increase value of the variable a.  Which means that we are adding 1 automatically to the value of variable a and then saving that value there after.\n\n7. Add the value to the variable b by the value to the variable sum\n\nThis instruction is asking you to add b's value to the value that has been stored with the variable sum, this is asking you to create a sum that holds values that are stored in the variables.\n\n8. Decrement the variable n by 4", "answer": " 65"}

He\u2019d already hiked a 24-hour race of 100 miles earlier this year, but he thought a 100-mile race through the mountains this weekend would be a piece of cake. On Saturday, he and a trail partner left the campsite bright and early and set a steady pace to their destination. After 2 hours walking, they reached the only stream on their route with water. They thought it would help to swallow it. The stream tasted horrible. Halfway through, Steven stopped to throw up, and he continued vomiting intermittently for the rest of the hike. In addition to the water, the hikers ate a variety of junk food and snacks while hiking. Steven hates fish. On Sunday, Steven felt as bad as humanly possible to the point where he couldn\u2019t walk. His trail partner insisted they couldn\u2019t stop now and had to walk to their destination, and they were at least a day behind the other teams. The sun was setting and the trail became nearly undetectable. The two hikers decided the trail had been destroyed by an animal or other natural force. Their trail eventually disappeared under a landslide. They thought they were at the bottom of a valley. They saw one of the other teams as they were climbing their mountain. The teams had been hiking together for a few hours, and one of the hiker\u2019s packs had a broken buckle. After a couple of hours, the hiker fell asleep and his pack fell off his back. The other team stopped to offer help. They wanted to climb up a snowy peak to the left of them. The hikers knew it would be a few hours before the other team reached the top. The teams met again by the ridge after midnight. The hikers had climbed into the mountain. They found a small camp of other hikers who were already asleep. A hiker named Susan invited the hikers to the campsite. She had climbed 50 miles herself and she needed help. Steven helped Susan and her team climb the peak. The hiker asked if Steven wanted to camp with them. Steven woke Susan up several times. They tried to ask him questions he didn\u2019t understand.

I did this because I thought that it would be easier and I was doing a lot of thinking.\n\n## Did a classmate already ask a similar question?:Answer: No I was the only person that needed help with this question.\n\n## What concepts were you solidifying?:Answer: The concepts that I was solidifying were the concepts of addition and subtraction. In this set of problems I was adding and subtracting multiple things. I was also solidifying how to subtract more difficult problems. For example, I had to subtract by taking away from a higher digit instead of just subtracting the higher numbers away.\n\n## Is there anything that the question or project has left you wondering?:Answer: Yes I have been wondering how to use this way of problem solving in other situations.\n\n## What is your next step:Answer: I think that I need to find a way to write down the question without being stuck in how I am solving it. I have done this for a few questions but I am still having trouble once I get into the problems.\n\n## What are you still stuck on?:", "answer": " 1"}

If we imagine the top of the floor to be a circle, then the area of the top floor is the shaded area. (We have to subtract the area of the circle from the square area.) The area of the top floor's circle is 1+ Pi(r^2) where r is 1/2 of the side length. The top area is smaller than the bottom area, because there is an extra layer of thickness on the top floors, but the extra thickness cancels out the extra height since the top floors are completely round.\n\n(So, if we had an 8 inch tall cube in a square area of 16 square inches, and we rounded off the top, the area of the bottom floor is 16 square inches and the area of the top is 4.0 + Pi(2^2))\n\nOutput: (this one I didn't get.

Choices: \nA: yes B: always C: maybe D: not always\nOutput: B: always\n\n###Instruction:The numbers represent the prices of certain products at two different stores. We are interested in how large a discount the customer receives when choosing to shop at the other store. For example if the customer is buying coffee from the first store, and the coffee at the other store costs $1.75 less per cup, then the discount is $1.75. If the customer is buying sugar from the first store then they receive $1.25 less for their money than at the other store. Your job is to find the number of times the customer is able to receive the most discount. What is this number?\n\n### Output: 7\n\n### Answer: The numbers represent the prices of a range of products at two different stores that sell the same products. We are interested in the discount the customer receives by choosing one store over the other. To determine this discount we have to determine if the store the customer will choose will provide them with the most discount. For example if the price at Store A is $2.99, and at store B it is $2.25, then the discount received for the first product would be $0.74 per cup. If the price at Store A for the second product is $3.00, then the discount the customer would receive by choosing this product would be $0.05 cheaper. If the price at store B is $2.36, then again the discount the customer is able to get is $0.64 cheaper per cup of coffee. In total the customer is then able to get a discount of (0.74)+(0.64)+(0.05)=$0.75 cheaper for their money by shopping at the other store. The most discount is ( 0.75 )= 0.075 cheaper per item on average. In total a customer is then able to save (1.0)(1.0)(1)(0.75)=7 cents per item.", "answer": " 6"}

So, two off his three lesser letters leaves him with a name that has seven letters in it. Bobbie must have a very long name so that subtracting the two letters from her last name makes it equal to jamies.

If you are thinking to yourself, but $.41 isn't 28 cents, there could be a missing 0. Yes that is correct. The reason that we found a 4 was because when you calculate. (You take the cost of money/how many people are going to eat out every day.) So, 13 times 28= $.41. But, there is still a little room for difference because the 4 might still represent a 0.

{"text": "155\n\n### Justification:\n\nLet's assume the minutes from advertising are all in the form of a constant r except for the first 2 minutes of the newscast, which is the introduction. In this example, our r = 3, meaning on average, each 3 minutes of the newscasts contains 3 minutes of advertisements.\n\nLet's work backward and try to come up with what our x is.\n\nLet' mean each  x minutes of national news, international news, sports, and weather contains on average advertisements because if we multiply 12x5x5x2, we will get our 155 minutes.\n\nLet'x = (2 + 5 + 5 + 2) - (((2 + 5 +5 +2)/ 12) x 100) = 79. Therefore, each 79 minutes of the newscaste x, contains advertisements.\nBecause each 79 minutes x contains advertisements, we plug 3 minutes x 79 minutes in  and solve for x x.\n3x79 = 155\nDivide both sides of equation with 155 155\n3 x 79 = 100\n3 = 100 (rounded down)\n\nTherefore, the answer is 100 minutes of advertisement. The reason why we did this backwards is because we know our r. What if our r wasn't available? We would take what we know to be right away and start backwards. If we knew our r, we wouldn't use 100 as our x.\nLet's do that here.\n\nIf our r were the only available info we weren't given, we would have to start out with our x. If we put 3 in for advertising, it's only natural that the other minutes of a newscast that is not r would be divided by 12 to come up with minutes (or x) of advertisement without any prior knowledge of the r. We could do it like this: each of the other 12 minutes each minute of the newscast contains advertisements. This number is 1. The only known part is 2 minutes of advertisements for the introduction.\nWe know that", "answer": " 6"}

The answer given above should be:\n```\n\t2 - 8 = -6\n```\n3. The average daily rain totals for the given weather conditions are:\n\n**Monday: 0.4 in\n\nTuesday:  2 in\n\nWednesday:0 in\n\nThursday:  2 in**\n\n4.

Just be super confident and don't overthink, just let the interviewer know what they have asked, and then let them know how to use that information to answer the question. It is always best to use an example to describe such a scenario because when you tell the interviewer \"The train is late.\" The interviewer can't use that information to find that the train is actually 2 hours early. But if you say \"The train was supposed to leave at X:XX and it is now leaving at **_______**\" That is helpful information for the interviewer. It's important to use numbers here to make it easier for the interviewer to see that you are right but don't over do it, stick to the most direct route, and then you don't have to explain your answer, you just tell the interviewer and they can do the math from there.\n\n>Note: This question is the MOST important question to ask your interviewer before asking them for a job. \n\n### Input\n\n>Input: 1/4 of 25 cents\n\n### Expect Output\n\n>Answer: 6.25\n\n### Reasons:\n\n#### Mathematical Reason:\n\nWe know", "answer": " 26"}

A person, who has committed fraud, can be imprisoned. For theft, it is also possible to pay a monetary penalty for the damage caused to the person or business. This case shows how to use two different methods to recognize counterfeit U.S. currency.\n\nThe first method uses a currency detector as follows:\n\n1. Identifies a bill by visually inspecting it, checking the paper, ink, serial numbers, and so on.\n\n    You have the option to skip to the next step.\n\n2. Turns over the bill, looks for the denomination, and verifies.\n\nThis method is useful because it allows you to verify the integrity of the transaction. You can test bills using a currency detector (or a currency detector device, which is a program) based on the criteria listed in the table below.\n\n### Table 1. Criteria in the currency detector\n\n| Currency Detector | Criteria                                                       |\n| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **U.S. Currency** | \u2022 Visually inspect the currency, look for any marks, and check the denominations. |\n| \u2022 Turn the bill over and, if necessary, look for the watermarks, serial numbers, and denominations. |\n\nIn the image below, you can see what the currency detector looks like.\n\n![In the currency detector](assets/currency-detector.PNG)\n\nThe second method uses the U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing (BEP)", "answer": " 3"}

The witch\u2019s sister got angry and started to cry. The witch did not care because it was her sister who had hurt the Princess. She said, \"It's ok my witchy sister. The princess will be fine and so will you\". She went to sleep and had fun playing with her toys, which is not what she should have done. The next day the witch woke up and discovered that her sister was dead. The witch was very angry and decided to take revenge.

{"text": "(The response should be in the form of a table)\n### Answer: The distance can be calculated from the starting point to destination.

At starting point the bus driver can travel at a maximum of 1 hour on 55 miles, but while returning the driver can cover 10 miles at distance. At destination the driver can spend his time at maximum of 2 hours and that\u2019s the reason why the driver should reach destination in 2 hours. It is observed that the time spent decreased after covering each additional mile  from starting point to the destination. It will take 0.5hours to reach destination and after that 2.5 hours to return to the starting point.

{"text": "After reviewing the above instructions, the task appears to be:\n\nWhat is the average pay of the experienced sailors? The calculation of this answer involves three operations.\n\n\nThe first operation includes the use of the words **each and total**. The sentence says: \"The total combined monthly earning of _the experienced sailors_ could be calculated.\" Let's look at the words **total** and **each** separately.\n\n**Each:** This word has a definition that includes the phrase [\"one to each\"] and an example in which someone has seven pencils and there is \"one for each\". The task instructs us to **calculate** the total combined pay of the experienced sailor. This means **one** experience sailor could be used in our calculation. Our initial guess was to use 17 as the total number experienced sailors. In actuality the total number is too large.\n\n**Total:** This word is defined as [\"the complete amount or sum of something\"] and an example in the definition provided is: \"A total of $12,000 was raised\". The task tells us to calculate the \"average pay of the experience sailors.\" Average pay is expressed using the mathematical phrase **divide by** ( ). The task provides two pieces of information.\n\n1. There are 5 fewer inexperienced (not experienced) sailors.\n2. The inexperienced salary is $10.\n\nThe task does not provide us with the number of experienced sailors or their pay. Using the given information and the mathematical phrase: **total divided by** ( ) we can solve the question. I think you will do very well on the next step of this task.\n\n### Operation:\n\nWe can perform the three operations to obtain an answer when the task says: **We can perform the three (3) operations to obtain an answer.**\n\n### Question\nWhat is the average price paid to all of the experienced sailors ($/hr)?\n\n### Step 1:\nThe task said:\n\nWhat would your first guess be?\n\nThe task also said:\n\nHow did your first guess solve the problem?\n\n### Step2:\nTo calculate the average, we must first calculate the total before we divide. The operation is to use subtraction.\n\n \nThe task said", "answer": " 34560"}

Using the inverse of the above equation we find\n\nM <-- (1/2)+ (1/2)\n\nSince the equation is linear - as seen by its nature of adding and subtracting the same amount - we can write it as (2*x) + (2*x) = x, where x = 1.  This is because we have M as the output and when divided by 2 we get M1 and M2. Multiplying by 2 gives us (M1+ M2) = M' or the output. \n\nSo, for the equation:\n\nLet (2*M1) + (2 *M2) <-- (2*M)\n\nFrom the above we have M1 + M2 = M\n\nCombining what we know and M1 + M2 and M = 1 is found, we find that M2 = 2/3\n\nAlso, since the equation is linear M3 = (2*M2) = 8\n\nSo, M1 + M2 + M3 = 1 + (2/3) + 8 = 3\n\n### B:\nM = 3\n\n3 * 3 = 9\n\n9 * 3 = 27\n\nWe are now left with 27 and since M = 3  we apply the same formula as above\n\n27/2 * 27 = 54\n\nRemainder is 1\n\n### C:\n\n1/2\n\nM1 = 1\n\n1/2", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Ann serves a total of 68 customers in one day.\n\n### Explanation:\nLet A = Ann, B = Becky, J = Julia. First, we will find how many customers did Ann and Becky had together. \nSince the service was 7 customers per hour, therefore 20 customers were attended to per hour. \nIn Ann's first hour, she served 2 customers, at 2 customers per hour it would take her 1 hour to serve up to 4 customers. In a way, in Ann's 2nd hour she would serve 4 customers. Then in Ann's 3rd hour, she would serve 5 customers, then Ann would only serve 1 customer in her last hour because she'd served a total of 8 customers during her first 7 hours. Therefore, this way, Ann had served a total of 64 customers with only Becky having served 24 customers.\n\nNext, we will find how long it took Julia to work for 6 hours.\nEach customer required 7 minutes to be served. This is because 1 hour = 7 * 4 customers, where 4 customers will take 7 minutes to be attended to 3 minutes per customer. If Julia had an average of 7 minutes to serve each customer and had 4 to 5 minutes earlier. She will be taking 12 minutes to serve each customer. Julia would work 6 hours.\nTherefore, a total of 72 customers were served.\n\n### Solution:\nLet Ann = 64, Julia = 12", "answer": " 154"}

{"text": "We have to use a method called the rule of three, which means we add $276 (S) times 4(t) times 100(y) to find y. We do this by dividing the piggy bank total by 3, multiply the total by 4 the 3 x t y. Now we know that x equals to y is y equals to 16k, where k is the number of years. 36000 is x divided by 3. 12,000 is x times 4. 16 is x x 100.\n\nWe now understand the problem better by solving it. To solve this problem, substitute k and 36 and -2k for k and -36 respectively into 16y. Now we have a formula that allows us to find the value of y.\n\nFinding the value of y is the same as finding the factorial n. Therefor n! = 1 x2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 for all n.\n\nNow we use a similar formula where we find the solution of the problem but simplify. Substitute -2 and k for 1 x 2 x 3 x x4 x 7 x 8 for all n. Therefore the formula becomes 13 x k x 2k x 3k x 4k\n\nWe can create a pattern as the sum of these powers and the pattern would be 19 x a x 19a. We can solve it by creating two squares. Now the answer is 35 x 2(100)\n\n### Notes:\n\nWe can also use an algebraic method by simply adding our value of k together to create a sum of the powers of the sum. This would be: We can multiply this by 3 and our answer would be 35. This is an algebraic solution that does not divide the total number by three and simplify.\n\n### Requirements:\n\n* Response must be a paragraph (at least 250 words)\n* There must be more than 4 sentences\n* 4 grammar, spelling, syntax, and/or sentence structure errors are the worst you can have\n\n### Marking Rubric:\n\n* Response was submitted at least a week after posting (i.e. one week late)", "answer": " 23248"}

{"text": "```The problem states that there are 12 hours total time to renovate everything. The instructions say to convert hours to days so that 12 hours is converted to 1 days and 12 hours is the same as 1 days. Let H stand for hours to renovate things and let D stand for days to renovate things. The equations are:\n\n\tH = D \\times 24\n\tD = H \\times 24 / 12\n```\n\nThe problem state that there are three bedrooms and each bedrooms takes four hours to renovate. If 12 hours are used to renovate everything, it is safe to say there is only 1 bedroom. Each bedroom takes 4\\*3\\*24 / 1 = 24 hours. 4\\*3 = 12 hours.\n\nThe problem states that the kitchen takes 50\\% of the time required to renovate a bedroom. If one room takes 24 hours, you can determine that the other room takes 12\\*50\\% =6 hours.  That means the kitchen took 24 + 6= 30 hours.\n\nAs for the living room, let's think about what is stated. The problem states that it took twice as much time to renovate everything as it did to renovate the kitchen.

{"text": "The answer is 100 feet, this can be done with some simple reasoning. The short sides are 3x the long sides, which implies that with a long side at one length there are more short sides. Since the fence is 640, 3x means there are 212 (or 660/3). 212 is almost equal to 200, so 1 of the 3 sections has 200 feet. 200/2 = 100 feet of fence needs to be replaced\n\n### Additional Information:\n\nAdditional information is that the teacher was frustrated that the students were not understanding the concept.

Since then it has become the go to program for my students when they do not get an answer they understand.  This year I have been able to make this program more helpful by changing how it works to allow for the more than one person working on the problem.\n\n- 2019: Added some additional functions.  Allowed for multiple users at the same time, added more questions and rewrote questions to make them more intuitive.  Created ability to select a difficulty. \n\n## Credits:\n\nThe following people can have an impact on the success of this project: my students, and my staff. \n\nThe staff, especially the staff that helped and still do help me on my journey to create better education experiences.\n\nThe students, I want to give a special thanks to those few students that are still continuing to support this project.

What the program should do is to output the answer based on the program's knowledge of how the sample input should work.

Is there any that you would suggest or if I use one of the above will i be alright?\n\nComment: @sat: Both of the choices I mention are good ones, and are quite general. The Python one (pyparsing) has a simple syntax that gives pretty good results, but can be limited by the number of keywords.

{"text": "8\n\nOutput 2: This problem contains too much data for a grade math question. It should probably be removed.\n\nInput: This is a multi-part question. Your answer doesn't need to contain all of the information presented in this problem.\nA small amount of radioactive material can exist for thousands of years or longer before all or most of the radioactivity has stopped. This is not true for most natural substances. A natural element can never be radioactive. However, there are some elements that are \"radioactive in appearance\" but are not truly radioactive. You'll never hear someone refer to uranium or radium as radioactive, or even as radioactive appearing. But when a scientist is referring to a group of elements called \"actinides,\" there are radioactive elements that look very radioactive. The entire group of elements called \"radon\" are what is known as \"radioactive appearings.\" All of the radon elements have the same atomic number as potassium. They are 47 protons away from being radium, and 84 protons away from being uranium.\nWhere would you find a rock made of a \"radioactive appearing\" element? How close would you have to dig for this rock to have some exposure to the outside? You'll need the atomic number to answer this question.\n\nChoices:  A: In the sand - 6 ft.

As you move backward, you do not move forward, but backward. Similarly, as you move upward, then you do not move downward. You do not see this type of thinking when walking forward and downward, but it can be useful for thinking about any of these questions. You almost always can think about what you are actually doing as you describe in words to yourself when moving, so always write down these steps and then come up with a counter-example of how things would change if John were backwards or if Mary was walking downward (or upward).\n\nThese questions are very useful for learning about 3D space.\n\n# Author: Toni Sunger and Jolissa Reyes (2018 UCSD CS16)\n\n# Part 1:\n\n**Question 1.** The teacher didn't ask for an answer and work but also for the students what exactly to show and also prove.

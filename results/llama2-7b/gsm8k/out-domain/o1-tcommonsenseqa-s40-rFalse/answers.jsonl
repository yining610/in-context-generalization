There was 2 hours of work left before she went home and she wanted to complete as much of it as possible. She was tired after the last 15 minutes of work.\n\n### Solution:\nIt will take her 1000 minutes to complete it.\n\n### Explanation:\nMultiply that by one-sixth to get the proportion of how much of the 1000 total minutes is worked. 1/6 of 1000=166.6\n\nIt took 166.6 minutes to work that amount of time.

The internet has been around for a long time, dating back to the inception of the internet in the early 1980s. It wasn't until the late 1990s when the internet started spreading to the average citizen, and eventually a large number of internet-connected devices. While some people thought the internet would become accessible to all, the internet never got anywhere near as accessible as many people thought it would.\n\nOne reason why the internet never became accessible to all people as everyone expected, is that no one knows how many people have access to all the information on the internet. The only way to know is by checking the source of what people are able to access on the internet. There are a number of tools available to do this, but the internet is vast and constantly changing. Even though there are dozens of ways to access the world of the internet, not everyone can access those tools or methods of accessing the world of the internet. This was made clear when the internet became more accessible in the late 1980's and in the late 1800's.\n\n### Wide-ranging results and limited access.\nThe internet has always been a wide-ranging phenomenon. It was not until the 1950's that the WorldWideWeb became accessible to the average person, and now it has become accessible in every country and every age. As a result of these wide-ranging results, there are always new methods of accessing the internet that are coming out, many of which never reach the mainstream. In addition to the rise in the cost of accessing the internet, many webpages don't even exist. This has made it impossible for the average person to access the internet. \n\n### What is the biggest threat to internet accessibility?\nThe biggest threat to internet access is the lack of available internet-connected webpages. Even though there are tons of internet websites, they are not accessible to the average citizen. That's because not everyone has the time, money, or ability to use these methods of", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Answer: I have solved the problem as follows:\n\nSuppose there are $12$ history books, $8$ of romance type, $4$ of poetry type, and $(5 + 6)$ biographies and western books. So there are $12+8+4+2$ books. Then Nancy started by shelving $12+8=20$ number of books. She had $(5 + 6)=11$ books left. She started putting mystery books to the bottom. She shelved $11*1/2=5.5$ of them to the bottom. Then she started putting the rest $6.5$ and shelves $4$ western and $6$ biographies. So the amount of books on the shelf when she started is $(12+8+6.5)+(11*1/3)$ which is $30.5$.\n\n\n### Explanation:\n\nFirst, she started by putting $18$ books on the shelf. Then, she put the left ones from the cart: $(5+6)=11$. So, the total is $18+11=29$. Then, after this she started to put half from the other side so she should put $(5+6)/2=5.5$. Then she put the rest of the number of books equal to $6.5$. And finally, she put the $4$ western and the $6$ biographics. So the total is $6.5+6=12.5$.\n\n### Expected Response:\n\nYou should explain your thinking and answer the question in complete sentences, using proper grammar and spelling.

{"text": "Caleb initially picked 40 dandy lions but handed them out to the others in unequal quantities. The dog received two dandelions while the mom received three. The other person received nine and the grandmother received eleven. The child had eleven left as well. In that sense, each person received 3 + 11 = 14  dandy lions.\n\n### Input (Math):The first year that Tom and Amy both lived in the same location, Tom only used $3000 of the water supply which cost $110 a month. The second year that they lived in the same location Amy only used $2000 of the supply and Tom used $7000. How much water did Tom use the second year that he and Amy were at the same location?\n\n### Demorstration:\nThe supply cost $110 per month so that cost is $110 per $1000 spent. So, Tom spent $7000 for which he should pay $700.\n\nNext, Amy used $200 less than Tom. We have $(7000 * (3000/110)-2000)\n\nAnd finally, if Tom used 150 less water than Amy, we have:\n\n$\\(7000 * \\left(3000 - \\left(30 + \\frac{\\left(400 - 150\\right)}{110}\\right)\\right)\\)\n\nThis yields the same answer as above for Tom's usage which gives us that Amy used $2023 water and Tom used $6973.\n\nNow, for our answer. We have an unknown in $7000*(110*3000) that we need to find. We can substitute the values we found for the $x$. Doing so, we have an equation for the value.\n\n$$\\frac{10500 * 3000}{110 * 7000 = x \\Rightarrow (345000/700000) = x$$which is in simplest form is $(34.5/70) = x$ and since $10 > 7$ we can divide by $2$ to get $1", "answer": " 9"}

With so many choices, it wouldn\u2019t be so easy to decide what kind of cookie she would bake.  But she only has 2 hours to bake the cookies.  She asked her friend, Risa, to help her choose what type of cookie to bake.  Sandra\u2019s grandmother likes chocolate, nuts, and chewy cookies, and would only like a new cookie that she hasn\u2019t tried before.  What can she and Risa do to help Sandra choose what type of cookie she should bake?\n\n### Demostration:\nSandra can use the decision tree method to choose which cookie she should bake. In the tree, for each choice, she can have Sandra decide whether or not to continue to the next decision. She could go to either 1, 2, or 3. In each case, there are different selections from the choices. So, at the end of the process, she would have 1, 2 or 3 options according to which branch was chosen.  Then the final question is, which is the best choice. This decision tree can be used to make decisions in all kinds of situations.\n\n### Response\n1. There are some choices that can have a yes or no for each. But then, when reaching the decision, there are different choices available. 2. Once they know that they are choosing what kind of cookie that the grandmother hasn\u2019t tried before, they could have used a Venn Diagram.  They could just keep listing the types that Sandra can use, but maybe for the first branch, the diagram would be helpful to list everything that Sandra is choosing from.  In the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th branches, Risa and Sandra can create branches where there are more and more choices, but they wouldn\u2019t have to add all of the choices, they should only consider the ones that Sandra is going to consider.\n3. This has to do with making decisions, making choices, or doing something in general.

They were in a big, comfortable car and could tell that they were on their familiar street, a street they'd driven down thousands of times before. The trees on both sides were the same size, same position, same color as usual. There were no animals, no buildings, and no other people walking or driving. After a few minutes, they started to worry. John pulled over and stopped, and they got out of the car. The street looked exactly like it had when they began driving. The trees weren't any smaller. They walked down the street for six miles but they saw nothing except trees, cars, and houses. It was as if they were the only two people on earth. After 14 miles, they were beginning to panic. They didn't know what to do, but they finally decided to stop.

How many multiples are there between 5 and 20 of 5?\n\n### Demostration:\n- We could say 5 is a multiple of 10 but not a multiple of 1.  \n- It is obvious we can have 10 multiples of 5 in between 5 and 10.\n- Once we add 11 to 10 multiples, we can have further 10 multiples in between 7 and 15.\n- Next, we add 10 to start our last 10 multiples and finish our set with 10 multiples to reach 20.\n\nAnswer: 17\n\n### Demonicstration\nInput:\nThree times six times fifteen minus ten is fourteen.  Is three times six minus ten a multiple of 15?\n\n\nResponse:\n- We know that 15 is a multiple of three and thirty so that means that 12 is a multiple\n- 3 x 6 x 15 \n= 18 x 15  (we already know our answer to be 14)\n= 270\n= 269 + 1 (12)\n= 246 (15)\n= 36 (4)\n=  4 x 6 x 3\n= 108  \n- Now we know that if three x six is 18 then six doesn't take our original fifteen down.

{"text": "- Write a complete, properly-formatted function.\n- Use the function to complete the problem.\n\n### Explanation:\nThe number of cards Miguel got must be less than or equal to 12. Therefore:\nC = 12\n\nRick's sisters got three cards. They split the remaining cards. If we call the number of cards they have \"living\", we can see that the total living card count is:\nH = (C + 1) + 2\n\nWe know that the total of all the cards Rick gave away was exactly twice what he kept for hisself. Thus:\nA = 20\n\nAfter combining the equations, we know now:\n\nR = 130 - A\n\nA = 2 * R\n\nH = (R + C) + 2\nC = H - 2\n\nSolve for R and C:\n\nR = H - C \n\nR - C = H -> C = H - R\n\nR = (H - R) + R\nR = 2R\n\nR = 20 -> H = 20\nC = 20 - R\nC = 10\n\nR = 5\n\nC = 15\n\nSo, Rick gave off 20 cards and kept only 5 of them. The 25 cards given away were not divided evenly between Miguel and Rick's sisters because 10 cards remained. Therefore 30/25 of the remaining cards went to Rick's sisters, or 3/5 of the total number of cards he gave away. That number of cards is 6 out of 25, which represents 30%.", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "Ans: The cost at the warehouse per can of sparkling water is $20.00 and the equivalent cost at the grocery stores is $12.0\n\n### Input\n\nThe sales and use tax for the entire U.S. has been established by our President, who, through the IRS, collects a flat rate from all sales of goods and services, which is then reimbursed back to each state where it was collected.  The President claims that this is the simplest sales tax ever instituted. He feels that it\u2019s more of an adjustment to the price of a good than the sales taxes most states collect.  The sales tax in each state, though, is not identical with any other state.  The sales and use tax in each state varies slightly, as do its income tax rates. What is the maximum percentage disparity in the sales tax rates among individual states?\n\n### Demostration:\n\nInput: The sales tax in Illinois is 9.25%.\n\nThe President claims that this is less than most states tax rates. This can also be expressed as sales tax in Illinois is $9.25 on every $100 purchase. \n\nThe Sales tax in Washington is 6.3%, which is also less than most states and can be expressed as $6.30 on every $10 purchase.\n\nSo the maximum variance in any one state sales tax rate would have to be less than Washington's tax rate of $6.30, which is $2.90 per $100 sale.\n\n### Questions:How much more can it be?\n\n### Input : The President claims that this new sales tax system is the most efficient ever instituted.

Therefore, when the pencil breaks into small pieces, the equation becomes zero=zero.  At the time the pencil comes to a stop, its rate of acceleration is zero.  When the pencil is falling, the speed is getting greater and its rate of acceleration\u200b is greater. But at the point when it slows and stops, the acceleration stops.  So, when it stops, the equation is zero=zero.\n\nAnswer: A pencil falling to the Earth's ground has zero acceleration until it hits the ground.  From that point, acceleration increases.  This means it will be traveling faster and faster until it has a collision with a harder surface it might be traveling through.\n\n### Input For Part B Of The Task:\n\"The person who made the pencil is the one who is going to answer that question.\"\nInput: The pencil is made with such quality that it doesn't break.  But when falling from a great height, it may break to save from the collision with a hard surface on the ground.  Conner can drop it and wait if he want.", "answer": " 58"}

{"text": "Input:  $20\nOutput:  $4.625\n\n### Example:\n$20 divided by $3.5 gives 5.714, but 5714%100 is 5.71, so you can round up and have $5.71. Next, multiply by.100, so 5.71 times 0.100 gives 0.571, and add the result to 4.625 and you get $4.6275, but 100 times [571-9] gives 5.7 or 5.7 dollars. Therefor, 57100 divided by 0.10 equals 570.9, giving you 570. That rounds up to 571, and 571 times 0 or 571 dollars. Next, 571 divided by.10 equals 53.5 and.10 times 53.5 is 5.35, add this to the original $.57 and you have $5.925. Rounding this to 5.71 you have $5.725. But, you were given 571, not 572, dollars. Also, since we want $ to be on the floor, we divide 53.5 times the ceiling of 2 (.535) and get.02875. Rounding this off you have $.63875. And again, since we want dollars, we will multiply by.10, which gives $0.06387. Add this to $5.72 and you are left with $5.787. Rounding this off gives $5.79. Lastly, we have $5.79 dollars.

She sells bags of granola for $6.0 per bag, making a profit of $3.00 per bag and grossing $60.00.  $60.0 in sales minus $58.0 in cost equals $2.0 in profit (15 bags sold x $6.0 per\nbag selling price)\n\n\n### Instructions:\n\nWrite a Ruby program that answers the question.  Provide unit tests; do the unit tests pass with the given input test data?\n\n### Detailed Response:\nIn order to properly process the question, I first defined variable\n$bags_sold.  I then wrote the total markup being $3.00 and the total cost of each granola being $3.0.\nI then used the variables given above to determine the total for all bags sold, but before any markdowns were applied.  To determine net profit, I subtracted $58.00 from the gross profit of $60.0.  The variable $total_profit represents the profit received after mark-down.\n\n\n### Reference:\nhttps://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-solve-coding-interview-math-questions-in-ruby/\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/questions/55305091/how-to-find-the-unit-test-suites-coverage-in-ruby-program", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": "Input:A rectangular flower bed in the city park is **4** meters wide. its length is **1** meter less than twice its diameter. The government wants to enforce the flower bed. How many **meters** of fence will be needed? answer: 15 m\n\n### Why we use a task based test?\n\nA task based test is an effective method to test a program. Tasks represent the real-world usage of the program. Therefore, in real life, it is natural to use a task to test the system's performance.\nThere are two different kinds of tasks in task based testing:\n\n#### Preconditions:\nPreconditions must be specified in a task. They are also called **assumptions**.The preconditions must be met by the system before doing the task.\n\n#### Postconditions:\nPre/postconditions usually are written in **if/else statements** in natural languages such as English, and the **assert statements** in C++, to validate the results produced by the system.\n\nIn C++, this kind of test is called a **unit test**.\n\nThe **assert statements** in postconditions look like this:\n\n```cpp\nassert(result == 123);\n```\n\n### What are some of the advantages of a task-based testing?\n\n- It is a very effective method to test large programs or systems.\n- It is easy to perform unit testing to verify the program's performance.\n- It reduces the possibility of writing test cases based on the system's internal implementation or logical structure.\n- The program does not have to be complete before testing (in the sense that the program may require a number of unimplemented functions).", "answer": " 22"}

Similarly, for any three-digit number, 999< 1000 is also divisible by $9$ without leaving a remainder:\n\n$1000=1\\cdot1000+(999+998+997+996+995)$\n\nSimilarly, for any three- digit number, 998<999 is also divisible by 9 without leaving remainder:\n\n$998=1\\cdot998+(997+907+$\n\nSimilarly for any three-digit numnber, 997<998 is also divisable by $9$ without remaining:\n\n$97=997+9=1006$\n\nWe can now notice that 900, 996, 995, 994, 993,", "answer": " 22"}

It is fun to snorkel off the sandbars. Some of the people do scuba but I prefer the snorkel because I can stay under water a lot longer with my snorkel I am not a strong swimmer. So I like to stay under water longer then stay at the surface of the water. I like to look at fish. It is a great place to swim. I love it there. There are tons of sharks but they are not that big and they do not eat humans but other fish.", "answer": " 54"}

There are two student named Maria and John. Maria can find the area of a 4-inch square. John can find the area of 5-inch square. They worked together to find the area of the smaller square.

I am going to write a program that will take in a list of words.  Each time the program will read the list of words it will be looking for the opposite of the word in the list.  This program will have the following logic: 1.)The program will be a while loop that will run whenever the end user will type in a word.  2.)For each time the program will take the word and compare it to the other word.  Each time the list of words will contain all three words  \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\", they must be in line with the rest of the program so the program will run each time it is restarted.  If the word is not the same as the other word the program will output the opposite letter for the word.  3.)The words in the list will go the next word.  If the current word is the opposite the program will return to step 1.  4.)After each word is completed the program will output a result that looks like this.  The words, \"A\", \"B, and \"C\" will be in line one of the output.  The word that represents the programmed code input will be in line 2.  For the first line we will place A, C, A, and this will move on.  Once the while loop is complete the output will list the entire list of \"A\", \"B\" and \"C\".", "answer": " 4"}

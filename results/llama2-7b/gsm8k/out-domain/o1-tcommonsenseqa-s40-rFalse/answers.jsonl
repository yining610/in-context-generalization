They had been soaking wet  so he wanted to get changed into something dry.  He put his old clothes in the wash immediately afterward.  He grabbed the jean suit he had worn the night before.  He had never worn that suit since it was such a tight fit around the  waist. The collar around his neck  was always too tight.  As a result, he had never been comfortable wearing it, because he could never tie up the collar the way he would normally like to.  He was also slightly relieved that he had not worn that suit  for he could never tie the top button in the top position.  There had never been a time where  the collar around his neck was just the right tightness.  It was just too tight  over his shoulders.  When he pulled it on without his old undershirt on,  he instantly understood what he had felt the entire day.  That top button could not be tied as tight as he would like to tie it.  That was too tight it hurt him. It was just a too tight  for him to wear the suit.  He tried to keep his mind off it as he walked to the lake  with all of them.  As soon as he had the suit on he knew he could feel  his collar getting a little sore around his neck.  He could now understand where his discomfort was coming from.  He did not  know why he kept his undershirts on with this suit all the time.  He never really understood how someone could tie one of these  suit tie things.  He was never comfortable with the way people tended to wear these suit ties.  They tied them up as tight as they possibly could and always  they were pulled so tight it made his collar sore to touch.   He would never be like that.  He would never tie his tie up as tight as these crazy suit  people.  In this way, his mind was still thinking of his collar soreness  his entire trip.\n\nOutput:D: 76/83 points\n\nInput:", "answer": " 30"}

Although we do not know the sex of the children the moment they are born, so this means they could have two different fathers, but if we take the probability of the father passing on the trait to the twins separately we can say that the probability of them having the same father is 2/3rds.\n---\n\n### Instruction:Answer one of these 2 questions.\n\nQuestion 1: Suppose we have 2000 identical 5-coin throws. (15 is the total expected value with one die). For each successive trial, toss a die and place into the bin any five-coin combination whose result is two or more heads. What is the probability that eventually all of the five-coin combinations are placed into the bin after some appropriate number of trials? Justify.\nOutput: A: 99.9%\n---\n\nQuestion 2: If you have 5 red and 5 black, if you flip two heads you get a tie. If you flip a head and a tail you do not get a tie. You are only allowed 1 flip. Then the conditional probability of the head/tail toss giving a tie (P(H/T)) is 0. How could you determine this.\nOutput: A) Let x=1, y=1. then 1x + y = 0 and x + y = 1 hence y = 1-x and x= 0,1+y= 1 so: y= 1-x, x= 0, 1+y=1 and y is the probability.\n\n---\n\n# Saving and Loading", "answer": " 41"}

Do you think students do better in elementary and middle school when studying for a grade? \n\n### Instructions: Please explain what happens in case 000, and briefly explain what you have done.\n\nAnswer: I use recursion here, and the base case of the function is when p = q, and the value is 1. Therefore, for every case of numbers that have not reached the number I am interested in, the resulting value is 1. When both p and q are less than the desired number, the resulting value is subtracted from the value of p and q. \nThis is the general approach from my book.\n\n\n### Instructon:Please explain code 000, in detail.\n\nAnswer: This is just a recursion, in which for each p and q, when q is greater than the number we are searching the value is returned as 1. Afterwards, we will compare the values, when q is bigger than p, and check if either value is greater than myLimit. When it's not, the two values are subtracted from each value and we check again. The value in the resulting variable, after the substraction, will continue to be our base case.\n\n\n## Instruction: What strategy will you use in testing these functions, and what type of mistakes does this method of testing detect?\n\nAnswer: I am using recursive function here, so it's best to check where I am using recursion. To make sure that there isn't an infinite recursion inside the function, I would use a depth-first search to find what is recursive.\n\nTo make sure the base and recursive cases don't contradict, I can test various situations in which it could possibly happen, and see what it does.\n\n\n##Instruction:Please write the code as you explain in case 001, and explain its effect.\n\n### Instutction:What is the base case of your function (i.e. what are the conditions where the recursive case does not need to occur)?\n\n### Instuction:Does the function always return the same value even for the same inputs?

Next, you are given a string line of M characters, where M is an integer ranging from 1 to 50. The characters in the string line are the names of the students in your class. The students can have any number of names (1-50), but each string line will have no more than 50 characters, and no more than one of the characters is an \"X\". After reading in the data, your task is to determine the number of different last names that are repeated in your class, where the names are case insensitive.  You can assume that every name is different. For example, students in class \"Gary, Frank, Bob\" will have just their first names repeated. But if some student is named, \"Frank II\", then it will be treated as \"Frank\" in this problem. \nOutput: D: 4\n\n\nInput:The average (arithmetic mean) of 4 numbers is 8.

Your task is to generate at most N strings, with no more than N distinct strings that \"belong\" to your system. Each string will contain less than 100 characters (with the exception that a blank character (\"\") can be the beginning or ending of a string).

{"text": "A:19.17 hours per day\n\nInput:Bill was driving in a large city when he spotted a street sign he had never seen: The street was dead ending while another street ran right into it. The intersection of the two streets was marked with a roundabout. Bill was uncertain how to get to his destination, as he had never seen a highway sign with arrows like the one he had spotted.  Bill decided to take the roundabout. He had never traveled a roundabout before, but he thought it would be easy since he had just seen a car, labeled \"Exit 11,\" go into the roundabout.  He was right.  It was easy to get into the roundabout. He, unfortunately, got lost in the roundabout after the road divided into two more roadways.  Finally, upon exiting the roundabout, he found himself back at his original intersection.  He figured it was time to backtrack to the street he had missed with his roundabout. But when he checked the map, he saw that an exit he wished to take was blocked by two other streets. He considered it too late to go back and decided to risk taking the exit anyway.   Bill was soon driving down a road that ran parallel to a railroad track.  He thought he heard something behind him, so he sped up to get ahead of it in case it was a train.  Bill knew that cars were supposed to slow behind trains for their safety.   Bill drove over an abandoned bridge on the road parallel to the railroad track.  Unfortunately, he didn't check to see if the bridge was out and crossed it, knowing the train would not pass directly beneath it.  But, to his horror, the train passed directly beneath him.  Luckily, he survived, despite having to ditch his car before the bridge was swept off the tracks.   Bill learned three important lessons about road sign markings.   The first was, as in this case, never follow \"the crowd.\"   The second was, although a 5-way roadway might appear to have 5 exits, sometimes only one of those exits is open.   And the third was, never believe an exit is free.  The road to the exit usually costs more than what you had planned to pay.\nOutput:The intersection was more difficult to navigate than he had expected. He had never used a roundabout before and", "answer": " 5"}

The hypervisor created an isolated operating system in which applications could run, while also permitting the hypervisor to access system memory and other components that they couldn't access on their own. If you don't know, then think \"Virtual\" in relation to this question. The computer engineer didn't consider that the hypervisor had a large memory footprint, and consequently, the hypervisor became congested. This made the applications on top of the operating system run slower. This is a problem commonly referred to as a hypervisor's \"gunslinger\"  function. The engineer's solution was to provide the hypervisor with the largest storage system they could find in order to compensate, which was effective...until it ran out of space. If the hypervisor crashed, the applications would go with it. They could either be manually recovered or the user would have to wait a considerable amount of time for them to restart. When a new version of the computer operating system was released that could perform the function internally, the hypervisor was no longer used, thereby solving the problem. What is being referred to in the question by the term \"gunsliger\" function?

Remember, inputs are values passed into your function.  They won't be used after the function has computated them, so you should make sure to declare those before the functions.  Outputs are values that you use to print out to the screen.  An input is like a number and an ouput is a variable like a string.  You'll be coding your input and output types to make sure they're matching.  You'll also be checking for type and value errors in your code to make sure it won't crash.

If a force acts on the umbrella, what happens to the net force acting on the umbrella? The umbrella doesn\u2019t care if other objects are hitting it, unless they take away force from its original force, the force on the umbrella is just equal to the weight of the object. If the umbrella is stuck between objects pressing it down, it would have a net force of zero, because 2 forces cancel out. How about a force from air?  If the air is pushing on the umbrella with a certain force and then something else also started hitting it at a different angle, then the net force on the umbrell will change. When the umbrella turns, wind is blowing it in different ways, but air is blowing down as well, causing the umbrella to have a force that is in line with the ground.]\n\nInput:F+800\nOutput:F:14000\n[Input:Rebecca is having her favorite hamburger at her favorite restaurant.

So, if one is interested in how many pound of coffee to order for six cups of coffee, one can divide six by three, get 2, multiply that by 1, get two pounds, and then add 1.  What is the procedure to determine the correct answer?\nOutput: There are a couple of ways to solve this.  A:  If one knows that $1.50 per pound of coffee, you can multiply 1.50 by six, which gives you $9, multiply that by 2, which gives you $18 which is the correct answer or B:  The other way is to divide 1.50/pound by how many one wants to divide that by, which in this case is six, to get $0.25 per cup.  But then you need to multiply that times six.  There are a couple of things that one can do to avoid the confusion.  You can put the $1.50 first and then multiply by the six, or you can put six first because that's how most coffee prices are quoted, or by multiplying $1.50 by 6.\n\nInput:  2 + 3 + 4 = 9\n\nOutput: 5\n\nInput: What is the value of (1 + 2 - 3) - 4 + (3 - 5) + 6?\n\nOutput: -730\n\nInput:  100 % of 5 is how many?\n\nOutput:  50%(?)", "answer": " 1100"}

Questions like your \"Why doesn't this code do X\" type questions should be very well suited to SO.\n\nQuestions about \"what I'm expected to know\" for a test should not be asked on SO. At the very minimum you should be a student, or be actively learning a language or tool, in which case you may consider one of our sister sites.\n\nLastly, questions about math-based programming questions are generally off topic on SO. It's okay to have a question about a mathematical algorithm and include the language or tool you are using to implement it, but the emphasis should still remain on the algorithm itself, not on the language or tool.

If you divide 6 by 6, you get 1. So, you cannot divide a number by anything that would result in a fraction. 26 can be divided by 3 without getting a fraction. So, the number will be 9.

The first rule that the town follows is that each type of pie is sold only in its associated bakery - no apple pies are sold at pumpkin bakeries, and no pumpkin pies are sold at apple bakeries. The second rule is that each customer buys only 1 pie. (A customer who wants to buy 2 pies has to go to a different bakery for the second pie, not the same bakery.)  (i.e. it is not possible for a customer to buy 1 each of apple and pumpkin pie). A customer going to one of the  large bakeries can get a pie which costs $2 and is either a pumpkin pie or an apple pie. A customer going to one the medium bakeries can get either a pumpkin or an apple pie, which costs $1. All pies from small bakeries cost $0.50.

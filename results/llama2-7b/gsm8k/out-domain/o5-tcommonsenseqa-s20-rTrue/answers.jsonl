Begin by reading through the question once to understand the information being asked.\n2. Keep in mind that the answer is Randy's overall population of trees, not just those specific trees. For example, if Randy sells 3 of those 65 mangoes and 2 of his 7 coconut tree, he still has 62 trees on his farm.\n3. We are given the number of mango trees on the farm and the number of coconuts as well as the equation used to find the total number of trees.\n4. For our example, if we assume that we are looking for the total number of farm trees, we know that the equation for figuring out the total number of trees on the farm is:\n\n 5 trees=5000+(9500-500)\n5. The given equation can be rewritten as:\n\ntrees=5*\n6. We are given that Randy has 65 trees on his farm, so plugging this number into the equation gives:\n\ntrees=65*(25)\n7. Now that we have the correct equation, we can substitute the given values in the original equation and simplify: \n   \n6*(25)=\n8. Once we solve for **x**, we get **x** = 25 + 25, or 50.

{"text": "11. This question is asking about the number of digits of pi memorized by \"Sam\" relative to \"Carlos\". \n2. In order to solve the question, we can use the information given in the question to determine the value of Sam's number of digits and then use that to compare the number of digits memories by Carlos or Mina.\n3. Let's start with option A, in which Sam memorized 17 digits. Comparing it to Carlos, Sam has memorized fewer digits, as Carlos memorized 11 more digits than the 17 that Sam memorized. \n4. Continuing, option B, in which Carlos memorized 12 digits. Comparing relative to Mina, Carlos memorized fewer than Mina, so Sam's 17 digits are fewer than Mina's. \n5. Moving on option C, in which Mina memorized 72 digits, which is more than any other option. Comparing relative to Sam, Carlos, and Mina, Carlos and Sam remembered less than Mina. \n6. Therefore, option B is the correct answer as it represents the case where Carlos, whose number of digits memorized is 12, is equivalent to Mina, whose number of digits is 72. As stated in the question, \"Sam's memorized six times as much as Carlos's memorized\" (so, 12 + 12 = 64 / 2 = 32). \n7. Finally, we arrive at the formula that Sam's number of memorized digits must be 32. \n8.

From this list, it's possible to make a total of 8 x 5 = 40, 9 x 5 = 55 and 10 x 5 = 100 trips altogether.\n6. Therefore the answer to the question lies somewhere between 40 and 100, as any values outside of this range are not possible within the given context \n7. The highest number in this range is the number E (27) which is 9x5 = 55 since the highest possible value for trips a bus is able to complete is 10 times 5 and this is the answer C (10) \n8. So the answer is between E (27) and C (10) which is between 27 and 13 which is rounded down to 10 because it's a smaller number of trips completed in a period of greater time (5 hours) \nSo the final result is 10 B: 27", "answer": " 96"}

There are multiple ways to write the equations 1. 2 \u00d7 10 + 3 \u00d7 15 + 4 \u00d7 9 + 2 \u00d7 18 = 240 \n2.     2 \u00d7  10 + 3   \u00d7 18 =  240 \n8. Finally, we see 3 \u00d7 18 =   54  3 \u00d7 15 =  46  3 \u00d7  9 =   27 The total is 3 + 54 + 46 + 27 = 140\n9. The 140 stars will fill a set of 4 bottles (60 stars each). 10. 4 \u00d7 60 = 3 \u00d7 240 = 4 \u00d7 140 \n11. Subtracting 4 from 60, we get 56. 12. 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 14 = 28 \n13. Putting all together  3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7  4 + 3 \u00d7  54 +  4 \u00d7   60 + 2 \u00d7  14 = 4 \u2013 28 \u2013 46 \u2013 30 =  3 \u00d7 140 \u2013 64 =    74 \n14.

{"text": "1: We can answer the question in two ways: first, consider the statement \"Trevor buys three bouquets\". \n2. Next, we can list each bouquet as a set of carnations. \n3. From the given information of 9 carnations, 14 carnation, and 13 carnation, we know the carnations are limited. \n4. From the total of 36 carnations in the final step, we can determine that carnations are limited by adding the carnations in the statement. 5. If bouquets are in the form of 9 or 13 carnatives, then carnations are the same regardless of the time and amount. 6. The sum of all the carnations of the three bouquets is 36. 7. The sum of the carnations sold is 36.\n8. So then the next step is to divide 26 between 3 or 19, and then multiply the result by 3 to get the answer.\n9. Or: 26 / [3 or 19] X 2 = answer.\n10.

Therefore, 1 is removed from the list of options. Likewise, 4 is not the correct answer since the number formed by adding 2 & 3 to 6 is 10 which is not divisible by 6 (10/6=1.6666667).\nNow we are left with 2 and 3. According to our analysis of the question, the \"correct\" answer should be the option which produces a number divisible by only 6 as opposed to 6+1 (23).\nThe correct answer is therefore 3 because it produces three as opposed to four. We can check this by doing 3+6=9 which is divisible by 3.\n\nInput:What are the colors in a rainbow?

{"text": "The answer is D:$9$ people\n1. Let's start by breaking down the given statement to find some key phrases and terms. First, Tina is getting $2 for each book, which will be used later. \n2. Next, if she realizes a $20 profit, that will be applied to the book sales - $20 x number of sales.\n3. Then consider all the terms used in the question: \"Every customer buys 2 books at a time, the customer buying those 2 books cost $5 a piece ($10 total), $20 is for every book sold.\"\n4. Also, \"she sells\" suggests that the process is ongoing, so to get the total number of books she's sold, keep tallying up the total books sold as she makes additional sales. \n5. Now let's see what the question is asking. It asks for 9 people because $120 represents the profit at 9 book sales.\n6. Then if those book sales cost $5 each, that means 9 people divided by 2 books each = 4.5 \n7. Then it says that every customer buys 3 books at a time, which means Tina has sold 28 books to 9 people. \n8. Finally, the profit of $120 divided by 28 is $4.3%. This means $20 for every book sold equals 9 books sold on average. \n9. Now we know what each of the phrases means and how they relate to each other, and the answer can be found. \n10. The given statement itself indicates that every person buys 2 books, and that each book costs $5.\n11. For this to equate to $120 of profit, each sale requires a profit of $6.6. \n12. However, the cost of each book was $5. So, for each sale, Tina pockets $1, and the customer leaves with 2 books in their hands. \n13. If Tina sells 9 books, she would have profited $10 for every sale. But this is not possible as her books cost $5. \n14. Therefore, the answer would be Tina sells just under 3 books for each set of two book purchases.", "answer": " 4"}

So now Elise has 30kg (25+5), if we keep adding 10kg bags, she will have a total of at least 40 (40+10) kg\n3. So she was already buying dog food when she purchased her 40 kg total, meaning they were not her first 40 kg purchased.\n4. This means she has already bought more than 40 kg of food!\n5. The only way to logically understand this is to assume that she was buying more than 40.5kg before and now she bought another 40.5+10 = 50.5kg\n6. So if she has 40.5 kgs of dog food, when she buys another 10kg, she will now have 50.5, the 0.5 kgs can be rounded down, but it doesn't matter if it goes up or down, as long as it goes past 40.5, we can say she has 40+50.5=91 kg. \nSo the final answer to the question is C: 91kg\n\nInput: We may also say that Elise has gone from having 40 kg to owning 50 kg of dog food.\nOutput: This means she was already owning 40kg of food before she purchased that other bag.\n6.

{"text": "1) First, note that the given statement is \"The student council sells...\" and this suggests an ongoing activity with a goal. \n2) Then, note what the question asks \"How much money will they make?\"\n3) This means we must analyze the context in which the erasers are being sold and determine how profitable they are.\n4) Further, consider what the purpose of the fundraiser is, as this will also affect profit margin. \n5) We can see that the erasers are sold to raise money for school dancers, which means they likely have a higher profit margin than selling a product purely for commercial or personal use.\n6) Thus, we have to consider the cost of the erasers and compare it with the selling price, in order to determine if the fundraiser is highly profitable. \n7) Looking at the answer options, we know that a student council raises money for a variety of different activities, such as school dances or field trips, but also that fundraisers can also be used to provide scholarships to deserving students or make needed upgrades to facilities.\n8) Thus, the options available are either for profit or non-profit purposes, which we know does not match the context of the given statement as it does not discuss any school dances or field trip being organized.\n9) Additionally, A - 20% (D) appears unrealistic as the average eraser profits per sale is a difficult figure to determine.\n10) On further analysis, we find out that the local bookstore is donating erasers to the student council. \n11) This indicates the erasers are not purchased with a markup in mind, but rather to help support the council's fundraising efforts.\n12) Thus, the options with a profit motive, B -100% (E) and C - 5% are incorrect as they are aimed at profit and not charity. \n13) D - 20% is also incorrect as the profit margin is unrealistically high. \n14) E - $0 is also incorrect as the total amount earned per sale would never be $0.\n15) So the answer is D - 20%.\nSo the final answer choice is D: 20%", "answer": " 864"}

Y=2X where X is the total pounds of berries picked on day n (n=0=Monday, 1=Tuesday, 2=Wednesday, 3=Thursday). \n22)Substituting the values for day 0 (Monday), Y=2*8. Y=16. Since Y does not end with a zero, we need to add an extra pound, bringing the total to Y=17.\n3)Now we can substitute the values for day 1 (Tuesday). The total pounds of berries on Tuesday was 9x3=27. Hence Y=27 on day 1. This is already more than enough for Steve to reach his goal of $100 on day 4, so we won't need Steve to pick berries on Wednesday. We can skip to day 3 (Thursday).\n4) Now we can substitute the values again, Y=27+17 (the previous day's harvest).

After the accident, with Mike not being able to use his right hand for writing/typing for a while, the amount of work Mike will be able to do is reduced by 20%.

The options to the question can range between 100% and 0%, as they are the total amounts of red and green caps in Ali's inventory and therefore represent the 2 possible results of an inventory. \n3. Calculating the probabilities of the options is: \n3.1 P(green caps amount = 50) = 0.5 => the probability that the amount is 50; \n3.2 P(total green caps amount + total red caps amount = 125) = 1 => the probability that the number of caps is equal to 125; \n3.3 P(red caps amount!= green caps amount) = 1 \n4. For calculation purposes, let's consider total number of green caps as variable \"X\" with its value as the given 50. \n4.1 P(X=50) = 1 / (1 + P(X \u2260 50)) = 1 / ( 1 + 0.5) = 2/3 \n5.

The question provides a time frame of 3 hours and in addition, the total number and rate of apples picked during the 1st hour, and the rate of picking increase for the 2nd and 3rd hours. \n3. Looking at what the question tells us, we can divide the statement into 3 parts - before 1st hour, 2nd hour and 3rd hour.\n4. We will try to combine them into an expression as follows: \"x*(x*(m*m*m+m+m)/m)\", where x is the first hour's picking rate, m is the second hour's picking rates, and m is the third hour's picking rte. \n5. The given picking rates before each hour are: 1st hour: 66 apples per hour, 2nd Hour: 131.5 apples per hour, and 3rd hour: 46.3 apples per hour. \n6.

This means we're looking for a solution that ensures each student has a desk available to them, but not necessarily the only desk available to them. \n2- To begin, it is important to recall the given numbers: 15 classrooms and an equal number of desks per classroom (15 classrooms x 15 desks per class = 225 desks total). \n3- There is also no mention of whether different classes use the same desks, so we can assume that each class has its own set of desks. \n4- We can divide the total number of desks (225 desks) by the number of classrooms (15 classrooms) which results in a ratio of 15:1. This is the amount of desks per class and shows that each class is accommodated for by 15 desks. \n5- One-third of these desks have 30 desk spaces, which means that each classroom with 30 desks can accommodate 5 students (because there are 40 students total in that classroom). \n6- The other classrooms have 25 desk per classroom, so the amount of students that these classrooms can accommodate is 8 (because there are 30 total students in a class with 25 desks). \n7- We know that there is 5 classes that can have students with 30 desk each, leaving 8 classes that can have students 25 desk each. \n8- These classrooms together have 280 desks, so there are 280 - 225 = 55 students that these 8 classrooms can accommodate. \n9- Therefore, the answer is 55 students.\nSo the final Answer is 5.5 Students", "answer": " 400"}

Choice A: The problem says that Randy has $104 when he went to the store but that the question we are asked to answer is to calculate how much money in dollars he started off with.\n7. Choice A is not the correct choice to calculate the initial amount of money because it ends with how much money Randy had in his piggy banks after one year, not how much money he had to start with.\n8. Choice B: The question asks how much money he had with him when he went to the grocery stores.\n9. Choice B also is not the correct answer for determining the initial value of the money.\n10. Choice C: The answer is $46 with $58 left.\n11. This was chosen simply because the given information at the end of the paragraph about him spending $2 dollars every time he went to the grocer's and making four trips every month was to see how much money he had left in his pig for the whole year.\n12.

Moving forward, we want to determine how much John spent while making the purchase. \n5. The process of solving the problem may seem intimidating with the addition of dollar signs attached to numbers, so it's helpful to convert the dollar amounts to a different base to visualize the relationship between the two.  \n6. Dividing 20 by 15%, we find that the base-10 ratio of each pin being sold after a 15% discount is $65.5.\n7. Then, multiplying the number of pins bought, which is 1 pins, by the price divided by the sale cost, we find that:  \n$65.5 x 1= $65.5\n8. Adding the base-10 amounts of the pins bought, we find that $65.5 + 65.5= $131.00\n9. In a problem statement, it's helpful to add the base-10 values of the inputs to find the base-10 answers. \n10.

The overall cost should be $79, which would be exactly calculated as the cost of 4 different plants, each should be (5 * 149) $79, which gives the required number of plants to be (14 * 79) $1126.\n2. However, the overall sum must be below $79.\n3. Now, we can find the number of plants within this range.\nUsing the given information in the problem: cost = $81, total number of plants for four different plants = 104\nUsing the provided expression, we get (a * 1 * b) = (104 * (104 - 81))\nSolving this expression we get a = 4 and b =13, however we have already determined (a, b) which is $80, and $79.

There are three cats, each with different meowing rates; the first meows three times per minute, the second meows twice as fast as the first, and the third meows one-third as much as the second. \n3. With these values in place, we can now create an equation to describe the time each cat takes to meow using a factor of (minute -1) \n4. It should be noted that the first cat meows three times per a minute and thus (3/60) = 1/20 = 0.05 \n5. The same calculation for the second cat is (x - half of that value because the second cat meows twice as fast, thus x = 4x/2 = 2x) = 4/30 = 1/10 = 0.1 (note: 4x/2= x(1/2)).\n6. For the third cat, x = (1/x) because the third cat meows one-third the fast as the second cat, thus x = 1/2 x = 1/4 now to combine all the equations to get one total expression:\n(1 + 2x + 3x + 4x)min = 20 + 20x + 3x x + 4x x ( 5 minutes) = 5x = (20 + 4x)x = 60x x = (60 + 4x)/10 = 64/10 = 6.4 7.

Then, for 8 times she uses the elevator, which is 2 hours, and she uses the elevator for 2 hours in total but also uses it for other times as well.  That's 4 hours.  Therefore, out of the 8 times that she's actually walking up the stairs (not including going to and from the elevator), there are 4 hours, which is half of a day.

Consider two possible number of hours John volunteers over the course of a year: (a) 36 hours - 2 times 18 [3 hours at a month twice per month]. (b) 4 hours per month [as he volunteers 2 times for 3 hours each month].\n4. The number of hours John volunteered over the course of a month is 4. The question asks how many hours he volunteers in a year. \n5. We need to find the number of months within a year to find out the number of hours John volunteer in a year. 12 months are there in a year and 2 times 12 = 24 in a year.\n6. As we know John volunteer twice each month, 24 - 2 * 18 = 2 hours.\n7.

{"text": "1. Start by understanding the basic structure of the question. \n2. In the given statement: 40% of church members are adults. It's important to note that 40% of members is not equivalent to the number of adults in a church. \n3. Similarly, understanding: The rest are children. It's not the other way around: \"The rest are adults\". \n4. Given the statement: 120 members, we know that 48 of them are adults, but the statement does not say how many of the remaining 72 members are adults and how many are children. \n5. Therefore, we understand the answer will be an unknown number representing the difference of children from adults. \n6. Since adults represent 48, it is safe to assume children represent the remaining 64 members. \n7. Then, using basic mathematics: Children are 64 members. Adults are 48 members. 40 of the remaining members are adults. Children represent 64 less adults. 64-40=24 120 members = 48 + 24 = 72 members. \n8. As there are 72 members in total in the church, since 48 of them (representing adults) are fewer than 72, then 64 (representing children) members are more, so the correct option is B: Twenty Four.\nSo the final answers are: 48 + 64 = 72 48 + 120 = 168 64 - 48 = 24", "answer": " 24"}

Therefore, we can use the following formula to solve the problem:\n4x - 2x2 + 3x3 - 4x4 +... + 2x5 = 4(5)(30) \n4x - 5x2 + 35x3 - 60x4 +... + x5 = x5(30) * 5 - x5(4)\n4x - x2 - 35x3 + 60x4 - x5 = x5 * 5 - x * 4 \n4x2 - 4x2 + 4x2 - 352x2 + 602x2 + 16x - x5 = 4x5\n24x5 - 46x2 + 440 = 4x5 30x5 + 308 = x5 60x2 + 182 = x5 \nx * = 16 \nx = 16\n5x = 4\nAnd therefore, as specified, the winner of the lotto receives $30. \nSo the final answer was 30.\n\nInput:How much is 25% of $200?

Choosing option E, the answer would be UTC, this is correct, since UTC doesn't change to fit any time zone.\n4. We are left with 4 remaining options, so we need to examine their correctness in regards to London time.\n5. Since option C states that \"GMT is the standard time used in London, England\", it is incorrect.\n6. B and A can't be correct, since London is in England, and England is in UK.\n7.

Rick has already eaten five servings, so there are fourteen servings left over which contain 110\u00d714=1540 Calories\n3. We add the five servings previously eaten by Rick which means there are 16 servings remaining in the 16 serving block of Cheese. The blocks are assumed to come with 16 servings by default.\n4. Therefore, Rick must have eaten five servings and there are 16 more servings left on the block so there must be 21 servings in all.\n5.

{"text": "1, the given question describes a roadwork company paving a newly constructed road of 16 miles, using a mixture of pitch and tar in the pavement.\n2. We know that each truckload contains two bags of graff, and five times as many barrels of tar relative to how many bags we use.\n3. That means that each truckload of tar uses 12 bags of gravel but 25 barrels of tar.\n4. Similarly the roadwork company needs 3 truckloads to pave a mile of road which means they will need 1 truckload of tar for every 3 truckloads of asphal which contain approximately 3 bags of gravel.\n5. We further know that it took 3 truckloads per mile for the first 4 miles, then 2 truckloads of tar per for the 5th mile, which means for the third and final mile, it will take 2 truckloads per mile.\n6. To answer the question we now need to solve 25 barrel of tar needed for the remaining road. We know that we will need 3 truckloads for each mile in the remaining mile and the roadwork company only uses 1 truckload to complete a mile. We use similar logic of reasoning to reach the solution, 12 bags and 5 truckloads of graff and tar is only needed to complete the remaining road.\n7.

{"text": "1.A store owner adds 80% of a wholesale price when setting the retail price.\n2. This means that the retail price is calculated by taking the wholesale price, and adding 80% of it.\n3. As such, we need to find the wholesale price given the retail price, and then calculate 80% of that value to determine the correct answer.\n4. The retail price for a pair of pants in this question is $36, allowing us to use the formula: (Wholesale Price + 0.8 * Retail Price)\n5. First, we determine the wholesale price by subtracting 20% for the retail markup ($36 -.2 * $36)\n6. Then we find that the mark-up is 80%, so multiply the $20.8 mark-up ($36 -.08 * $36) by 80% using the formula: 0.8 * (Wholesale price + 20.8)\n7. Next, take the $36 retail price, add the mark-up of $20,8 to get $58.8\n8. The final step is to divide the $58.8 total price by two to get $29.4, which is close to the actual answer of $29.\n9. Hence, the answer to this problem is $29.\nSo the final ans is $29\n\nInput: A student who receives a C- average in two consecutive courses will pass a statistics class.

The answer choices are E: 30% D: 40% B: 26.5% A: 40% C: 5.3% 6.  We can calculate the percentage chance of Aniie skidding given that the temperature is 8 degree outside to be 26. 7.  This can be done by multiplying the percentage chance of skidding - 30% and percentage chance of regaining control - 40%. 8. Since 30% is multiplied by 40%, and 40% is 40%, the answer - (2*(30*40) = 2*(1200)) is 4800. 9. As 40% of this is 1920, subtract the latter (A2=1920), giving us 2880. 10.  As Annie has a 3% chance of skidding if the current temperature is 32 degrees below freezing (B1=0.03), multiply B by the skid chance when 32 degrees below (B2=0.03*3) giving us 27. 11. Then, divide the resulting 112 by the percentage chance of skid (26) multiplied by the remaining 8 degree (2680), which is 13. 12.

{"text": "1st method - Add the values of 'display' and 'fridge'. This way we get the answer which is 5 cheesecakes.\n2nd method - The display is only 1-10. However, the fridge contains 15-25. This approach yields 45 which includes only the cheesecakes. This clearly is wrong as 25 belongs outside the scope. So the answer is 5 cheesacakes.\n3rd method - Use the concept of \"If and Only If\". If the baker has 17 (15 + 2) cheesecakes, then 2 from the fridge can also be sold. Therefore, it can be said that the baker has 20 cheesecakes: 15 from the fridge and 5 from the display. This is a similar approach to the first method.\n4th method - Remove 7 from the display and 7 from the fridge. We arrive at 15 from the display and 8 from the fridge. By this we can easily derive the answer as 18.\n5th method - The fridge is 15 - 7= 8. If we consider the display as 7+ 3 = 10, then 10-7=3 which belongs outside the scope. This way we can determine that we will use 5 from the display and from the fridge we can take 8. This also brings the result as 18.

{"text": "1) First, let's begin by understanding the variables in the problem. \nQuinton brought 4O cupcakes to school, \nHe gave a cupcake each to 18 students in Mrs. Delmont's Class, He also gave a cup cake each to 16 students in Mr. Donnelly' s class. He also gave cupcake to M. Delmont, M.

We need to count how many cupcakes he gave away. 40+18+16+4+4+1+6+4=100 so cupcakes he gave is 100. Now we have 30 cupcakes remaining in his pocket.5) The number of cupcakes remaining(30) is also divisible with '64' 64-30=14.So 14 are left in his box.

{"text": "1) Start by adding up all the hours worked by Olivia, which is 12.\n2) Next, multiply each hour worked by the $9/hour wage.

Since $9 x 3 = $27 and $9 x 4 =$36. These can be combined into $9x 3 + 9x4 = $9x7 = $63. This is how 9 x 3 + 9 x 4 = 63. The reason why 9 x 7 = 63 is that, like any other multiplication, you carry the units along. This 63 can be written in the form 9 x 7/7 where the fractions divide 7 evenly. Since we don't have a remainder, 9 + 7 / 7 is just 63.\n\nInput: There are plenty of books in the library, where can those be found?

{"text": "1.To answer this question, first work out how much each shirt and a pair of jean are worth in total. \n2.A shirt's cost is $10 so it is worth at least $10 to the customer. \n3.Similarly, a pair of jeans $20 so it's worth the minimum of $20 in total to the customer. 4.Now, add all the product prices together to calculate the total worth of all the goods available in the store. \n5. So there are $20 worth of shirts and $20 worth of jeans, making a total worth of $40. Next, multiply each product price with the quantity they were sold to find the total value of each item. 6.For example, for shirts, $20 x 20 = $400. 7.The same is observed for jeans as $20 x 10 = $200. So finally, we have total worth of products as $600. \n8.Then, divide these two totals by the total number of product to get the store profit. 9.There are 30 shirts bought by customers and 20 pairs of jeans bought by customers. \n10. So, the profit earned by the clothing store is $600 : 30 + 600 : 80 = $225. \nSo the final answer to this question is $225.\n\nInput:Where were the items used?

Taking one more option away from S, 2S - 2P = 4S.\n2. Half the number of P and S, and add them, which will give us the number of M. We're not using this information in the calculation at this point in time.\n3. 2 times the number M is greater than the number S, which means that at minimum, 2M is greater than 2S, or 2M - 2S = 6M.\n4. 8P - 3 times the number E is bigger than zero, meaning there are at least 8P - 6M = 2P excess parrots in the zoo.\n5.

Now that we know these pieces of data, we can use them to calculate at least one of the unknowns, namely the number of Monkeys, which is 2M.\n7.

{"text": "1.\"The goal of the question is to obtain the total number of pounds of sand that the three girls collect in their sandbox.\n2. To answer the question, one must first understand the terms and symbols used in the question.\nIn this case, we need to understand which option is which of the girls.\nAs a result, let's denote options as follows:\nE: Eden\nM: Mary\nI: Iris\n\n3. We also need to understand that each bucket contains 2 lbs of sand, so if E carried 4 buckets, it would imply 8 lbs of sand in total.\n4. Next, since Mary carried 1 extra bucket to Eden, she would be carrying 5 buckets in total, which means 10 lbs in total.\n5. Iris, since she carried 1 less bucket than Mary, she would be carrying only 4 buckets, making it 8 lbs in total. It is important to note that the total of the girls' sand is still 8 lbs regardless of whom they are, as they will all end up in the same sandbox. \n6. So, the total quantity of sand in buckets carried by the three girls is found to be (M+I)+E=15 lbs or 8+8+8. \n7. Finally, we take the total pounds of sand we have, which is 15 lbs, and divide it by each bucket which contains two pounds, to get 2 (15/2) = 7.5. This means that they each carry 7.5 lbs of sand in their bag.\n8.

At the second step, we are given three known quantities which are $10, a quarter of that money he has left and also the ice cream. \n3. Randy has $30 left after spending $10 and $1/4 = $.25. \n4. We know from the question that $10 + $.25 = $10.25, and that $10 + $10.2 = $20.25. Therefore, we can substitute for each of those values. With these known figures, we can solve: $30 - $10 - $.25 = 0.50, which means that Randy had $30 - $9 - $.25 left.

These variables are M, Margaux, D, the amount of money lent to each acquaintance, and N, the number of acquaintances, being 3 in this case.\n2. Next, identify the relationships between the given variables to determine which will be used in the calculations. The key relationship to note is that the total amount owed to MARGAUX (M, Margaux) is equal to the sum of three Ds added over seven days.\n3. The total amount of money owned to MARGAUX after seven days equals the sum of 5, 8 and 4 multiplied by seven days.\n4. Now, we must combine this information to answer the question. The total amount of MARGAUX's money owed by the three acquaintances is $37 by day 7.\n5. The total amount of owed money equals the sum of 37 and 2 by day 7. And then 37 and 3 by day 7.And then 37, 4 and 7 by day 7 and so on and so on until day 3.\n6. $37 X 3 = $111 for three days (total of three acquaintances and their owed money). \n7. $37 X3 + $37 X4 + $37X5 + $37X6 + $37X7 = 941\n8. $941 + $428 + $185 + $73 + $21 + $4 = $1726\n9.

The key information in this question is that there are 80 percent more flowers of the colour purple. We can use this information to find the total number.\n\n3. Let X = the total number.\n4. There are 10 yellow flowers for every yellow flower that is planted and 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. To find X, we need to understand the total number of yellow flowers in the garden.\n5. We can say there are 80 purple flowers in the garden for every yellow flower, and 10 yellow flowers are planted in the garden.\n6. To find the total number of yellow and purple flowers, we can use an equation 80P + 10Y = X.\n7. Therefore, X = 80P +10Y.\n8. We know P represents the total number of purple flowers.\n9. This means that X = 80 *P + 10.\n10. We can also say that X = P + 10. If X represents the  number of flowers in the garden, then P represents the number of purple flowers in the  garden and 10 represents the number of yellow flowers in  the garden.\n\n11. We can multiply P with 80 and then add 10 to it, which means  X = 80*P -10. We also  know that we are dealing with percents. So, 100*(80*P - 10) would be the answer to the question.\n\n12.

But it says \"She used one-half of the 10 kgs of butter to make chocolate chip cookies.\" In the very next statement, it says one-fifth of the butter was use to make peanut butter butter.

Choices: 1. 6th graders 2. 2nd graders 3. 8th graders 4. 5th graders 5. 1st graders\nOutput: 1.) We know the 7th graders are returning to their desks so, they noticed something was missing. 2.) We know when they notice their grades are missing on their math worksheets, the only students in the classroom are the 7th graded students (not their teacher nor other school personnel). 3.) We know of the 5 different grade levels in the classroom, the 1st graders had the least people and had just used the room for their class so, it is unlikely they were responsible for erasing the worksheet grades. 4.) We know the lowest amount of grade levels in the math classroom room together was the 6th graders. It is unlikely that the one grade level is the most likely responsible since other graders have a smaller number of students and could erase the grades but 6th graders are most likely not the least likely cause. 5.)

{"text": "There are several ways to approach this question. However, the most efficient approach would be to first determine the average number of skipping per round completed by both Sam and Jeff, then use this value for all calculations.\nThe easiest way to calculate this value is to subtract the number of skips each person has done in each round. We subtract the number instead of subtracting from the total, as it's easier to calculate.\nFor example, for the first round, we subtract the number of skipping Sam has completed from the total, giving us Sam's average is 1. We also need to calculate Jeff's average for the first round as he did more skipping than Sam. We find Jeff's average by subtracting the number of skipping he did from the total. That gives us that Jeff's average is 2.5.\nSubtracting the average value for the first round from the first round gives us that the the average number of skippings per round is Sam's average which is 1 + Jeff's average which is also 2.5 = 4\n\nRepeating this process for all 4 rounds gives the average of the total number of skips in the first round + second round + third round = Jeff's average = 16\n\nAs Jeff skipped half as many times as Sam in the last set of rounds, this meant that Jeff's total number of skips = half of Sam's total number of skip = (15+16).5 = 15.5\n\nSubtracting Jeff's number of total skip = 15.75 from 16 gives us that the answer is 0.25.\nHence the final answer is B :0.25\n\nInput: In the story \"Pinocchio\", a carpenter with a wooden nose is trying to get him to be more honest.

Understand the Question\nThe first important step is to read and understand the question exactly. You need to understand the exact phrase, wording, and meaning of the question before you answer it. If you get the question wrong from the start, it might take more time and energy to identify the correct answer. In this step, we are determining whether to divide or multiply, the number of hours that the workers have worked, and the capacity of the truck (6000).\n\n2. Understand What the Question is Asking\nThe question states that Stella, and Twinkle are each adding 250 blocks of stone blocks per hour into the truck. It does not mention how long each person has worked for. To answer this question we need to identify the number of people, the duration, and the rate of how many stone blocks each person is adding to the truck. We can use the given information to find the number of hours it took the workers to fill the truck.\n\n3. Consider the Possible Answers\nIt says that four people joined the others, then they are eight people. For each hour, Stella would be adding 250 stones blocks and Twinkle is adding 250 also, therefore there are 500 stone blocks being added to the truck per hour. The total number of stone blocks that have been added per hour is 1,200. With Stella and Twinkle being given 4 hours each, so it would take 4 hours in total for them to fill the truck completely. We can then conclude that the truck was fill for 4 hours.\n\n4. Identify the Correct Answer", "answer": " 6"}

In this case, the question is - \" There are 40 students and if 1/10 of them are absent, then what percentage of the students that are present in the classroom are in the classroom and how many are in the canteen.\" \n\nAnalysis: 6. We know that there are a total of 40 students in this class, and 1/10, or 10/100, students as absent.  7. Therefore, we can write the equation - (1/10) * 40  = 80, which means that 80% of the students are present. 8. Since we know that 3/4 of these students who are present are inside the classroom, we can rewrite the equation to 9. 3/4 * 80 = 64  10. Thus, we can conclude that there is 64 students in the classroom. 11. The rest 80 \u2013 64 = 16, which is then further expressed as 1/4 of the students, and 16/4 = 4.  \n12. Finally, we know that the rest of these 40 students are not in the classroom, so the equation we were left with is 13. 80 \u2013 4 = 76; 3/4 * (80 \u2013 4) = 76 - 1/4 * (86 - 4) =74 \n14. Thus, the answer to the previous question in the statement is that 74 students are in the cante and remaining 26 are outside. \nSo the final answer 74 students are inside the canteen; 26 students are walking around 8.\n\nInput: If three times a number is decreased by seven, the answer is increased by 26, what is the number?\nOutput: \nHere's the question:If three times a number is increased by seven, what it the number?Now we can", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "1) The solution is simple if you follow these steps:\n\n2) 1. Write down the problem, read each instruction a couple of times to make sure you understand what you're doing: \"3 families of 4 share a rental for 7days, and each person uses 1 oversize beach towel daily before getting a new one.\"\n\n3) 2. Think about what you can easily substitute when you read the problem, and the answer is almost directly tied to the answer. So, what do you have that you know you can substitute, that is to say, something which has a direct connection to the answer in the instruction? So, there are people involved, there are beaches involved, and since the subject of the exercise is 'to wash...', water is also involved, towels have to be washed with it, the math problem is involved since towels have to hold water. So, you're going to be counting them, and then calculating how many loads of laundries are going to be needed in order to wash a total of how many towels? Well, 3 families multiplied by 4 people equals 12 people, so in order to wash just one load, you have to wash 4 pieces, right! So the first question is how many towels are needed every day? Well, each family has to use a towel a day, and there are 12 people counting for the families, so if each member of a family uses 1 towel, then in order to wash that 1 towel, the 14 times oversize towels can hold, you're going 14 towels, right? Ok, so in order to get this 4 times on a daily basis, then you're going to need how many pieces every day? Well, there are 12 families, so you're going to use 14, because the 14 oversize can hold 4 pieces of clothes, so you're gonna wash 4 loads a day or in other words 4 loads a day. It will take 14 pieces every single day, 9,000 pieces for the week, 63,000 pieces every week multiplied to 7, and that means in total 451,000 pieces. Or in other words,", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "1. First read the question.\n2. Transform into a math-friendly format: \"Larry spends half (0.5) an hour twice a day (2) walking and playing with his (dog)\".\n3. Now we have 0.5 + 2 + the dog term. \n4. We multiply by minutes because this is the unit this question wants.\n5. We get (0.5) * 2 * dog.\n6. To find the time spent playing and walking (PW), we just subtract half from dog. \n7. Then (PW) + dog = total dog spend. \n8. (1/5) is the fraction of the total. \n9. Total is 2dog, so total / 5 is 2dog.\n10. Total dog spend = 2dog + 1/5 = 2 * 2 / 5 + 1/5.\n11.

{"text": "1. Write down the whole statement: The 6 people (let us call them X, Y, Z, A, B, C) gathered a total of 400 eggs in their first round of Easter egg hunting. Tank and Emma gathered 10 more eggs than the other 6 people. The second round had a total of 60 eggs being collected by Emma, and the remaining eggs (let us call them D) were collected evenly by the other 5 people.\n2. Understanding how the sentences relate to each other is vital to answering this question.\n3. As per question, Tank and Emma gathered a total of 10 more eggs. In fact, all 6 hunted together and therefore Emma and Tank together gathered 560 eggs, and therefore 490 eggs were gathered by the other 5 (X, Y, Z, B, C).\n4. That means 10 more eggs were gathered (in total 60 more eggs) by Emma and Tank, this means (10*210) = (10*5) + (10*60).\n5. In the question it is assumed that Tank and Emma will add all the 60/5 eggs gathered by the six friends, and thus their total is 100+60 =160 in their second round.\n6. The remaining question is, if total eggs that the 6 people gathered was 400 then 160+400 =460 in both rounds.\n7. Therefore, question is asking for the final number of eggs in both rounds. \n8. So the total number of eggs gathered by Emma in both rounds was 160+160 = 320 (as there were two rounds.)\n9. Now, the final number of eggs that the other 6 people gathered in the second round was calculated as follows: 400*4=1600.\n10. So the final answer to the above question is: 320+1600 = 1920.\nSo the final number of eggs gathered by the other 6 people was 1920 (400+160).\n\nInput: What is the value of 20 + ( 5 / 5 )?

{"text": "1) The input begins \"Bob was creating a math...\"  and describes creating a test consisting of Math questions\n2) This suggests Bob is using a certain approach to the task at hand which involves increasing the number of questions at intervals. \n3) The input mentions Bob doing this for 3 hours. \n4) The output requirement is the number of questions Bob was able to create, so this question has only one solution, as Bob created the number of questions indicated by the input. \n5) To calculate the number of questions, we will take each hour separately and multiply the number of questions Bob created each hour to obtain the total number of questions after 3 hours are up. \n6) First of all, since his rate was doubled in the 2nd hour, the number of questions Bob made in the 1st and 2nd hours cannot be equal.  Thus, we can ignore the question asked about the first hour and focus on the second and third hours.\n7) For the second hour of work, Bob doubled his rate (2X), producing 13 more questions.  We can write this as 2X = 13.\n8) For the next hour, Bob doubled the 2X rate.  We know Bob doubled his rate for his 2nd hour, but it's not clear whether the doubled rate was from the 1st hour or the 2nd hour (thus leading to the 1st and/or 2nd hour being doubled). \n9) From the doubled rate, Bob was then able to produce 26 questions.  This is also written with 2X = 26. \n10) We now obtain the sum of the values from multiplying 2X and 2X: 2X * 2X = (2X)^2 = 25X. \n11) When multiplied together over 3 hours, the result is 86X. \n12) When we obtain the final result, the question has stated that Bob created 13 questions 1st hour, 13 questions 2nd hour, 26 questions 3rd hour, and 86 questions in total over 3 hours.  There is no solution except for the suggested one. \n13) Therefore, Bob created 86 questions in 3 hours.\nSo the", "answer": " 91"}
{"text": "1) Let's take an easy approach by looking at the number of doughnuts that Samuel and Cathy bought. \n2) Both bought 24 and 18 doughnuts respectively. \n3) Since they want to share the doughnut equally among the 8 other friends, each friend needs to get 3 doughnuts from them. \n4) If that's the case, then, the number of doughnut that each of them get is (3*8) or 24 doughnuts. \n5) We could have also taken the \"number of doughnut\" which Samuel bought as our starting point and then take care of the other 18 doughnut which Cathy bought. The difference in the \"number of doughtnut\" which Samuel bought is 2 (24 - 22). We also know that the difference to be shared among the friends is (2*18) which gives us 36. The difference can't be divided equally between all friends, so each of them had to get their individual share of (36 mod 8) or (4) doughnuts. And likewise with Cathy's left out doughnut, we start with the remaining 18 doughnant which she bought and then we have to share difference(18 mod 8) or 2 doughnuts. This completes the answer with 24 + 4 + 2 = 30 doughnuts. Therefore, the answer 30 doughnut.\nSo the final Answer is 30 doughnant.", "answer": " 6"}

There are 4 people in total, each of them takes 30 minutes to collect 35 pounds of wood, the three people including Kimberley, Ela, Houston, and the fourth can be omitted. So in the end, the three of them can collect 35pounds of fire in 30 minutes. \n5-The number of people available is limited, so the amount collected is 15pounds.\n6-The number of members available is not limited because collecting 15pounds is only 22% of 70pounds, and the time required can be calculated from the previous section.\n7-When determining the number of members available, underestimation is most effective, since 12pounds is only 0.17pounds, and the collection time is 12 minutes, if we assume that the collection time is three times faster than others, we can get 4 members instead of 3 members to complete the task.

Ryan can't have more green balls than he has total balls. \n3: Options B and C both have the correct number of green balls if options are consistent. If there was twice as many red balls and 8 times as many red balls as green balls, then there would be 168 total balls.\n4: In other words, if there are 11 times as many red balls and there are 11 red balls, then there would only be 17 red balls, or there would be 19 red balls if there were twice as many red balls.\n5: We also need to know how many balls Ryan has total because we know that red balls and green balls are the same, so the first part will give us the total number of balls. \n6: This tells us that Ryan has 4,000 balls total, which is a good enough approximation even if we're wrong by a few. \n7: To find the total number of balls, multiply the number of green balls by 2 and subtract by the total number of balls to get the total number of green balls. \n8: Green + blue balls = 2 * green balls \u2013 total balls. \n9: 400 * 2 = 800 \u2013 4000 = 1400. \n10: Therefore, Ryan has 1400 green balls. \n11: To find the total amount of green balls, green balls + blue balls = 140. \n12: 140 = 14 + blue balls. \n13: blue balls = 126. \n14: Therefore, Ryan has a total of 126 blue balls. \nSo the final answer for Ryan's green balls is 1400 and the final answer for Ryan blue balls is 126.", "answer": " 7"}

A large painting is usually 40x60 cm in size, while a small painting is usually about half that size, at 20x30 cm. \n4) Based on the prices provided, if we assume that all the paintings were small, then Michael would earn $100 * 16 paintings = 1600. If we assume all the paintings were large, then we would earn $400 + 6400 = 6800. \n5) Taking into account the ratio of large to small paintings sold, Michael sold 5 * 40 = 200 large paintings and 2 * 8 = 16 of small paintings. \n6) Combining the information we have, we see that if there were 1600 paintings in total, we would have generated $1600 of revenue.

And then John trains another 4 days for the 15 push-ups. Now we know that if it takes 5 days then he adds 2 days for the push-ups then we can replace the 5 with 3 days and then we get the total of 4.6 weeks.  And the final day he will be doing floor push-ups should be 11th day from his starting date.  Now the question is the day the John starts?  I assume it is a Saturday, because from the given 7 clues if we sum them then they equal to 11.  So the starting day is Saturday.  But If the starting time is not Saturday then replace it in the total of 4 weeks with the rest(5-1), then John will be able to complete the 4 weeks in 5 weeks and his starting date will be the 26th of  the month.

We also need to know if that's for a weekday week, that is 5x times Monday to Friday, or a weekend week, which is on Saturday and Sunday.\n4. In this case, we have asked how many containers of milk one buys in three weeks' time.\n5. We can understand that 2 containers are bought every school day for l(t) = 3 school days in 1 week.\n6. So, in one week 2(6) containers of milk are bought. Thus 2x containers of milk are bought in one week.\n7. Similarly, in one weekend, since there is no school, Emma does not buy any milk.\n8. Hence 0x containers of milk are brought in one weekend.\n9. Therefore in 3 weeks there are a total of (2x)(w + 3(1x)) containers of milk bought.\n10. However, since there is no milk purchase on weekends, we subtract 0x = zero from the denominator, giving 2x(w + 3x) containers of milk bought. \n11. Since we are dividing by 3 as many containers bought in three weeks, we get  2x(w +  3x)/3, which further simplify to 2x(6w + 18x)/3 \n12. But remember these are weekly quantities, thus w = 7.

{"text": "1.Begin by understanding the question. Note the given information and the calculations that need to be done to find the answer. \n2.Start by understanding the question. \n3. First, determine the actual question. In this case it's: 'How much money does Mr. Caiden have to pay for the remaining roofing?' Knowing this, there are several ways we can solve this question, by calculating the total cost before the discount, the actual cost after the discount and subtracting these to find how much money needed to pay for the remaining 70 feet of roofing.\n4. Next, calculate Mr. Caiden's actual costs by taking total price of the 300 feet roofing multiplied by the number of feet he received, which is 250. Then, subtract this amount from the amount he paid, which is 8\u00d7300. This gives us 2400 less 8\u00d730 = 8\u00d730-2400 (rounded to 1400-240). \n5. Mr. Caiden then received 250 feet, which means he has to pay for 55 feet of metal roofing, leaving him with 295 feet of the 30 foot of metal roofing. \n6. To calculate the cost of this metal roofing, multiply the given price of metal roofing. This gives us 8\u00d755=460.\n7.The final calculation to calculate the amount for the remaining metal roof is (460-1400).\nSo the final answer to the question is: Mr. Caiden needs to pay $920 for the remaining metal roof, after taking the discount into consideration.", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "1) Take note of the given conditions and instructions.\n2) Begin by figuring out the total amount of money Isabel had as the given statement starts off with her having some money in her pigg bank.\n3) Since Isabel spent half the entire amount she had, her remaining amount would be $51.\n4) Since Isabel then proceeded to spend half of what is remainder, we know she has another remaining amount of $25.50.\n5) Thus, we can conclude Isabel started with: Total amount of money: $51. Remaining money: $0 Half the remaining money is $25.5. Second remaining money is $26.\n6) The statement also says that Isabel spent half of the entire amount she had to buy her brother a book. \n7) This means she started with $51. After spending $26 for her brother's book she now has $25 left and her brother has $0.50.\n8) Therefore, if Isabel spent half of the remaining amount she has left, there is a remaining amount of $12.50. The second remaining amount is: her brother with $0.50 and she with $12.5.\n9) Adding all the remaining amounts together, we get: Total amount of money (originally) = $51 Remaining money = $0 Half of the total amount remaining (after spending $25 from original) = $25.5 Additional $12.5 after spending $5 for brother = $12.5 + $12.5 = $25 (since Isabel had $5 left originally) Additional $26 for brother = $26 Total amount remaining (after speding $51) = $25 + $12 + $26 = $63.5\n10) Finally, Isabel has $63.5 at the end.\n11) If she has $57.5 at the end, subtract $57.5 from Total in steps 8 and 9, since she would now have less money.

To figure out how much 1.5 ounce of coffee would cost, multiply 1.5 with the cost of 1 ounce of coffee. 1 ounce of a standard coffee bean costs approximately $0.10.\n9. So, 14 multiplied by $0.10 would give us a total of $1.40.\n10. We know a bag of coffee costs $5 and each bag holds 10.5ounces of coffee. 14 cups of coffee would equal to 0.82 bags of coffee.\n11.

{"text": "1 First, let's clear up any confusing points in the problem that may lead to a wrong solution.\n2. For example, this section is confusing. \"She splits the profit in two\" means she doesn't actually have $480 in a safe account, rather it means that she has $960 in total to spend, but in order to get the amount needed for her next shipment, she has to \"use\" the whole $960 and \"split the \"profit\"' (i.e. $480) in half.\n3. Also notice that after \"she splits the profit in one-half\", we are asked, \"She received a total donation\" and the next words \"from her family and friends\u201d.\n4. This suggests that all the money she earns that is \"donated\" is her family and friends' portion of the profit. \n5. It also says, \"How much money did she make\". The money she made from her donations is not her profit, but only her overall total.\n6. For this reason we should replace the question \"How much money did \nshe make? with \"How much money she had left in the end and used for her next shipment?\"\n7. We do this because we will have to divide $960 by the $310 received to find $650 as our target figure.\n8. Having understood our interpretation better, we can solve the question.\n9. We see that the amount in the money pot \"in the end\" is $650.\n10. Therefore, \"How much she had left in the middle\" is $65/2= $32, and \"How much she needed to pay for her next\nshipment\" is \"650-$32= $618\", which is the same amount she received in donations from her friends and family.\n11.

Now, the part of the given question that needs to be answered is the \"1 day\" which means the one day they were working each day for 8 hours in total. So, for 1 day multiply 8 times each number which you have written in the column labeled 8 earlier that is the number of customers served for each person.\n5. Now that you have each number for every person, multiply each of those numbers and the amount you got by adding all the previously written number of customers served on a particular day as shown in the solution below. \n6. Now, do the same for Julia, she worked only 6 hours so you have to multiply 6 hours by the number of customers served by her during a 8 hour's day.\n7. So multiply 8 times the number written in the second column labeled \"8\" which represents the number of customers served in a 8 hour day, then add it to the first solution.\n8. This gives the answer as 33\nSo the final answer to the question is 33.", "answer": " 154"}
{"text": "1, The first we need to understand about the question is that it is asking us for how much money Tom should spend.\n2, To solve the question we should first see what 50% off a dollar is, then think about why he should have to pay full price for the other half, and then ask himself how much the half would cost him.\n3, We have found that 50% off equal.50 dollars, so he would have to spend 2 dollars on half of the bricks. How many bricks will this cover him in order to build the shed?\n4, To find out you could say bricks for.50 = 200 bricks, and then you have 100 of those left to obtain. Now you can take 200 + 500 = 700 total dollars spent on the bricks. However, you know the other half will cost you the same amount as you use on the first half which you need 1000 total bricks.\n5, Now think back to the dollar you were given of 50% off. 0.5 is half so take half of the 700 or 70 dollars back.\n6, Now you know total 630 dollars you need to spend in the end.\n7, You should use the fact that you have 2 dollars off half and realize you could just use 39 out of the first 50 and leave the other 37 for the second half.\n8, If you multiply the 630 by.39 you get 239, which you can then take 100% off.50 and obtain 950 dollars as a total cost in the end.\n9, Tom should spend 630 dollars or 950 dollars depending on if you include or don't include the 239 as a rounding error or not.\n10, Therefore, the answer is b. 630.

To do this we are going to subtract 3 bags of coals (60) from 15 (15 + 3 bags) the answer is 12, which would equal to the total number of coalis used at any given time after the 3 bags were done being used by the grilling. 9. After multiplying the final number with the number of minutes, we get the final answer to the question which in this case would be 10.5 hours because (900 / 12 = 75 minutes / 2 minutes = 37.5 / 2 = 18.75, 18.7 / by removing the decimal becomes 19).\n\nInput:Is there a place where a fireplace is used at night?

To calculate this, we need 3 things: the amount of water, the amount of salt, and the weight of salt.\n3. To find out how much salt there is we know that if the water is 2% salt, then 20% of it is also 2% of the water, or 40g. \n4. This is how much salt there will be in the water. 5.

They are also better for some sorting algorithms like insertion based sorting.\n-A binary tree is more flexible (the key is how you define what is a node and what is a branch or node)\n-Both data structures use pointers, in a binary tree the nodes can point to other nodes in the tree and can be traversed but in a linked list they are just the addresses of other nodes.\n\n\n### Binary search tree \n\n-A linked list can only contain one data item per node. \n-Binary search tree on the other hand uses the nodes to contain a sorted integer or a node pointer which then contains more nodes. \n-binary search tree", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "1. Start by analyzing the question to understand what is being asked. \n2. The initial question we see is \"Emery and Serena visit their school library, each borrows a copy...\". \n3. Then the question asks for \"the average number of days the pair \"take\"... to read the book\".\n4. There are two things we need to get out of this sentence first  - how many books the pair borrowed and what happened to them after they took them. \n5. Starting with the first part of the sentence, we have:  \"(Emery and Serena) each borrow a copy (of Steve's book) to read for their school (project).\"\n6. Since the number of books the pair borrowed is not limited, it must be unspecified. \n7. Hence, we can replace the numbers in the sentence with a variable, so the statement becomes \"(Emery and Serene each borrow a copy of the book) to read for the project\".\n8. We can now assume that the books borrowed by both of them are the same.\n\n9. The variable in the remaining portion of the sentence, \"their school project\", refers to reading the books. \n10. Therefore, the given sentence can be restated as \"Emery and Serene both borrow a copy of the same book, each to read for their school's project\".\n\n11. So, we know the pair of books contains the same book to be read by the pair.\n12. Then we can look at the last part of the sentence \"each borrow a copy\" and conclude that the borrowed books are identical. \n13. To understand what happened to the books once they were borrowed,  we assume one of the books to be borrowed is numbered 1 and the other is numbered 2.  \n14. This means book number 1 is borrowed by Emery and book number 2 is borrowed by Serena. \n15. If we then consider each book is read by an individual, we are able to read the sentence as: \"Emery borrows book number 1 to read, and Serena borrows book number 2 to read.\"\n\n16. In this situation, it would make sense to say that books 1 and 2 are the same because they have the same content that Serena and Em", "answer": " 60"}

The total wages and tax Janet pays for her six workers is given by the formula: (6 * $15/hour) + (2 * $20/hour) + $240.00 $260.00. In this problem, we are given the amount that is spent on employee wages (the $260. The $240. 00 of wages that Janet pays managers are known.) and the taxes that Janet must pay. 3) From what is given, determine what needs to be solved in order to obtain the formula. The total wages paid to the four warehouse workers and the salaries of the two managers. $15 * 4 + $20 * 2 = $260. 00 $269.00.

{"text": "This question is asking how many more gallons of milk must Flora drink to meet the 3 gallons daily required by her doctor. \n1. Since her brother believes she'll need to drink more, the answer to the problem must be greater than 3 gallons per day. \n2. If her brother believes she doesn't need to drink that much, then we can conclude she has a sufficient quantity but not the minimum Dr. Juan wants her to drink. \n3. Therefore, more milk will have to be consumed to meet the daily recommended amount. \n4. Assuming 16 ounces in 1 gallon and 2.2 lbs. in 1 gal of milk, the number of gallons would be multiplied by 8 to convert the number of ounces to gallons, i.e. 24*8 = 200 ounces per gallon. \n5. The original requirement of 105 gallon was divided by 200 (due to the number of gallon being the only unit of measurement which is accepted) and 3 to account for the daily consumption, thus resulting in the 4 gallon per day addition to her daily consumption. \n6. Therefore, Dr. Juan's recommendation can not be provided because the quantity is less than the 12 gallons of milk required. \nSo therefore the correct answer to the question: Flora has to drink 4 more gallons of milk to consume the 105 gallonsof milk recommended by her doctor daily.", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "1) Let X represent the combined weight of Stan and Steve. X is 7X + 16 for Steve + Steve + the excess weight from Stan of 5 pounds (which we are assuming they stand together).\n2) Stan weighs 5 pounds, Steve weighs 8 pounds. From (1) above, we can put the excess weight in the scale due to stan into stan at 5 + 5.\n3) Thus, X represents how much Steve weighs and X + 110 represents Jim.\n4) We need one number to represent the combined weight of these three. Using one number, or constant X, means X has to be changed into a fraction. Doing this gives \nX / (X + 110) \n5) Weighing the scale twice with Steve, Jim, and Stan weighing separately will give \n(5 + 110 + 260) / (75 + 575 + 260).\n6) Divide both denominators by 75 to get 1 + 350 / 80\n7) Divide both numerators by 100 and get 7 / 4 + 26 / 4. \n8) Subtract 26 / 100 from the latter and get 350 /100.\n9) Plug the values into a calculator and we get 350/100 = 3.5\n10) Rounding it to the nearest integer we see X/X+110 = 2X - 16 + 10.\n11) Therefore the total mass of the three of them is 2x - 16 +10 + 100 which equals 365.5 pounds.\nSo the final solution is 365.\n\nInput: How do the numbers of animals in their local library compare to how many were captured in a net?

Let us put this in an equation:\nY-X=1600-X\n8) This gives us a quadratic:\nY-X ^2 = 14600-X^2\n9) We can use the formula for the first and second derivative of a quadratic(derivative of sq. root of (A+B*x) is (A/2*sqrt(A+B*x))^2+(B/2*sqrt(x-A+B*x^2))*x) for solving any quadratic function.\n10) In our case, we have X^2 instead of X, so we can use formula of derivative of sq. root of X^2= X sq. root(X^2-x*X)+X with x replaced by -a/2 (in our case X=Y-X, so we want to solve the function X sq. root(a^2-X*a)+a for X)\n11) So putting all of this together, we get X=398.670013, i.e. the smaller house is being expanded by 398.6 sq. ft.\nSo the final solution turns out to be 398.7", "answer": " 3500"}

When Jack started to say those cards were valued at $5 each and the scammer asked if he could still bring them back, he knew he had fooled the scammer and hung up.\nAs the scammer needed to find 10 codes, it makes sense that he only went with 2 codes for $200 gift cards. So the scammer was trying to get a total of 9 x $200 = $1800. However, if he had 2 $500 codes, only 9 x $250 = $2250 would be his total.

We can only assume Haruto has 0 tomato in his house. So, there is no need to add any number of tomato before taking the half as given in the question.  \nii) Hence, for multiplication and division rule, we can only apply these 2 rules only when Haruto has the tomato plants in his house. There is no sense in applying multiplication and division rule, when there is no tomato in his house to start with.  \niii) Therefore, first thing we have to do is to add the number of tomato plant or multiply with 0. It is always better to assume the number to be 0 and start with. Once you give them, then the value is calculated to be given in the final answer. For example, if question is \"How many 5s did John get in a game of cards?\" You can always start from 0.

{"text": "1) Use the following formula to calculate the answer to the given question: $$ \\frac{\\text{Sum of Money Shared}}{\\text{Total Number of People Sharing Money}} = \\frac{\\text{Individual Amount}}{\\text{Others Receiving Amounts}} $$ Sam shared a sum of money among 3 cousins, Sandra, Amy and Amanda each with a 2, 1, and 3 ratio, respectively. \n2) First, identify the given variables. Here, they are the sum of the money, the number of people to share it, and the amount each person receives. \n3) Starting with the first equation, we get that Sam's sum of the money is $140. \n4) Next, we need to find the number of people who are sharing the $140. If there are 3 people, then the total number of people is $140 divided by 3, which gives us 46 which is the total number of persons splitting the money. \n5) Now, looking at the second part, we know Sandra, Amy and Ruby received the sum of the money with Sandra and Amanda receiving 50 each, and Amy getting 20. \n6) Here, we have to determine how much Sandra received, and we know from the first equation that $140 was split into 46 pieces. \n7) We can then substitute 46 into the ratio and get that Sandra received 30, as all the three received the same fraction. \n8) Therefore, the answer we are seeking is $30 each which can be interpreted as a 60% increase on the initial sum of $140.\nSo the final amount was $30 each.\n\nInput:The train was running late, so why was John not surprised?

However, if C and D each feeds 14 birds per cup, this would mean that, over seven days, the bird feeder would be feeding 84 birds per day. This is not reasonable since Ivan would not be able to sustain such a large population of birds in his yard. Therefore, C (Difference in the last 2 numbers of each choice in C: 17, D: 14).  6. Furthermore, since birds require a constant supply of food and habitat, feeding 84 hungry birds per day would not be a sustainable practice. Thus, we can eliminate C and D, as they are inappropriate options for this scenario. 7. Finally, considering B (number of the first option minus the second option B: 4): Ivan's bird fees a maximum of 4 birds a day, which is much more reasonable than the 84 birds suggested by C and D. This means that the correct answer is 4. \n8. Therefore, the answer must be B: 4.\nSo the final answers is B: 4\n\nInput: The children were having a birthday party and so decided to buy a balloon to help celebrate.

{"text": "The given question asks how much Donna would pay if she bought the porcelain and paid 10 percent sales tax. \n1. We know that the porcelain vases was originally priced at 200, which means that it was originally two hundred dollars. \n2. We also know that the vase went on sale and the discount was thirty percent. \n3. Therefore, the vase then sold for 40 dollars. \n4. Let's consider Donna's purchase of the porcelain vass with a ten percent sales tax being charged. \n5. Firstly, the sale, which is the vase being sold at a 40% discount, and a ten percent sales tax of forty dollars, means that she paid 80 dollars for the vase. \n6. Then, using 80 dollars as the base value we can begin to solve this question. Consider that Dona's 80 dollars payment could be represented as 0.8 and that her original 200 dollar amount could be represented as 2.\n7. So, then we know that the total payment on the vase was 3 dollars more than the original payment. \n8. Consider that the original and the reduced price payment could be 2x1.2 and 2x0.8. \n9. Then plug 0.8 into the original payment. 0.8 times 2 equals 1.6 and we then subtract 0.8 from 2 leaving 1.2 dollars. \n10. Therefore, we arrive an our answer that our payment for the vase was (0.8 + 0.2) = 1.2 dollars more than our original sales payment. \nSo the final answer to Donna's question is that she paid 81.2 dollars.\n\nOutput: Here's a breakdown of how the problem is solved: 1. Start by identifying the key information in the given problem. This includes the two vases, the starting and ending price, and the discount offered. Also the tax as well. 2. List out each step as the problem is being completed. 3. Begin by calculating the difference between the two starting prices using the discount, and the sales tax to find the final sale price. 4.

The given information - the old refrigerator costs $0.85/day and the new refrigerator costs only $0.45/day-  provides us with values $0.85 and $0.45.\n3. Using either of those values (let's call them values_a and values_b) we can build expressions:\n```\nKurt's savings = values_a - values_b (or value_a + value_b) - value_b (same thing!) \n```\n4. Starting with $0.85, we can write it as:\n```\nKUrts_savings = 0.85 (or KUrts_saving = 0.84)\n```\n5. To get the correct answer, we need values_b, the cost of the new refrigeratore, so:\n```\nKURT's savings = $0.85 - $0.45 \n```\n6. Then we substitute values_b in that equation:\n```\nKurts_savings=(0.85-0.45) \n```\n7. We are looking for KURT's savig, so we just have to extract and find the KURT's.\n8.

Now, 2/1=2/5 is all of the quaters we have.\nThe quaters are divided into 35 as follows:\n\n 35/26= (1/1) + (1/2) + (4/5) + (5/12)\n\n1/2 = 3/12 = 1/4\n4/5 = 8/20 = 1/2\n5/12 = 2/6 = 1/3\n35/26 = (1/1)  + (1/2 ) + (1/3) + (1/4)\n\nSo, we have 26pennsylvanian quaters and 26 non-pennsylvanian quaters as well.\nSince the total number of quaters is 26, this means that the total of the 26 states quaters is also 26. The two numbers can then be plugged into the following equation:\n 35= (1/1)+ (1/2)+(4/5)+(1/3) +26 = (1+1 + 4 + 1)* 26  \n          (1+1 +1 1)*26 =19 \n         25 +26=41\n         25=41-26\n         9 = 41", "answer": " 7"}

Given that the store offers 20% off towels, if we take that 20% discount on Bailey's total towel spending, we get 80% and this amounts to $960.\n7. She needs a total of 18 towels.\n8. Therefore, she can afford a total of 12 sets and still have money left for one set towel.\n9. After the 12 sets of Master bathroom, the total price after the discount is $460 (600 x 80% = 480, and 480 - 12 = 460).\n10.

However, there are two important assumptions - the number of wooden statuess is fixed and Theodore earns a commission for each stone statue. \n4. Therefore, the answer would be the sum of the production costs.\n5. The answer is to subtract the costs of each statue from the total earnings per month and then divide the answer by two as there are only half as many stones as there are wooden statues. \n6.

Considering Choice D: If we subtract Djibo's age now from his sister's, it adds to 122 years. This means Djibo and his sister have 122 years combined and the sister has been 122 - 18=104 years old.\n3. Consider choice E. Djibo's and sister's combined age is 5+17=22. This means Djibos' sister is 22 - 9.6 = 12.4 and Djibo is 22 -18.4=3.6 years older. His sister should be 36 years old. So, the answer should be option E.\nSo the answer is E.", "answer": " 28"}
{"text": "Input:How many squares can 10 inches form? Choices: 0, 4, 1, 5, 3, 10, 6\nOutput:1.This question asks about the number of squares that a specific length (10 inches) can make.\n2.A square has 4 sides of equal length and length is in turn measured in inches which suggests our squares are 4 inches on a side.\n3.Hence 4 can be multiplied or divided by 10 to reveal the following choices: 0, 5, 4, 2, 10, and 6.\n4.0 is not a valid answer as it would imply that the 10 inches of dough would be insufficient to create any squares at all when divided in half.\n\n5.As 0 and 2 are not valid answers, options with a remainder of 0 or 2 are eliminated.\n\n6.In other words, the only three valid answers left are: 5, 4 and 10\n\n7.Our goal is to determine which is the actual answer, so we will break down the other answers and see if they contain any common patterns and if so which one is the most likely option.\n\n8.We see the answer in the options is 4 which is the most popular answer because it shows the greatest mathematical commonality between the other options.\n\n9.We see the other options are derived from it with a pattern of: 4,2, and then 4 again\n\n10.There is no option available that is divided by 2. Hence, the most logical option with the mathematical commonality is the chosen answer.\n\nNote:The number 5 is not commonly used in the math problem. It's only used as an input to the math problem.\nSo there is no \"most likely option\" to choose from.\n\nSo the final answer here is: 4", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "1.To proceed, note the phrase \"as many as\". \"As many as\" suggests that the numbers being described can't be expressed simply by adding the units.\n2.When multiplying by 4, the phrase \"as many\" is preserved as Ryan's party was 26% as many as would be if 4x Ryan's party were combined with Taylor's birthday.\n3.Noting that Ryan's had 35 people, Taylor's had 40, and 240 combined, we can solve this problem by dividing the solution by the expression 4:\n4.If Ryan's party is 26% the same as 4x Ryan't, then 4x Ryan' would have 26% of Ryan's party size, which was 35 people.\n5.Solving this expression yields that Ryan's party would have 13 x 4, for 52 people.\n6.Therefore, Ryan's party is equivalent to 26% of 4x Ryan', which would be 4x (13) = 52 people. \n7.\"As many as\" is maintained in that Taylor's birthday had 20% more people than Ryan's party.\n8.Finally, combining Taylor's with Ryan's 20% larger party would give 240 people. \n9.Therefore, Ryan had a party 52/240 = 21% as large as Taylor's birthdays.\n10.Therefore, the answer is D.\nSo the final answers is D\n\n\nInput:What is the difference between a lorry and a truck?

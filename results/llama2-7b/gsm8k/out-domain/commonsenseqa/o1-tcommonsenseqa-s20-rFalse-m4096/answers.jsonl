For example, consider the right triangle to the right. If we know that all three sides have a length of 2ft, then we could use a standard right triangle formula to find the value of x.\n\n$$x=\\frac{h^2}{l}$$ or $$x=\\frac{\\sqrt{(h+2ft+4ft)^2}}{2ft+4ft}$$ or $$x=\\sqrt{h^2+40ft^2+48ft^2}$$\n\nAs you can see, this does not work. The method of triangles will fail here and you would go outside the realm of the Pythagorean Theorem, and end up as a negative result, since 2ft+4ft is not positive.\n\nInstead, the quadratic formula needs to be used. To do so, you treat the area of the triangle as a function of the two sides, x and y.\n\n$y=\\sqrt{x^2+h^2+48}\\sim x y-y+ hx = 0$\n\nSolving this equation for y will result in the answer to the question. Specifically, this is done by finding both the roots of the function $y=\\sqrt{x(x-h)+48}$ and plugging these in to the original question.\n\nOutput:In the figure, x is ___ and y is ___\n\nInput: The answer is **A** in the figure, x is 50, and y is -35.\n\n\n\n# I really like the way this instructor teach and answer our question and I would like", "answer": " 258"}

They decided to meet on different streets and meet at a caf\u00e9 before the show. Ed and Frank met at Main Street and Ed suggested the caf\u00e9, the Cockroach.  Jack and Sue met at 8th Street and agreed to eat at the Sea Food Palace while Sue agreed to walk over with Jack to meet everybody after the play.  The Sea Food Palace was in sight of the Caf\u00e9 but was on a different street.  She decided to skip the dinner with Jack at the palace and walk with him to the Caf\u00e9 Cockroach with the others. \n\nOn the other hand, Jack walked in the city and reached the Main Street 3 minute\nlater and met with Eddy.  They both walked for 12 minutes to the Caf\u00e9 Cockerall.\n\nThey both met Sue and Frank who were 20 minutes earlier.  They decided that\nthey will meet all and walk towards the play. There were 10 minute ahead to the entrance of the play.

There are two people in the room: one speaks in years, counting for every day, while the other speaks in months, counting 4 for every month. One of them is older of age and is the older speaker, while the other is younger of age and is called the younger speaker. This younger speaker knows exactly one month ahead of time when it gets to the next itineration. But how long will it take for the old man to tell everything that was said? \nOutput:E: 50 days\nThe solution is based on the fact that the last sentence of the puzzle mentions that the old man (who cannot say a month more quickly than the young man - which he has to do 9 times) needs to remember everything, but he must be able to guess a date where there is a next iternation and then guess what is said.\n\nHe thus needs to know that the current month's name comes in the middle of the two sentences that will be spoken, and thus has to wait for the correct position. Once knowing the position in which the old sentence will end, he must then determine whether that month's speech will contain a 4 or not, and if so, then how many 4\u2019s does it contain, otherwise, how many 3\u2019s.\n\nThis is necessary until he gets to the position of the next iternation, and must then subtract 9 so that the current date is not counted twice, and guess what is said. This method will ensure that on the tenth day the old man hears something new for the first time (the iternations were spaced in weeks, and therefore on day 10 there will not be any new sentence - he has just been told all for the first time.)\n\nInput: A farmer has three pigs that can eat up to 1,2, and 3 pigs of", "answer": " 37"}

In a week, the store sold 75 cookies. One way\n\nto calculate how many cookies each kind was purchased is to count how many times a customer purchased each cookies. For instance, counting how many times a customer\n\npurchased the butterscotch cookie, the customer purchased 9 cookies of this type. We say that there was a purchase of 1 butterscotch, and so this quantity is 1. Another way to\n\nrepresent the purchase of butterscotch cookies as is to say that there was a price of 9 butterscotch per one purchase.

For example, you can't write \"175\" in the form of 2 x 87 because in the end you get \"200\", not \"175\".\n\nHowever, there are languages of the world that support such a conversion. For those languages, we can convert one number to a different one by multiplying the input by the conversion factor.\n\nThe problem is that sometimes, our input will have more than one such conversion factor. For example, take the language that treats numbers in the form of 100a as 10b, where b is the number you get when you subtract 100 from a.\n\nThen, when you multiply both sides by 10, the conversion factor is 100.\n\nYour challenge is:\nWrite a function to get the conversion factor by first calculating the multiplications and then finding the smallest one. Return an object (or array) that includes the conversion factor along with the numbers you calculated.\n\nInput: \nThe number that you're converting: 220\nYour output should be an object that has a property \"factor\". That property should contain the conversion factor, (80). Your output should also have another property \"answer\" that contains the result of the conversion, (17).\n\n#", "answer": " 52"}

A declarative sentence either commands or states.

A clause is called the verb \"can\" and \"walk\" and it does not contain both a subject and a predicate. \"Mary can walk\" would be a complete sentence.\n\nInstead of this sentence, you could try using an interrogative sentence. For an interrogative sentence, you ask a question. Example: \"Can Jared walk?\" \n\nInput:There are many types of sentences:", "answer": " 12"}

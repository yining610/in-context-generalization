The question is a riddle.\n* A riddle is a puzzle or a conundrum, in which a question is asked (that is a poser), with a hidden answer which is to be revealed.\n* The answer is called the punchline. In most cases, the riddle is constructed as an analogy, using the comparison: this thing is that thing.\n* **Tips:** Try to remember the answer should be the last word of the riddle.\n```\ne.g. \"What comes once in a minute twice in a century?\" Answer: Millenium.\n```\n* **The solution to a riddle does not mean it is necessarily right, or it is necessarily wrong.**\n\n### Instruction:\n- Choose any riddle question which you like, but not too hard and not too easy. Just moderate.\n- Write a function in Javascript which find the answer and return the answer to the riddle.\n- If the answer not present, return empty string.\n##\n\n\n\n#\n## Instruction:\nThe function name should be riddle. The answer for that specific riddle should be inside the function. The function should be a function with parameters but no return statements, since we are going to calculate the time using recursion.\n### My Answer\n\nconst riddle = (input) => { /* A function with parameters but no value return */\n\n\nif(answers[input]){\nreturn answers[input]\n} else {\n    return (input * input) / 2.0 // calculate the mid of time\n}\n}\n\n```\ne.\n```\n##\n# RULE\n1.

C) Only one\nOutput: All the given numbers are even\n\nQuestion:\nWhat does the question ask us to do? Answer:\nFind as many patterns and regularities as we can to determine whether the rule in the problem is valid or not.\nWhat is the method? Answer:\nWrite a program that inputs the numbers 10, 20, 30, etc (1 to 100 in any order) and then prints the total if all these numbers are in order. If there is no pattern, the program should print 1.\nInput:Enter the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\nOutput:63\n\nWhat does the number represent in your program? Answer:\nWhen the program encounters numbers, it adds them together. 6 + 3 = 63.\n\nExplanation:The numbers 1 through 10 have to be taken in any order, but we can still find a pattern: 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 32. We do not have to go beyond 7, but we can still deduce a pattern from this: 5 + 4 + 3 = 12. We keep going like this: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. We can write this pattern as: 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11 + 13 = 46. We need to print the number, not the pattern, but we can print a number with a 2 added: 46 + 2 = 48.

Then you must make John put potatos one by one to the bag (e.g. put one after one) **note**: the machine cannot pick potatos or put potato.\n\nThen you will let John read the number from bag to you and count by the machine. When the bag is empty, the machine will tell you how many potatos are left.\n\nYou will let the machine count the potatos from the last bag, to a certain bag you can imagine (e.g. from bag 3 to bag 1).

One inequality being the `a` and `d`, while the other being `b` and `d`. \n    \n    From here onward, we will be looking at the problem independently from both sides. \n    \n    First, we will work on the problem `a-b < c`, that is, `a < 1+b`. From this we can see that `0<b` so that `b` is negative as it is in the left hand side. \n    \n       ![image](https: https://user-images.ziox-store.com/d1181a62-9b7c-4c91-98f9-49f4698455fd_436.png)\n    \t\n    So we have `a < b`. Since the only options for the variable `a` are integers, then the solution would be 1.\n   \n    We are left with another inequality, which is `d>=b` as shown below.\n    \n       !

The entire system has an amount of internal energy. If the rate of heat output is increased, how does the input rate have to be increased to keep the temperature constant?\nOutput:  Answers A, B, and D are wrong.  We are given a thermal system at constant temperature, but the time period is not specified.  If we assume the rate of heat output can be varied, then we can keep the temperature constant by varying the input, but it does not matter.  If we have some time period, then we can also keep the temperature constant by adjusting the input to compensate for the change in time period. Choosing the input rate of heat to compensate for the time period is the same thing as adjusting the time period to compensate for the input rate of heat. The rate of heat output cannot determine the input rate of heat, or vice-versa.\n\nA bucket contains five different kinds of water. Each kind of water tastes different.

When all 64 moves are exercised, either the opponent\u2019s king was captured by their King, or the King is still alive in the board. If a players king is still alive in the 64 move game, then the players score is the higher of the two player scores. If their King wins, then the score is +10. If there players King\u2019s are dead by the time it was 64 moves that they must kill their opponent, then the score is either player\u2019s 3rd or 7th move. If a players King\u2019s are both still alive by the 64 moves that the players must kill the opponent, but the player was already captured by his/her King\u2019s before the 64 moves, the score is for both players their 8th move. If both are captured, it\u2019s a tie. If the king\u2019s are both captured on the last move, then the score is their last move. If they both die the same move, then it\u2019s a double. If a players King dies, but the oppositions King still lives, then the score is the players 8th move. The player who has the most points wins the game. Calculate the average number of points that a chess players scores in a game. Round this number off to the hundredths place.

The question begins by stating, \"Weng earns $ 12 an hour for Babysitting.\" We can determine that babysitting is a unit of time, as indicated by the word 'hours' in the first sentence. We will refer to such a unit as a 'babysitting hour' from now on.\n2. The context of the question is that babysitting can be completed in one unit of time: a babysitting hour.\n3. We can determine that after doing 50 mins of babysitting, Weng earned $ 12. This means that $ 12 should be divided by five ($ 12 / 5) and should be multiplied by the unit count ($ 12 /5 x 50).\n4. There are thus five ways to solve the question. We can also break down the steps of each method for clarity:\n\nM1:  $ 12 x 50 = $ 600 \n\nM2:  $ 100/12 = 8  \n $ 100 x 50 =$ 5,000.\n\nM3:  $ 25/12 = $ 0.2 $ 0.2 x 50= $ 10.\n\nM4:  $ 2.50 /12= 0.20. $ 50 x 0.2 =$ 10.\nM5:  $ 1 / 12 = $ 25 $ 25 x 50 = 1250.\n\nSolution: Option M3, M4, M5 and M1 are incorrect according to the conditions mentioned in the question.

Using the data in the question, we can determine that the number of purple and yellow flowers is 100% of the total number of flowers.\n2) Since there are 25% as few green flowers as there are purple and yellow flowers, the total number of green flowers = Total number of purple and Yellow flowers - 25%\n3) Using the formula Total green flowers = Total purple and yellow flowers - 25%,\nwe can simplify the formula as Total green flowers = 0.8 * Total purple and yellow flows\n\n4) Then,\nTotal green flowers = (0.8)* 100 = 80\n5) Therefore, the total number of flowered plants in Mark's garden is 80.\nSo the final\noutput is 80\n\n##### Hint 0:\n\nMark's garden can have a total of 80 flowers, because:\n\n80 = 100 -- 25\n\n5\n\nThe number of purple and yella flowers are the same, 100\n\nThe question asks for the number of green flowers, which has to be: 80 (or 80%)\n\nThe question doesn't mention the number of purple or green flowers in the same sentence, so the answer must be 80\n\n\n##### Hints 1:\n\nMark has a garden with 3 colors of flowers.

This implies that the box already has a weight of 0, which implies that it was empty when he started adding things to it.\n4. For every step he adds, he also subtracts the original weight, so there was never a positive or negative impact on the total weight.\n5. The care package is a box, and each of the choices given represent possible things that might be added to or be in the box.\n6. However, none of the choices can be combined to arrive at the final weight, so eliminating these choices is logical.\n7. We then can narrow down to 2 pounds and 3 pounds. Each of these can be further narrowed down to two possible values.\n8. 2 pounds corresponds to 2 ounces, which is equivalent to.914 pounds. But the final package we are talking about is 3 pounds, so this does not match.\n9. Similarly, 3 pounds corresponds to 3.21 ounces and cannot be combined with any of the choices of.914 or.985, thus not matching.\n10.

{"idx": 9, "text": "1 Alexis is applying for a job and went to the department store and chose to buy an entire suit. Since she has $16 left on her budget, she could buy a pair of shorts instead of shoes.\n2 Since Alexis bought a suit coat or jacket, she has the entire outfit, and if she bought a pair of pants separately, she would be much more likely to look cheap.\n3 Let's first consider how much she spent on the suit coat. In the problem, we are told she spent $38 on the suit coat, so she spent exactly 2/3 of her available budget on the suit coat. Multiplying the price of the suit coat ($38) by 3/4 ($50) will give us a total of $96, so Alexis spent 3/4 of her budget on the suit coat, and since she spent 2/3 of the remaining 1/4 of her budget ($10/14= $16), she spent $12 on the suit coat.\n4 Next we look at her socks. We first figure out how much the jacket plus socks costs. We know that $38 bought the jacket and that $11 bought socks, so we have $38+$11 to find how much the jacket and socks cost together.\n5 $38+$10= $58\n6 $58-$11= $47\n7 $47+$11= $58\n8 Therefore, the suit jacket and socks together cost $58\n9 Let's next find out what the shoes cost. We already know that she spent $16 on the shoes, so we can subtract the $16 from the extra $16 in her budget to find out.\n10 $16- $16= $0\n11 Therefore, the pair of shoes cost nothing!\n12 So the answer is 0, and in fact the pair of shoes could be free!\nSo the final answer will  be 0", "answer": " 41"}

Choices:  A : plant more trees  B : plant more grass  C : cut down on excess waste  D : drink less bottled water\nOutput: 1: The question asks that we select a single option that provides the most efficient methodology to reduce water pollution. In order to determine an efficient method for water pollution, we must understand what factors are causing the water pollution and what we might be able to do to alleviate these causes.\n2. It is clear from the question that water pollution primarily results from excess human waste entering the water cycle. This makes planting more grass likely to have a very low impact on the reduction of water pollution, as it might provide more vegetation but would not significantly reduce the amount of waste entering the water cycle on a widespread basis. The second most likely cause is the human use of plastic, which can contribute to airborne pollution and the accumulation of trash on shorelines. Reducing one's dependence on plastic bottles for drinking water or other beverages reduces this source of pollution; however, planting more trees will have no impact.\n3.

Jack collects the remaining liquid, which has a salt concentration of 20%, and tastes it.

At this stage, he knows that each litre of seawater originally contained 500 ml (4 liters / 2 liters = 4 liters / 1000 ml = 0.4 liters) of water.\n4. Therefore, each litre of sewage contains 2 litres of water and 0.4 litres of salt in total.

We cannot determine the specific number of pieces of pizza that are left uneaten because we do not know the total number of pieces.\n3. We can identify some possible ratios, however, that can help us determine the answer. One possible way to calculate is to multiply all of the consumption rates, to find the total amount of pizzas eaten.\n\n$\\text { Eaten } = \\text { Eaten } x 100\\% = \\text { Consumption } \\times \\text { Percentage } $\n\nWe can then plug in the respective individual consumption rates in which Bill and Dale would account for 50% and Ann and Cate would account for 75%.\n\n$\\text { Total Consumption } = \\text { Bill, Dale } + \\text { Ann, Cate } = \\frac {2}{4}x100\\% = 50 \\% + \\frac {4}{4}x133.3\\% = 75 \\% $\n\nNext we will subtract the total amount of pizza actually eaten by the total amount of pizan left uneaten, which can be found by multiplying total consumption by 100% to find the total amount eaten, then subtracting this from the total number of pizza bought for the group.\n\n$\\text{ Eaten } = \\frac {Total Consumption }{100\\%}$\n\n$\\text{ Remaining } = \\text{ Total Consumption } - \\text{ Eaten }$\n4.

However, some libraries allow borrowing of physical items - books, movies, magazines etc - whilst others may provide computers, charging stations, bookable study rooms or even lounge areas where you can relax, play games or listen to music.\n4. This difference means that the location may not necessarily be a library, but could instead be any other suitable place where library-like services might be found, such as a library, school, public institution, or even private space operated by a library.\n5. Furthermore, some items found in a library may not necessarily require borrowing, and may instead be available for use within the building, such as books, computers, study areas, or even just lounge areas to relax.\n6.

{"idx": 64, "text": "1)The question is asking how many situps Shawna would need to do on Wednesdays in order to'make up' for not achieving her goal and finish her minimum required workout.\n2) It is not clear whether Shawna would meet her minimum goal if she completed all 30 situps on Wednesday. If she completed all 31 and her minimum goal was 30, she would have exceeded her goal.\n3) The question describes Shawna only completing 12 situps on Monday and then 19 on Tuesday, not specifying if she met her goal. If her goal was 18 she would have only needed to do 9 on Wednesday, but if her goal was 26 she would have only needed 6. It's not clear whether she met her goal in the description so the correct answer will depend on this.\n4) We can therefore conclude that Shawna didn't attain her goal and didn't finish her minimum required work out on Monday or Tuesday, so she must continue to the next day to meet her goal. Therefore, Shawna will need a total of 16 situps on Wednesdays and Thursdays to complete her minimum goal if she met all 30 of her situation goal on the first two days, and a total of 19 situps if she did not meet her goal and needed to do an extra set to'make up' the extra situps.\nSo the final answers is A) 16 situps for 15 extra situp and B) 19 situps for 1 extra situp.", "answer": " 59"}

{"idx": 67, "text": "1. In this case, the questions asks us to solve for the number of months after the down payment has been made in order to figure out the remaining monthly payment.\n2.  A down payment is typically defined as the portion of the total cost of an item paid in advance, so this term already has the assumption that a down payment has been made.\n3.  The first part of the question informs us that Tara has already made the down payment of $200.\n4.  Since 20% is a fraction, then we can assume that Tara is going to purchase the laptop using a loan. This is because if the company accepted payment in installments, it would have required them to make $20 down payment, which is a fraction of $65 so the company would have needed to know the entire cost. Otherwise, the company would have used another metric of payment.\n5. So, the total cost can be calculated as $1200 instead of $1000 since $200 have been already paid in advance.\n6.  The company only requires 20% down, so Tara is paying the rest after that. According to the given question, Tara is paying $1200 with $200 down payment.\n7. Let x be the amount of months which Tara wanted to complete the payment, and assume she wants the whole payment to be made.\n\nSo, we can write the system of inequalities:\n\n7x+ $200= $1200\n\n8x + $65 = 1200 - $200\n\n9 -x = 20 - 20\n\n-x = -4\n\nx = 4\n\nAfter 4 months, Tara has been completed the payment.\nSo the final solution after 4 months is: $2000\n\n\n\n\nInput: The sum of a number is 4 times it's square.What would the number be?\nOutput: 1 The question states that the sum of a number is four times the number squared.

This can be written as M - T < 60, where 'M' refers to Martha, 'T' refers to Tim and '60' is our reference value.\n4. By subtracting 30 from 60, we can see that Martha has 30 more apples than Tim. We can use this to solve for Harry.\n5. Given that Tim has 60 more apples than Harry, we can add 30 to 30 to come up with '50'.

This indicates that she is selling handmade crafts or goods to customers at a price of 12 dollars per item.\n3) Following this, \"Today, Hillary sells three crafts and is given seven dollars from an appreciative shopper\". This implies that she sells three crafts today and receives 7 dollars as profit from a grateful customer.\n4) \"Later on, Hillary deposited eighteen dollars from today's gains into her bank account\". This shows that Hillary has made profits of 18 dollars from selling the three crafts she sold and the seven dollars she garnered from the customer.\n\n5) Finally, we are asked to determine how much money Hillary has left with her after making the deposit. We know she has sold 3 crafts and made a profit of 7 dollars from a 4th customer. This means she has 4 crafts left and an extra 11 dollars in hand, in total.\n6) To determine Hillary's final balance, we can use the following steps to add the three crafts to her bank balance of 18 dollars.\n  6.1) First, determine the total value of the three crafts added together, which is 12 x 3 = 36 dollars.\n  6(6).2) Next, we need to add the 7 dollars she got from her 4th customer to the value of 36 dollars and the balance she has in her bank account.

Horns that are played at 100 km/hr have the less power.\n4. Horns would have little influence over anything when driving through a mountain.\n\nLet's look at the last choice E. Any other horns? Why not, this can have any other horn.\n\n4: We can consider all other options and realise that they are incorrect.\n\n5: The answer now is E. Car horns that aren't plugged in to any other source of power have very little power when sounded.\n\nHence the answer is E\n\nInput: John left for work at 7:30 am.

So, we have two points. Two months ago, 5 months ago, and 3 months ago. Now, let me go to each option. Let's think about this like this, option A says \"Jolyn 7 months and Leon 7 months\", this is not possible because there would be no point in 3 months ago which they missed at the options and also 1, Jolyn 7 months which is not true because they are already given there as 2 month difference only that's true, 2 months ago, 5 month ago and 3 months ago but if they would be 7 months then there no point of having 2 months in first option, option B says \"Jolyn : 6 months and Leon : 6 months\", this sounds like a good one, it could be a possible answer, but again they left the point at the options for \"5 month ago\", so this is not true too, option C says \"Jolyn: 10 months and Leon: 10 months\", this option sound's like true, but again they left out the point in the options, which was option A, at 1month, they started at 6 months, so option C is not possible, 5 months ago and 3 months as they skipped that at the options, now only remaining is one answer so it's D, Jolyn is 1 month older than Leon.

Gail follows a \"one gallon:inch\" rule and plans to stock the second tank with 2 inch fish and the first tank with 3 inch fish. Now it comes in handy to note that 1 gallon = 231 cm3. This helps us get the fish measurements in centimeters.\n2. Therefore, there are 86 cm3 of fish in the second tank while there are 139 cm3 of fish in first. Gail would have a total of 225 cm3 of fish.\n3. Now, a fish of length of 2 inches is 4.5 cm long while a fish of length of three inches is about 7 cm long. This yields 90 cm of fish. For every 9 cm height, there are 10 fish. We already found that Gail has a total of 233 cm3 of fish. Now, if one of the fish ate another, how much would become unavailable? 90 cm fish is equal to 300 cm3 of fish.

{"idx": 108, "text": "1: There are a number of logical conclusions to be drawn from the question stem. The sentence \"There is very little car\" implies that there isn't much traffic on Happy Street, which would be contradicted if more than 5 cars travelled down it on weekends. Also, the mention of days such as \"Tuesday\" and \"Wednesday\" implies that Happy Street is only used during weekdays.\n2. The first logical step would be to define the population of cars that travel on Happy Street during a week. This is defined in the question statement as the cars that travel down Happy Street on the \"during the week, most cars\" pass it on Tues \"25\".\n3. The question mentions that Monday, 20\"less\" than Tuesday, and Wednesday, \"2 more cars(than Monday)\" than Tuesday. This implies that the number of cars travelling on the two days are the same, thus reducing the number of cars passing Happy Street on Monday.\n4. On Thursday, Friday, Monday and Tuesday, the number of cars passing on those days are all the same - which is about 10.\n5. On the weekends, i.e Friday and Saturday, the number of cars traveling is about \"5.\" Thus the total number of cars that travel down Happy street on a weekday is 10, on Friday 5 and on Saturday 5.\n6. Therefore we can reasonately say that the number of cars travel down Happy Street on weekdays is 10, and the number of cars travel across it on the weekend is 5.\n7. Then all we have to do is to add up these numbers to determine the total number of cars on Happy Street.\n8. To determine the answer for this question, multiply the number of car that travel down the street during weekdays with Monday-Friday(6 days) to determine how many cars travel during the week. Then add that number with the number which travel on weekends, resulting to 20+5 = 25 as the answer.

This implies that he was competitively selected to the team and is not someone who joined the team for support or pleasure.\n2. The second part talks about James playing for 15 games and scoring a total of 48 touchdowns throughout the season. These touchdowns are worth 240 points (48*6*) individually, so his total score comes out to 2560.\n3. The next part discusses James managing to score '2 point conversions 5 times' during the course of the season. This is an extra 10 points (5 * 2), making his total now 2570.\n4. The final part talks about James 'beating the old record' by '240 points'. While this is technically true, it might seem odd since it is a very large amount of additional points - almost double his original total!

It could be interpreted that James beat the record by 240 points only in comparison with the previous record, which was only 300.\n5.

The hare may be faster than the turtle at 10 feet/sec, but it's slower than the turtle in the context of the whole race as it runs for a shorter distance.\n4. The turtle is slower than the hare at 1 feet/sec, but faster over the context of the whole 20 feet.\n5: It's clear that in this scenario, the turtle will finish in a tie/finish at the same time as the hare since the turtle (1 feet/sec) moves slower than the hare (10 feet/sec). \n6: However, to finish in a tie, the turtle must take a certain number of seconds head start.\n7: Let's solve the problem: To finish first, the hare needs to take (20 feet/10 feet/second of the hare) - (1 feet/second of the turtle) = 19 feet.\n8: So the hare needs to move at 19 feet/second for total of 19 seconds to finish 100 meters.\n9: Since the turtle moves at 1 feet/second it requires 20 seconds to travel to the finish line.

B: They need less time and effort.  C: You can always go back and read them.  D: They can be used to communicate even when you\u2019re not available by phone.\nOutput: 1) There may be more convenient methods for communicating, but the choice of letter or text message depends upon what kind of detail you want to share. For quick communication, text messages are typically chosen. 2) Letters are written with pen and paper, and are usually more time consuming than texting; therefore, they don\u2019t allow the same amount of spontaneous communication.  This advantage is what makes text messages more popular than letters.\nThere is no reason to go back and read a letter that you are not expecting a reply to, as this is not how a letter works. A letter usually only has one way of conveying the intended message, so the same message will be passed each time.\nA text message, however, can be edited to fit whatever the situation calls for at any given time.  The other option, that text messages can be used even when not available on the phone, does not fit into the question.\nSince there are many other means of communicating, there is not necessarily an expectation that a letter should be replied to prompt", "answer": " 58"}

{"idx": 182, "text": "1) A tree can be given a measured height and a growing speed, in which case the formula to work out its growth is ((x + 1)*growth_rate), where x is the starting height and growth rate is the percentage growth. You can use the growth formula to calculate the tree's height from when we first measure it to when the tree has grown to a height of more than 1,000 kilometers. 2) We can solve this question by subtracting the time when the tree is measured. Let's consider the 2017 measurement to mark the time our tree is planted. We first subtracted the year the tree was measured to find the remaining time it took to grow to this point (let's call this the time it took for the tree to grow up 100cm). Then, we subtract that same amount of time from the time it took to grow up to the height of more than 914 meters (1). 3) Here's how to get the time it took for this tree to go up to 914 meters. In 2018, the tree reached 100 meters. In 23 years, the tree had reached only 109 meters, the growth of four meters in 2017 and four meters in 23 years. 4) But in 2019, the tree grew to 193 meters. So in that third year, it grew 90 meters instead of four. If you are willing to accept the fact that it would not have grown that fast if it started from only 100m, we can then assume that it grows more in that third year. And in 23 years, it will grow 940 meters, which would mean it grew 90m in 2018. 5) Therefore, this tree has grown more than 910 meters over 3 years; a growth rate of 910/3 = 240 meters per year. Then, we plug the answer 1) in to find the tree height at the end of 1 year. 6) Since the tree grew 240m every year, the tree was first measured 100m and grew 104m by 2018; 104 + 104 = 20", "answer": " 21"}

Then it gives the details of her running schedule for a week. We can note that she spends a total of 3 hours 30 minutes running over the week.\n3. The key question is how many minutes she should run on Friday to meet the goal of running 20 miles for that week. To answer this, we can use the information given to calculate the total number of miles she has run so far.\n4. The total number of miles she ran is 6 x 3 = 18 miles. Then, since she aims to reach 20 miles, we have to add 2 more to reach a total of 20 miles over one week.\n5. Therefore, to run 20 total miles in one week, she must run for 40 minutes on Friday.\nSo the final answers is D: 40 minutes\n\nInput: Renee, who works in the office, knows very little Spanish. She knows the phrase \"\u00bfDe donde es la biblioteca?\" which means \"Where is the library?\"\nOutput: 1) The given dialogue starts with a man (Oliver) who tries asking a question of a woman (Renee) in Spanish. Renee answers, but doesn't speak any Spanish.\n2) The man then says he's very bad at languages, and asks her how he can ask for directions to get to the library. Oliver is clearly not confident in Spanish here.\n3) Then, the woman answers by saying how she doesn't know Spanish, but has a phrase for him, suggesting she can still help by providing one phrase to communicate with him.\n4) Since Oliver mentions he's not good at languages, and needs to communicate with the librarian to get directions, Renee's answer of \"\u00bfDe donde es?\" is likely to be relevant as it is a phrase for asking someone where they are from.\n5) Renee's phrase is \"desde d\u00f3nde\", which translates to \"from where\", and she knows this by adding \"\u00bfDe donde es\" to the phrase.\n6) Therefore, the answer to the question is that Renee knows that phrase.\nSo", "answer": " 30"}

Since a witch is always casting spells, if they\u2019re really casting spells, then they probably shouldn\u2019t blow out the candles which are lit for the spells to occur. (But witches generally do this before they cast the spell.) \nIn terms of jobs, we know a witch is always busy with her spells, so that probably isn\u2019t applicable. \nThe part that doesn\u2019t fit is the brewing part. They don\u2019t always make her brew which could be assumed to be beer.\nAs a witch, you\u2019ll notice a big part of the witchcraft is the incantations.\nSo the option", "answer": " 30"}

Which means that we are done.\n2) What does this quesiton mean? It means Ravi has some coins and we have to find how many it is.\n3) So Ravi has 2 more quaters than nickels. Because we know the amount of quaters is 6, we know that the amount of nickels is 4. So we have 4/2 = 2. Then we have to divide 6 by 2 and see that the amount left is 3. Which means that we can get the amount of nickles to be 10.\n4) 4 more dimes. Dimes are worth 10 cents and nickles are worth 5 cents. So if you have 4 more dimes you have 4*10=40 cents. We already know that the amount of dimes is 6 so we know that the amount to nickles is 6-4 =2.\n5) So we get the amount of nickels to be 10 and 6/2=3. So we have 3/2=1.5 which we rounded to 1. So we get 3+1.5= 4.5 and 1.5+1 = 2.5.\n6) 6/2= the amount of nickels. 10-6=4 and 1.5-1= 0.5 (half of a cent) which is what we should leave.

We know that Lisa has eaten 1/4th of the total hotdogs required in the allotted time, i.e. she's eaten 20 out of 75.\n3. Lisa was eating 15 hotdogs per minute, then, as we cannot calculate a fraction in minutes as it can only be calculated in seconds, we will convert minutes to seconds.\n4. 1/4th = 180 seconds, so Lisa is eating an average of 15 hotdos every 180 seconds (1/4th of 2 minutes).\n5. Lisa has 180 seconds left to eat 75 hotdogs or 1/2 of remaining 75.\n6. Let us calculate 1/2 of 75,\n7. 1/2 * 75 = 75/2 = 37.5\n8.

Therefore, we cannot simply sum up the capacity of all the tables and arrive at the number of chairs in the hall.\n2.

Instead, in this question, Ian has chosen to give the money to someone so the money is already gone. This means there is a difference of $120 from the original question.\n4. Instead of writing a complicated answer, let's go through the three steps in the reasoning.\n5. Starting off, Ian wins $100 and decides to use the money to settle his debt.\n6. To do this, he knows that he needs to pay off the debt twice as much as he has paid it. Let us call that figure $$X$$ as $X$.\n7. He uses this figure $X$ (which has yet to be calculated) to settle his debts of $20 and $40 to Colin and Helen respectively (this is done by paying off the debt $40 to Helen twice).\n8. Using the fact that he has now paid the debt $44 to Colin and Helen, he calculates the final figure $$X$$ using the amount of debt that he has paid so far.\n9. We have $$X= 44 - (20+40) =34$$\n10.

(a) (b) (c) (d) Given that Emery borrows a book as fast as five times as fast as her friend, their reading times will be related by (210) = 5. Then we ask what is the difference between the two reading times as Emery reads so fast, the difference in their reading times is five times as much as Serenna. Thus the difference between the two, when Emery can read five-times as fast can be given by ((31)/2 ) = 3. We ask how long will they each take to read the book. In Emery's case, it is 5 times Serenna, so the duration is 5-times, which is 3/2 times, which is 1/2 times as long. In other words, if Emery finishes in 20 days, Serenna's rate of reading must be equal to 1/5 as fast to finish in that same amount of time.

{"idx": 241, "text": "1) The question is about the difference in quantity of red balls Kate bought compared to yellow balls.\n2) Considering only two possible outcomes, we must first eliminate any options that do not make sense. \"13\" is not a meaningful expression for the difference of 2 quantities, so the answer must not be 13.\n3) Similarly, the difference of two whole numbers is always greater than or equal to 0, so we can use any whole number as the difference. The only number not used is 2, which indicates the smallest possible difference between 2 quantities. As 2 cannot be found as the answer, the difference must be greater than 2.\n4) Since the problem does not mention 2 balls, the difference cannot be greater than 21. Similarly, the difference cannot be less than 1, so the answer is between 3 and 29.\n5) The options that were ruled out can now be compared for accuracy, but 26 and 30 are greater than 2, and 19 and 27 are less than 2. As the problem only requires that the number of more red balls than yellow balls be found, the only option that would not make sense in this scenario is 7.\n6) Therefore, the answer is 15 since choosing a 7 pack of red balls over a 6 pack of yellow balls would be 1 more pack of red balls.\nSo the final answers is 15\n\n## **Sample Question: (The original Question had 4 options. the below steps shows how to eliminate options)**\n\nSample Question: What can you make from a set of n bricks?

True or False\nOutput:  The problem statement defines the pizza chain's sales as \"its revenue before any costs are taken out\u201d. Sales or revenue, in general, refers to the total amount of money a business earns from offering its goods or services. Therefore, 1) If the chain' 20% increase in sales results from an increase of 14% in the price of its pizzas, then it means that the chain's prices have gone up. This means that its revenue has increased, but any increase in prices will be followed by an increase in costs, or rather, vice versa. If the costs do not exceed the income the business makes from selling 20% more pizzas, then the chain will be making profit. However, if costs increase so that it takes more money to produce the same number of pizzas than the revenue generated from the pizzas being sold, the business will no longer be making a profit and will be making a loss. 2) The business may, at some point or another, start making a profit again if its costs decrease. 3) Thus, it is not a given that the pizza chain would make a profit even after increasing its prices by 14%. In the end, there's a chance that the pizza chain could either lose money or just", "answer": " 30"}

The question is asking us what foods can be taken to avoid vitamin defecency, not what foods should be taken to avoid being on energy deficiency.\n2. C: foods that rich in vitamins refers to foods such as fruits and vegetables that contain a high level of micronutrients, including vitamins. This does not address the issue of deficiency and so is inaccurate.\n3.

Oranges are mentioned but excluded because we're assuming they weren't part of the initial purchase.\n2. You can buy either 4 apples of 1 watermelons for the same price.\n3. For simplicity, let's say the initial purchase has all fruits. In that case, the price of all fruits must be equal to the price of 1 apple. So if 1 apple costs $0.25 (e.g. $67-66), how many apples bought does one fruit make? You'll get 4 apples. From there you should know the price of one apple from 4 apples bought.\nSo the final price of one apple is 1/4th of the total price. 4 apples/$66=0.25$. If you bought 36 fruits and 32 apples and 4 watermelons, this means that 1 apple will cost you 0.25$ (and not.23$ as the answer claims).\nSo the final answer does not match!", "answer": " 1"}

Choices:  (i) A. a baseball bat (ii) B. a large weapon (iii) C. two friends (iv) D. a small weapon (v) E. a strong argument \nOutput:  10. The question asks what action would be the most effective at deterring an attacker, so we can eliminate (A) - a baseball bat, since it is not designed to deter attackers but instead as a defensive weapon.\n2. Option (ii) doesn't really specify what kind of weapon the person is seeking, but rather the size of it. That means it is not going to be a guarantee that the attacker will fear it - in fact a large weapon might cause the assailant to think that he can outlive the danger or fight back, rather than to run off immediately. Therefore this is not the most relevant option.\n3. Option C (two friends) is not the best answer because it is rather unlikely that two people could form a barrier that would block the attacker from getting to the potential victim. The attacker might see it as an obstacle but there is no guarantee that he won't just attack the other person rather than the intended person, or bypass the barrier and the friends, for example by getting through an open window into the person's home.\n4. Option D (a small weapon) seems reasonable but would not necessarily be a deterrent to an attack", "answer": " 3"}

The first 3 steps in the procedure will yield $10 (20 trees x $.5 per unit), and this gives a clue that what we are looking for is the last step in which we multiply by 3 because John sells again 20 times (multiplier 3).

Answer choices 'A', 'B', and 'C', contain phrases like 'I take the test', 'I have done it before', 'Everybody takes the test', etc which are in the form of sentences or expressions.\n3.

{"idx": 266, "text": "This question asks for the height Larry and Barry can reach combined when Barry stands on Larry'\n2.  The first thing to do is to get rid of all the options except for A, so that we don't waste too much time on options that don't make sense in this context, given what we know about the problem.\n3.  When looking at choice A, the two things that could affect whether there is 10 feet of tree between the top of the bucket and the apples we want to pick and whether Barry's body is the same height as the top of the tree - if we look at the tree, it is 10 feet in height, so we can reason that even if Larry didn't have a 10% smaller shoulder height ratio, he and Barry together would be able to pick the apples.\n4.  Hence, A is not a solution, and we can move onto the next option, B\n5.  Option B is not a good answer because we know that Barry stands 20% taller than Larry - so standing on his shoulders would not make Larry taller and more likely to be able to pick the apple.  In other words, choosing this option will be a waste of our time and it doesn't fit, so this option is eliminated.\n6.  Hence we can consider remaining choices C and D.  Option C says that Barry standing on Larry's shoulder \"would make them taller.  Then Larry can reach for an apple, standing on his brother's shoulder.\"  This is not correct because we know Barry is already taller than Larry - standing on Larry's shoulders would not make Larry and Barry taller together\n7.  There is also a logical fallacy in this choice: the option is not specifying how tall Larry would be together with Barry.   Also, standing on someone's shoulder would not make someone's body 50% taller, which is what choice D says\n8.

{"idx": 267, "text": "2. A gym typically has equipment for lifting weights and cardio. This includes the machines for weightlifting and running. Additionally, he also takes 30 minutes out of the day for warm up and cardio exercises. We know that this is not enough to complete the 1 hours of lifting weights, but it is a start. By combining this with the fact that John is in the gym for 3 hours a day, we can deduce that he spends about 30 minutes of each hour for warm up and cardiovascular exercises, leaving him with 45 minutes each day for weight lifting.\n3. So, for a total of 30 minutes every day for cardio and about 2.25 hours each day for weight lifitting, John spends about 3 hours exercising at the gym every day.\n4. Now, he goes there three times a week, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Therefore, his total weekly weightlifting time would be 9 hours, not 11. We get this figure by adding 3 hours of weight lifting each day for the 3 days that John goes to the gym. This is because John does not go to the gym on the weekends, hence he gets a rest day to recuperate from the intense weight lifting he does. In sum, we can determine that John spends 9 hours or 11/3 hours per week (since he gets a rest day on Wednesday) at the gym lifting weights.\n5. For an estimation of the remaining 2.25hours each day that we did not account for in our calculations, we consider other activities at the gym, like drinking water and using the bathroom, but we also exclude the time wasted while waiting for equipment.\n6. By combining all of this, we get an approximate result of 6.25 hours per week for the remaining activities in the gym, which is equivalent to about 2 hours per day.\n7. Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is that John spends a total of 11hours or 2.25/3hours a day 3 times a week (or about 2 hours a day).\nSo the final answer should be 2 times 30 for 90 mins\n\nInput:", "answer": " 4"}

We can notice that Sabrina has already finished four books in a month-and-a-half, so by doing this she has only read half as many books as the total number there are in the series (14).\n3. There are 200 pages per book, so there are 2,000 pages for the series.\n4. Since Sabrina has already read four books and there are now 14 books left, we can calculate in this manner: (A) Sabrina has read 2,004 pages of books which is 204 more than 2,001 pages. She must read a total of 2,009 pages to finish the series of books in 14 books.\nSo the final question is: 14 x 200 = 2800 2801 2802 = 2803 2804 2805 2806 2807 2808 2809\nSo the final answer here is 2809 pages.\n\nInput: In the game Go, what is the \"capturing jump number\"?

{"idx": 281, "text": "The question describes a situation where a boy buys 6 cards at 2 different prices from 2 different boxes, the first containing 6 cards at a price of $1.25 and the second containing 6 cards at $1.75. To find the total cost of the cards he bought, we will need to calculate their price.\n1. The total cost can be found by calculating the sum of each card individually, and then adding that sum to itself a total number of times.\n2. This calculation will need to refer to the amount of cards he takes from the first box and the second box, the total number of cards in each box, and the respective cost of the cards in each box.\n3. First we can determine the total number of cards he buys: 6 cards \n4. We then need to find the total price of each card in each box: total price = $7.50 + $12.50 \n5. Next we must multiply the price of each card by the number of cards purchased to find the total cost of each box: total cost of the first box = (6 x $7.50) = $45 total cost of the second box = (6 x$12.50) =$75 \n6. Finally we can find the total cost of all the cards he bought: total cost = ($45 x 6) + ($75 x 6) = $630\n7.

Time spent practicing can have a wide range of values because throwing a temper tantrum is determined by how long it takes for Carlotta to be given a break, but we only know how long Carlotta spends singing on stage\n2. As for time spent throwing tantrums: we know that Carlotta spends 5 minutes throwing tantrums after she finishes singing for 6 minutes on stage in total, so we can calculate that the time spent throwing tantrum must be : 6 - 1 ==5 3. A person throwing tantrums probably does not take 3 minutes to practice a performance, this also means that the calculation of the time spent practicing is inaccurate 4. When we subtract practice time form the overall total time, we only obtain the value -7, but according to the conditions, there should be a 0 time, which is impossible 5. When the overall time is calculated properly( without subtracting practice time ), we can see that it does not satisfy the boundary conditions 6.

This can be seen for following values:\n\n21+6=27, therefore answer must be 27.\nSo the final approach to solution will be:\n-Total cars are 23 and there will be 3/4 motorcycles so:\n\n23-1=22, which means 22 out of 23 will be motorcycles and we assume that all cars need a tire.\nIf we assume all cars are same as motorcycles then we can say that 3/3 is number of tire in motorcycles and 3/2 in cars so:\n3/3+3/2=9/6+3/2=12 /6, which means 2 tires are needed to cars.\nSo, 12+3=15 or 21 tires are needed in all cars.\n2)Lets again consider the problem in following way:\n\nIf there are total of 24 vehicles, then there will be 24/24th's which in our case will be number of motorcycles.

But we also know that she does not go every week, so we cannot assume she will not buy extras every week either.\n3: At the same time, we can't simply guess that there will be 10/4 of weekend days where she buys an extra chocolate, since the question only asks for the month. This is because her \"month\" will consist of 4 weekends (3 consecutive ones at least).

The second half of the question says that she uses a ratio of 2 ounces of oil and 8 ounces of peebled peanuts in every batch. We can get this by first working out the equivalent of smooth peanuts in weight in '8 ounces'(weighed by peebled peanut) in a batch. Then we will get the other equivalent(weight of oil) as the ratio specifies. We know that the weight of peebled peebled peanuto is twice it's volume, so the total weight of 8 ounces(smooth-peebled) peanut is equal to the its volume times weight. In math this can be represented by the equation 8 ounces=Volume*(713.7 ounces/peebled-peened peanut)\n3. To find the volume of 8 ouns in smooth peanut, we can multiply 8 by 2. This gives us the volume of 16 ounces smooth peanuts in a batch. Because now we found that 2 ounces is to be used in a batch, so the volume of 2 ouns in the peanut is 16*.16=0.25 ouns, and we know it by the name(since this is the ouns equivalent of the amount of oil needed in each batch) so now Sonja needs the weight of the quantity in the volume..25 ouns is equal to.0436 pound, and we know that in a batch of 20 oz she needs.25 oz of oil. Now we can find the weight of the ingredients in a batch. Volume of 20 in peanut smooth peanut is 32 ouns and we have the weight of the oil.25 oun. This tells us that Sonja used.45 pound of oil in a batch of 40 ouns(this is to compensate the weight of 2 ounes peanut and oil,", "answer": " 4"}

Their impact on human health has been widely studied in the food industry.\n3-Wolves are similar to bees in that they are both considered 'pests' by humans, although they perform functions that are beneficial for humans. Wolves have a significant impact on animal populations and the ecosystem in general. However, they only have a limited direct effect on human health.\n4-Dogs have a long history of domestication, and serve a variety of functions for humans, including companionship and protection. They have also contributed to human health in countless ways, ranging from the detection of disease in early humans to their use as therapy dogs today. Overall, dogs are more helpful to humans than wolves.\n5-Horses are often used as transport, and in other productive purposes, but their contribution to human health is comparatively limited.

We can then identify whether his time is based on the number of windows or the size of the windows.\n1. Since the sentence says \"it takes him 10 minutes to clean 4 windows\", we know that the task is completed per window. So the answer would never exceed 24 minutes, since he would have completed 4 windows in 10 minutes and then he would begin to start a 5 minute window, but he wouldn't complete that one yet. So this answer will never exceed 24.\n2. We can use division to determine how long it would take to wash all his windows. 4 / 10 = 0.4. Therefore, the answer would be approximately 40-45 minutes.\nSo the final ans is D: about 45 minutes\n\nInput:Where can you purchase your favorite movie?

Most films are broadcast on television today. There are many channels that include both short films and their movies. So the answer is A.\n2. B: cinema - while this is somewhat valid, you could still buy a DVD or rent a movie. A cinematic experience is now also a common thing, and films are now available as VOD content.\n3. C: store - this makes no sense because movies are available only in very limited stores, and they don't usually put movies on sale.\n4. D: DVD player - this is a good answer because you need a DVD player and it's used for this purpose. However, more modern devices can play movies and make other options available.\n5.

Suppose Alice wants Jesse as a choice.  That means Jake would have two choices (Brandon and Alex), Kyle would have two choices (Jesse and Alex).  Jesse and Alice will only have one choice each.

How many seconds later did he pass the train? Choices: 1 sec 2 sec 4 sec 8 sec 16 sec\nOutput:4.12 4.13 4.14 4.15 4.16 4.17 4.18 4.19\nExplanation:In the question, it is specified that the car had a speed of 27 km/hr and was going in the same direction as the train. This makes it clear that the train is stationary and thus has a speed of zero km/hr.The question asks how many seconds later did the car overtake the train. It is given that the train was moving at the constant speed of 100km/hr. This means that the car is always accelerating and, in particular, it is accelerating at a rate of 27km/hr.Since the train is travelling at a constant speed of 1 00hm, the car is travelling at a faster speed than the train in respect to both time and distance. It will thus require 4.17 seconds for the car to overtake the train.This is the case because the car is moving at a greater rate of speed than the stationary train, and because a 1 kilometre journey is 4.17 minutes at a speed of 10km/hr.\n\nInput: I was born in the year 1850 I moved to New York City in the year 1900 I became a citiz", "answer": " 14"}

This implies that the washing machine in question washes sheets and towels on the same cycle settings, as opposed to sheets being washed on a different cycle than towels.\n4) With this information, let's consider the lengths of time each pile takes to complete. Because there is only 1 pile for clothes that need to washed on the gentle cycye and the question specifies that a pair of clothes takes 30 minutes to be washed, we can infer that it takes 30 minutes for clothes to be washed on a gentle cycle.\n5) From this, we can eliminate option A: \"30 minutes\".\n6) We know 30 minutes for a pair of clothes takes a gentle cycle but 15 minutes less for sheets, since Naomi's washing cycle takes the same amount of time for sheets as clothes.\nUsing this information, we can eliminate options C and D which state that it must take the same amount more than a pair of clothes.\n7) Therefore, Option B: \"45 minutes\"is the correct answer.\nWith 1 pile taking 3o minutes to complete, Naomi will be able to complete her three piles at 30 minutes a piece.\n\nInput:  Two students are studying a language that has sounds that don't exist in English.

In this case, the nth term is the amount of weight Karen is carrying after each hour, so we can substitute the values to get:\n=> 50/2(1/5) = 50/10 = 5.\nC) Then, we can use this information to work out how much weight Karen is carrying at each hour:\n=> 45 - 5 = 40 => 35 - 5 = + 30 => 25 - 5 =15 => 15 - 5 =\nD) After the first hour, Karen is carrying 40 pounds.

In calculating the loss, we could use subtraction, but we would end up with an answer in pieces, not in number.\n4. The correct calculation is to divide the total amount by the original amount and obtain the loss in that way. If the loss was 8, then dividing 17 gives a result of 2.\n5.

Choices: 1. One pound 2. One half a pound 3. One third of a pound 4. One quarter of a pound\nOutput: \n1. There is actually no way for me to find quantity based on the description of the question. Therefore, I can be sure that this answer is not the best answer.\n2. Since I can say for sure there is a pound of apples on a tree, I can conclude that an Apple Tree is always 1 pound of apples.\n3. You are half a pound on an Apple Tree if you choose this answer.\n4. You get one quarter of a pound from apple trees.\n5. I like the way this question is written and I think there is a logical and straight path to the answer. This is also because I know that the question is specifically about buying apples from an apple tree.\n6.

{"idx": 444, "text": "1) First, let\u2019s find the total earning by dividing the given products (which are already known). Since 1 pair sells for $6, total $6/6 is 1, then the second one sells for $4 (6 times 4 gives us 24, so $24/2 will be 12, then 6 pairs cost $3 and 12 pairs cost $36, so the total is $60.) Now, let\u2019s find Sab\u2019s earnings. She sold 6 pairs of $3 shoes and 18 shirt pairs (24 total) which costs $6 each. The total is $24, 6/24 comes out to be 1/4 which is.25, and then 6 divided by 0.25 comes up to 24. So 24 pairs of $3 shoessell for $24 (Sab earns $24 in total). Dane sold 60 pairs of shoes, so she sold 6 shoes for $3 each, and then 54 pairs for $6 each. So 60 pairs sell for $60, divide by 60 and we\u2019ll get 1 pair costs $3. Now 18 shirt sells for $2 each, which is 1 pair sells 2 pairs for $4, so 18 pairs sell for $6 or 6 pairs are sold for $18. Then total earning is 6 plus 60 which is 66. So 66/60 comes out to be 66/40 or 100/40. We do it again and 100 is divided by 40 which is.25 so 40 divided by.25 gives 1/4 which results in 24. So Dane earned 24 pairs of shoes in total ($24). 2. This one is not as straightforward as the previous example. It is a question that asks of how much money would each of the children earn if they divided the total sum of their earning? That is, If Sab has a total of $6 and Dane has $66 then how much woud each one receive when they divide it between them? Option A is incorrect for several reasons. The first reason is that the total sum", "answer": " 27"}

The question begins by asking where to find both a vending  machine and a fount. This can lead to two potential interpretations of the question:\n1) You are looking for a place to purchase items from a vending machine and then top them off from a fountain.\n2) You are looking for the specific places where vending machines and fountains are located in the same spot (rather than the items being available individually).\n\n2. Let' s consider each of these possibilities.\n2.a) A: the main office. The main office is not typically the area with a vending machine and fountain. It is more likely to have a snack bar where food items are prepared and served and the fountain is the student area where you will find vending machines and faucets.\n2.b) A: main corridor. This can possibly mean the hallway, but not all hallways have vending machines. Even if one did, it wouldn't be found within the cafeteria as the cafeteria is typically a separate location and has its own vending machines.\n2.c) A: inside building.

One of them is option A: \"exactly 10\". This would make no sense as there is no need to play 11 or more games on either side.\n2. This leaves us with option B: \"exactly 6\".  Carla may have won exactly 6 games if she only won a couple in a row, but this is unlikely. We can deduce that either Carla won 5 or 7 games, and not exactly 6.\n3. In order to figure this out, consider the option C: \"38\". If this was the answer then Carla would have won exactly 19 games. Since we know this is not possible either, the correct answer is option D: \"19\".

Since chameleons, though not exclusively, are known for their movements and mimicry, \"ballet\" is a suitable association.\n5.

As per the previous part of the statement, we saw that Roselaen, Rosalene and Rosaleen are 3 women.

Choices: A: turtles B: dinosaurs C: pigs D: cows E: chickens\nOutput:1. There are a few ways to answer this question. One way is to narrow answers by eliminating any answers that contradict the scenario (e.g. if we are asked about animals that lay eggs, we eliminate answers that are not animals). This requires determining what the question is asking for.\n2. The first step is to understand what the animal is given as a choice by determining whether each of the answers are animals. In this example, each of the answers are not animals and therefore they cannot be considered as answers.\n3. The next is to determine whether the question is asking for animals that lay eggs or not. This can be done by checking each of the answers that were given and determining whether each of them fit this criteria.\n4. From here, it is then possible to determine whether any of the answers do not fit this criteria, and would be eliminated from our list of potential answers.\n5. In this case, one of the answers is turtles. Turtles do not lay eggs, which means they are not animals that lay eggs either, even though they are also animals.\n6. Therefore we can eliminate turtles and leave the other answers since they were all animals that are also animals that do not lay eggs.\nSo the final correct answer would be either A or E.", "answer": " 95"}

I have divided the process to three phases to keep it more focused and easily understood.\n\nPhase 1: Calculating the total number of people that attended the party.\n\nUsing the available information in the question, we can say that the total number of people in attendance must be 50, because $500 is $100 multiplied by 5.\n\nPhase2: Estimating the cost of the party.\n\nAs per given information in the question, the party cost $50 less than the total money collected (let\u2019s say this was $5600). So the cost of the party is $5600-500 = $5100.\n\nPhase3: Calculating the amount used to pay the expenses of the party\n\nWe know the party cost $5100 and the attendance was 50 people. To calculate the amount used to pay for expense, we need to multiply 5100 by the number of people who came to the party or 50 people (5100 x 50 = 25500).\n\nSo the amount used to pay expense of the party is $25500.\n\nI recommend, one of the best ways to perform such calculations is to keep a reference diagram on a piece of paper or notepad.\nIt will help you organize the information and make better decisions while solving a problem.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is $255 as per my calculations.\n\nInput: How many digits are there in the number 5,00,000,00?

What is the 'your currency' in the question?  It is clearly NOT a general currency but rather YOUR currency.  Hence, if you are asking why Mr Cohen won't accept payment, it must mean from YOU, not from everyone else.\n3. Now consider each of the given options for why Mr Cohen does not accept payment.\n4. Option A: \"he wants to trade with you\". This is incorrect because Mr Cohen does not have a specific relationship or purpose in accepting payment from YOU. A business (Mr Cohen) would probably take payments from many customers or clients whereas this option could only mean from YOU.\n5. Choice B: \"he only wants legal tender\". This is incorrect because the question asks only why Mr Cohen would not accept payment, not what he does accept it in. Therefore, this is irrelevant.\n6. Choice D: \"he takes it everywhere he goes\". This is also incorrect because it does not relate directly to payment and he is not necessarily 'offering' payments to accept payments everywhere he goes.\n7.

The airplane can hold up to a total luggage of 600 pounds but each person can carry only 5 bags which is 250 pounds. This implies that we can fit in maximum 1420 pounds in the airplane instead of 600 which means we have 820 pounds as free luggage space.\n3. There are total 550 pounds left in free luggage space which we can use again on 5 bags on each of the other 5 people and it is clear that each person can carry a maximum of 5 bags instead of 550 / 5 = 110 so that gives us a max of 550 pounds / 51 = 10 bags and 1 person.\n4.

B: What's the goal of the work? C: Who is the person doing the work?\nOutput:  I know that A is not the correct answer because it mentions they go to work, not that while they're away they spend that time doing something.\nAlso, to begin my answer, the answer has the most number of possible words.

{"idx": 510, "text": "1) The question asked is \"How much will Coco pay?\". 2) We need to understand that $10-$0.10=$9.90, because $0.10 is in kW. Hence the electricity bill when it is said to be $0.10 kW is the same when it is said to cost $10 per kBH.\nExample: Suppose if Coco's bill last month is $10/kBH, if Coco was using 2.4 kBH, that means, he used 2.4 kW (because 1 kBH=1000W), and his bill was actually 2.4 x 0.10 which comes to $0.24/kW. Now, if he used his oven for 25 hours, hence the cost would be $0.24 x 25(since the oven lasts only for 25 hours per month) which comes out to be $6/month, and not $1000 for a year, which is what was intended at first. $1000 would be if Coco used his oven for a whole year.\n3.

We have been told that there are 25 different kinds of rock in the canyon's strata, but that does not necessarily mean each layer is made up of a single kind of rock. In some places, two layers may be separated by a single layer that contains multiple kinds of rock.\n2) Now, we can consider the remaining option choices more closely. We can eliminate \"A. Two kinds\" because a single layer usually contains only one kind of rock. And we can also eliminate \"C. Nine\" since it only specifies a total of nine rock types being present in the strata, but no indication of how many layers are needed to accomplish this.\n3) After the initial elimination steps, what remains are the following options: \"1. Seven\", \"2. Nine\", \"3. Ten\", \"4. 11\".\n4) By performing an exhaustive combinatorial analysis we can identify that the most logical choice is \"3. Ten\".\n5) To confirm this answer, we should go by the example provided by the question. If we consider a single layer of rock to be made up of only one kind, then the first layer of rock is sandstone. We also know that half of the rest are sandy, and that half of the rest is unspecified.

Carla would be taking 3 trips, as she needs to drive from her house to the grocery, from the grocery to pick up her kiddies and back again, and once more to drop them off at soccer and bring them back home.\n2. There is a simple formula for calculating number of gallons based on miles, gasoline pricing, and gasoline mileage. In this scenario, there are 4 variables: mileage, gas price, gas mileage and miles travelled.\n3. We can eliminate one variable at a time. Carla's car get's 25 miles per 1 gallon. Her total gas mileage is about 25+12+12+8 = 49 miles = approx. 0.0125 gallons per mile. Therefore, the gas cost per one mile is approx $2.50/$0.0123 = 203 cents.\n4. Next, we can calculate the total distance covered in the trips. All the numbers and variables are on the left hand side of the formula. In three trips, the total distance is 8 miles + 12 miles + 12 + 6 = 40 miles.\n5. We've eliminated 2 variables and can substitute them by the total result of the calculation. It gives us about 40+40+40 = about 120 miles per trip. So we have 3 trips and about 360 total miles covered.\n6. The next 3 variables are on the same side of the equation. Gas cost per mile is substituted with it's result. We can leave gasoline mileage.\n7. By substituting these 2 variables we get the total cost of gasoline = about $2.50*0.0121$*0.01.\nThis gives us the final result of $3.06.\nSo the final value is $3.06\n\nInput: What does a frugal witch do with her broom?

That leaves 30 minutes left where it says Mack was working at a rate of 30 min each page. We subtracted 1 page from 30min = 29 minutes left. Mack finished the page in 30 seconds.

A involves jumping, and jumping takes less time than walking. D. A is done by jumping, and jump can be done for more time than walking.\nOutput: 1: A can be done for more than 6 minutes in advance of B, because you are able to do either A or B with more or less time, but you can never exceed 6 minutes.\n2. B is more difficult than B, because you cannot exceed 6 minutes and you will still be exhausted and cannot continue with exercise B.\n3. A involves jumping and the jumping takes more time than walking. Walking takes less time and the less the time, the more you can do and the more benefits of it. Thus exercise A involves jump, the jump is a more efficient method than walking and jumps gives you more exercising time and this is why you get more benefits for exercise A than exercise B.\n4. D is not correct because, you can't exceed 6 minutes and in each exercise, the more you walk or do the more exercise you provide, and that should be your priority.\nSo, the answer to the question is A: A can be done more on time in advance of B.\n\nInput: The word spheroid is closest to a ball which is shaped A. a 3D shape B. symmetrical C. circular D. smooth \nOutput: In math, a spheroid is the shape of a ball.

Option A: The numbers given add up to 9. But if we have to add 3 times the votes for the unicorn to the votes for the witch, then we're looking at a total of 24 (+3x 7), not 9.\n4. Option D: We can eliminate D because we cannot say that the number of witch cake votes is equal to or greater than 7 since we know it is lesser. Since D is incorrect, A,B,C,E are the remaining options. \n5. Option B: We don't know how many votes are cast total but we do know that the witch cake got 7 votes, and 3 times the number of unicorn cakes, which we're asked to find. Therefore, option B is incorrect.\n6. Option E: Since we know that the two times the number of uniocorn cakes is 24, the total votes must be either 24 or 9, since any number that is in excess of that cannot be greater than 7. As a result, the total votes must either be 24 or 12. However, we know that the sum of the votes for the three cakes equals 42. But it cannot be that 42 is more than 24 because a total of 42 is impossible. Hence E is incorrect.\n7.

The presence of another person in the room will not always increase or decrease the time taken to complete a task.

{"idx": 548, "text": "1/9/2021 1:31 PM \n1. It was a given that Tom was renovating a house.\n2. The question is asking how long each room of the house took, therefore, we need to know how many bedrooms there are and the total area in which the renovation will be completed.\n3. Tom says that renovating each bedroom took him 4 hours, so we can write 4, meaning that each bedroom will take 1/4 of the total time to renovate\n4. The question also states that for every bedroom, 50% more time (double) is needed for the kitchen. That means that kitchen takes 5/4 of the total allotted time to complete the house.\n5. We also know the total time it took Tom to renovate the house (4*3 + 50% * 1), which was 18 hours.\n6. Finally, we can also use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the square root of 18 (18\u221a2 = 4), so we can conclude by writing 5*4 = 20 hours.\n7. The living room required 2*4 = 8 hours. This means that we could write 4(number of bedrooms) + 8(the living room) = 20 hours as the total renovation time (the number of hours needed to renovate the entire house)\n8. In the final answer, we can ignore all other variables (B - E) to understand that the total number of hours Tom spent on the house was 20. \nSo the final answer of how long it took Tom to renovatethe house is 4*3 + 1.5(the kitchen) + 2(the living room) + the total time = 20", "answer": " 54"}

If each dog attacked one pig, how many pigs were there at the end? Choices: 1. 9 pigs 2. 3 pigs 3. 10 pigs 4. 7 pigs 5. none\nOutput: As this problem is quite basic, let us begin with the basic math concepts. How many pigs can there be in a total of 10 pigs? There are 10 total pigs. How many pigs did the first dog attack? Then how many pigs are left? If each dog attacks one pig, then if a dog attacks 10 pigs or so, there would be 9 left and then 7 pigs would be left. And if a dog attacks 3 pigs, then there would be 7 pigs and 3 left.\nThen how can you solve the problem of how many pigs were at the end and then how they were? There were 12 (each of 3 dogs plus the first dog) dogs guarding the total of ten pigs. There were 10 pigs at the beginning, since the dog is guarding them. Thus, if three of the dogs attacked the ten pigs, then there were 9 pigs left. But, since both the first dog and the three guard dogs attacked the pigs, then it must be that there were only 7 pigs with the last dog in the end.\n\nSo 7", "answer": " 2000"}

How many apples does she have to give each child so that everyone is happy?\nOutput:Roberta has 4 apples which she wishes to divide equally between her 5 children, with each one receiving an equal share.\nLet's consider every child\u2019s share.\nCase 1- For the first child, Roberta can give 1 apple and 3 apples still remain.\nCase 2- For the second child, Roberta can not give less then 2 which makes 3 apples remain.\nCase 3- for the third child Roberta can give 4 which leaves nothing. For all 3 cases, the children are happy because they still have their fair shares.\nSo, by subtracting from 4(number of apples) for each of the 5 children, we're left with an equal amount after subtraction.\nSo the final distribution would be -\nChid 1 - 1\nChid 2 - 3\nChid 3 - 4\nChid 4 - 3\nChild 5 - 0\nSo the final solution would be -\nChild 1 - 1 apple\nChild 2 - 3 apples\nChild 3 - 4 apples\nChild4 - 3 apples,\nChild 5\n\nInput: What might someone who is thirst be doing if they are in the desert?

The information provided indicates that Lilith was trying to sell her water bottle at $2 (original cost), but was unable to due to their regular price of $1.85. Therefore, she reduced her price to $1,85.\n3. This information allows us to eliminate any option that involves selling her water at more than $1.85, such as D: $2.00 which is greater than $1.8.\n4. This information also allows us to eliminate any options that involve selling her water at less than $1.8, since she already tried selling it at twice the price.\n5.

This makes sense intuitively, but it's still incorrect grammatically.\n\n6. Lastly, look at choice A:\n\nA. I arrive\n\nIt just doesn't make as much sense as the other 2 choices.

Other forces like gravity can also cause a person to lose equilibrium but wind isn't among them.\n2: Falling can cause a person to be thrown off balance. It can also cause other reactions like fear or injury, which could impair a person's ability to maintain balance. However, the term falling isn't necessarily restricted to trips and falls.

Since Dali is Picasso's distant relative, he shouldn't have created 9 separate paintings that he signed by himself; at best it means that when he signed other people's paintings, he made those paintings worth $9 more than they previously were.

Here, a pepperoni slice refers to a single circular slice that resembles the shape of a pepperoni.\n4. It starts with 40 slices and Lard cuts the pizza in half, but only keeps one slice for himself so there are 20 slices left.

Therefore, if the person saw 13 rabbits in the park, then when seven more rabbits were to be added, then that number must equal 8/3 of 13, which equals 8. Thus, the correct sentence is \"If seven more rabbits were also added to the thirteeen in the cage, then the number of rabbits would be 8/3 the number of the rabbit the person saw\"\n6) If the above statement were to be rephrased, then it will read:\n\"If seven more rabbits (1st Group of Rabbits: 13) were added to the thirteenth (3rd Group of Rabbits) already in the cage, they (the sum of the first 3 groups of rabbits) would be 8/13 the number of rabbit seen in the park\"\n7) By rearranging and keeping the order of the groups in this situation the question can be rewritten as: \"if seven more rabbits (first group-13) are added to the cage, then they will make up (remainder in third group-13) which equals 8/13 of the sum of rabbits seen in the park\".\n8) Hence, the right answer is \"If seven more Rabbits were added to the thrity-one already in the cage.\"\nSo the final answer could be either B or D.\n\nInput: What are ants attracted to?

This means that Rose spent $350 which was not equal to Mary. Therefore, Rose bought the basketball cards for $300 as a second present.\nSo Rose bought a pair of sunglasses at $50 each, a pair of jeans costing $100, a pair of shoes for $150 and 2 decks of basketball cards for $350.\n6. In the initial scenario, Mary and Rose bought 2 pairs of sunglass, 1 pair of jeans, 1 pair of shoes and 2 decks  of basketball cards.\n7. The total cost of the 2 pairs of sunnies was $580.

After driving 5 miles to the doctor appointment, he has traveled 5 miles. In total, he has drive 5+5+15+10 which is 40.

Choices: A: 1 B: 2 C: 3 D: 6 E: 7\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the minimum number of times someone would have to repeat a word if they wanted to say different words after repeating a certain number of times.\n2) In this case, it is the word good that must be repeated a certain time before they can say morning (or any other word).\n3) First, we consider options D, E, and F. D states that a person would have to say 'good' six times before changing to'morning', but the text specifies'minimum'. This means option 'D' is not correct as the question asks about the fewest number of times you would need to say \"good\" before changing to \"morning\". Choosing option E would also be incorrect since it would require saying 'good' seven times to get to'morning'.\n4) Therefore, the remaining options are A: 1 and B: 2. Option A has been eliminated since it specifies'minimum', which matches the question.\n5) Option B can also be selected because it suggests repeating the word 'good' twice in order to reach'morning'.\n\nSo the final answer would be B: 2\n\nInput: What is the value of X in the equation: 15*X - 3 = 1?

Let x = original amount (x \u2208 $)\n3. Let u = amount spent (u \u2208 $)\n4. Let v = amount left (v \u2208 $)\n5. We have x + u = v\n6. Plugging in numbers, x + u = 51\n7. x + u = 61\n8. So, Isabel is expected to get $61\n9. Now, we need to answer the following question:\n10. \"If Isabel has $61 left, how much did she have at first?\"\n11.

As the question says the pool needs 110 tiles to be completely, we can conclude that 100 blue tiles and 10 red tiles are already given. \n3. Since each blue tile is 6 times as common as a red tile, we can say that the total pool requires 6 times the number of red tiles to make up the missing 10 tiles.\n4. We can use long division to calculate this.\n5. If 100 total tiles are common pool, then 36 tiles red tiles are required for total pool and we do not require 10 tiles more.\n6.

The question starts with a statement that the shop offers smartphones (A) which cost $300, personal computers (B) which cost $500 more compared to smartphones (A), and advanced tablets (C) for the sum of the two other items.\n3. Since A (smartphones) are being compared to B (personal computers), 500/300=1.66, which implies that 1.66 personal computers cost as much as 1 smartphone.\n4. Since A (smothphones) are being added to B (personal computer), 2A+B =500. That is, a total of 2 smartphones and 1 personal computer would cost 500.\n5.

The question asks about the number of shells Shara had before vacation, as well as the number of shells she found each day during vacation and the total number of shells she had afterwards.\n2. Let us substitute the values given in the question\n3. The total number of shells before vacation = 20 shells\n4. On vacation, it was found that she found 5 shell every day. This shows that she found 5 new shells every day. This means each day it was +5, -5, +5, -5 +10 shells and now she has +5, -5 +10, +5, -20 +10 = 18 shells\n5. Now after the vacation she found 6 shells in day 4. This means there are 6 + 5 + 10 + 5 + 5 + 6 = 32 shells.

Now, when John and his dog run together, John runs at the speed of 14 miles an hour, and his dog at the rate of 6 miles an hour.\n7. So, when John is alone, he runs only 5 miles an hour.\n\n8.

{"idx": 739, "text": "1. The Question provides us with several numbers that are unknown in this problem. Now, we can't just randomly guess out of the blues. So, let's start by plugging the known information and equations. For the first, known, number we can say that 100 feet divided by 10 is 10, so Tom started with 100-100/10 feet. Ben worked a fifth of what Tom already had done, or 100-4/10, or 96 feet and 4/10 of the fence. So, after Ben, Tom left 96 4/10 feet to be done by Billy, his second friend.\n2. Now, Billy covered 25 feet, and Johnny did 667/3 or 223 feet. After Johnny finished, there are just 63 feet and 4/3 of a foot to go.\n3. This problem was actually written badly, because while I wrote 63 feet and some part of 3/3 of a foot, Tom left behind a 1/3 of a foot. That's why I'm going to have to plug these values in here:\n4. First: Ben whitewashed 96 feet and four-tenths of a foot (96.4). Second: Billy whitewashed 25 feet (25). Third: Johnny whitewashed 66.7 feet (66.7).\n5.

(32 = 4 x 8 = 4 x [4 x 4]) \n\n```\n                                                                                                              4                                                                                        4 x [4 x (4 x (4 x X))]\n```\n\n3) The question then goes to find the difference between Anya's total and Andrea's, to get the exact difference between them. This can be solved using the formula: [4 x (X - n)] = 16 - [4 x n]\n\n```\n4 x [4 x X] - n = 16 - n\n  16 - n = (4 x 8) - n\n        16 - n = 32 - n\n          32 = 32 - 32\n```\n\n4) From the third part, we know that \"Anya has exactly 4 x 4 x 4 erasers and Andrea has 4 x 8 erasers\" so the actual answer to the question is 16 - 32 = -16. We can conclude that Anya has (16 times as many eraser as Andrea) - 16 (eraser) = (4 x 4 x4) - 16 erasers.\n5) If we look back at the first part, which stated Anya has \"4 x 4 x (4 x 4)\" erasers, we can see she has a total of 16 x 16 x", "answer": " 12"}

{"idx": 756, "text": "1. We can set up the given problem as two equations with two unknowns. Note that we do not know the total time Tom was running nor the average speed Tom covered.\n2. The equation representing the swimming time would be t = 2hrs and the equation representing the running time would be t = x/2hrs.\n3. If the total time Tom was swimming was 2hrs, then the average speed at which Tom swum would be 2 miles per hour = 2hrs/2mi/hr.\n4. If the half the running time Tom spent running was 4hrs, then the total time Tom was actually running would be 4hrs*4mi/hr = 16mi/hr.\n\n5. Therefore, the equation for the running time would be x = 16hrs/2mi-hr = 8mi-hrs.\n6. Let us substitute the appropriate values: (2hrs, 4hrs) in terms of the unknown time (t1, t2) so that the expressions simplify:\n\n1) x = t1\n\n2) t1 = 2hrs\n\n7.

He can buy 50 pound bags of flours for $20 (bags \u00d7 50 = 50 \u00d7 $20= $1000; bags = pounds/50, pounds = $20/50= $4/pound = dollars/50, $/pound).\n3.

{"idx": 761, "text": "158\n2. The question provides the details of the party and then asks how much money Susan will spend on food for it.\n3. According to the question, there are three main components to the dinner: potatoes, salt, and an unspecified recipe.\n4. To determine how much salt will be needed, we need to first determine how much of the saltless recipe will provide 1 teaspoons of salt, i.e. how much salt the recipe will demand. Thus, we have:\nsalt consumed per 2 servings = 1 teaspooun/2 = 1/2 teaspooun =.5 teaspooun\n5. Combining this with the details of the meal i.e. 4 potatoes per batch, 1/2 teaspoun of salt per batch, we will need:\nsalt x 30 batches  = 15 teaspoouns (the word teaspoouns is used twice here, but is not wrong)\n6. The question indicates that each batch of food will each require a cup of potatoes. This means that each potato will need to be divided into approximately 2.5 cups. This may be approximated as 2.625 cups (since 1 cup = 8 ounces, a potato weighs approximately 16 ounces).\n7. Hence, Susan will need:\npotatos x 30 batch = 812.5 potatos\n8. With these calculations, Susan will have to spend $2 to get the potatoes for the 30 guests (cost for one potato is $0.10), and $42 (the cost for two containers of salt is $2 times 21 teaspouns) to complete her meal.\n9. Thus, Susan will spend a total of $42.10 on food.

Out of the given options, there are only two that are logical and possible options:\n3. \"16 kidders\" is the answer option. We can infer this option from the fact that for each 2 kidders, one goes tubing and the other goes rafting. Therefore, for 24 kidders out of 40, 1 rafter would go tubing and the other would go rafting.\n4. The remaining kidders that don't either go tubing or rafting, means that 8 kidders are left.\n5. 24 kiddies go out of 40 total kiddies. Out of 24, 16 go tubing; 8 - rafting.\n6. This leaves us with 16 kiddies that go tubing and 8 kiddies that go rafting. We can write this statement as: (16 + 8) = 24. Subtracting 8 from both sides and multiplying to get the kiddies that go just tubing (16 + 24 = 39, (8/2) * 16 = 24.\n7. In short, to figure out how many of the kiddies that joined the rafting trip also went tubing, multiply (16 + 16 = 32). To figure out how many of those 32 also went tubing, subtract (8*16 = 128). Which is 128 - 16 = 112 remaining kiddies (excursion) that went tubing but rafting.\n8. Finally, to bring it down to the actual kiddies we multiply (40*128 = 5120) and thus arrive at 16 + 112 = 128.

However, the child's climb involved an emotional, rather than physical, ascent, so we should look for an appropriate metaphor.\n3. Option E: the ground appears to be a fitting metaphor for the \"top\" of the climb as a place that is lower than the rest, so it is the correct answer. Although there might be a more logical or literal choice, this choice best fits the context and language used.\nSo the final Answer is E: the ground\n\nInput:\"Once upon a time there was a small forest where...\" \"One day a little witch...\" \"And she would scare every...\" \"Sometimes she caught...\" \"Once she caught a beautiful butterfly.\" \"She kept it...\" \"But the butterfly...\" \"Then she changed the...\" \"And she set it", "answer": " 4"}

We can simplify the problem and consider Zion's friends as Z and X for ease of reference, but this does not affect the answer.\n3. The given information includes the fact that the base of the triangular houses made by Zion and his friends have a measurement of 4 centimeters (40 cm) and the height is also 20 cm.\n4. The given details in the question also include the fact that a triangular house of cards has a total area of (1/2) * width * height by definition. This can be used to answer the question.\n1. We can calculate the area using Pythagoras Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), where c is the height of each house, and a + b equals the total horizontal area for each house.\n2. Since the height for each house is 20 cm, and the base length is 40 cm, then the height for the two triangular shaped houses is 2 x 20 = 40 cm.\n3. Therefore we can simplify the equation as (1/2) (40 cm + 40 cm + 8 cm), which is roughly equivalent to (1/2) 100cm\u00b2. In other words, the area of the two triangular-shaped houses made by Zion's friends is 50 square cm.\n4. This information can be used to compute the total area of all triangular-shaped cards made by Zion and this requires the area of Zion's card to be added to the area of the cards made by Zion' s friends.\n5.

Lets consider the different quantities of food eaten by the three dogs and figure out the total amount of food each eats daily. From the three quantities, we can \ndeduce that the total amount of food that the three dogs eat is: {1.5 + 2 * 2} = 7.5 cups\n4. Now, out of the daily ration the first dog eats 0.5 cups, the second dog eats 1cups\nand the third dog eats (1 + 2/2 = 3) cups.

Choices:  (1) B (2) D (3) C (4) A\nOutput: 1 (1) The octopus will be near the ocean floor. It is more natural for the octopus to be in water near the ocean floor since they primarily inhabit the floor of the ocean, not above it. 2 One thing you could do when you see an octopus is try to catch it. However, this would not be practical. Octopuses are very quick and can disguise themselves with ink in the event that they feel attacked. So you could try to catch it but a better course of action would be to just simply observe it. 3 You could try to find a friend to help you. However, if their is a person nearby the octopus might mistake them as a potential predator. Even if they don't they might attack the person instead of you since the octopus is territorial and highly defensive. So you could find a friend,", "answer": " 10"}

This means 28 birds are being fed each week by the chick in the feeders which is why the problem stated in the beginning says \"Every week, he has to **REFRESH** the emptied feeds\".

Check to make sure you've read the full question and understand what is being asked. If not, reread the question until you are comfortable with it.\n\nAfter reading the question, your next task is to isolate one option as the 'correct' choice. For instance, let's say the question reads 'How many times is 3 multiplied by 7?' and the multiple choice options are 'twice', 'thrice', 'triple' or'multi'. Now, how do we know how many times seven times three is? We could do this ourselves by multiplying 7 by 3, but why work so hard? This is where elimination comes in. Say we go through the options given and come across 'twice'. We can eliminate any choice with 'twice' immediately, making 'thrice' and 'triple' the only remaining choices. This is a method of elimination.\n\nTo eliminate any one choice in a multiple choice question, you simply need to identify which option will not work given a set of information. Remember to always check for punctuation before making your final choice.\n\nWhen there are multiple questions asked in a paragraph, remember to answer every question that is asked. In our last case, let's say there were three questions asked in a row. The first two were 'what is 3 times 7?', 'twice it is', and the last one was not given explicitly. Our job is to figure out, using the previous two choices we eliminated, which choice would suffice 'twice'.\n\nFor this round we will have ten questions", "answer": " 2"}

{"idx": 807, "text": "1. The question begins by stating that an item was priced at $250 but was later on sale for 20% off, which makes the sale price $125.\n2. Considering the sale, the question continues by saying that 10% sales or 'use' tax was added to the total cost of purchase. This indicates that Donna's purchase was subject to a use tax.\n3. Use tax is generally defined as a 'consumption' or'sales' tax paid on the purchase of goods that were purchased in the buyer's home state but were originally taxed during the time they were purchased elsewhere. Since this use tax is applied to purchases in your home state, it means that Donna is subject to a use tax because she lives in the same state where the vase was purchased.\n4. The question provides that the porcelain vases in the store costed $250 but later went on sale for 10% and after Donna paid the 10% sales use tax, for a total purchase price of $137.50.\n5. Let's put the information above in a table to help visualize it.\nState          Total Price                State Use Tax  Purchase Price\nPrior to Sale: $250.00        $200.00 (0%)     $250. 00\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSale: 10% off               $125.00 (0.25%)       $137 50.00\n\n6. So as per the question, how much does Donna pay in total? It has to be $137. 50, since the combined total of the total price before the sale and subsequent sales tax is $250, and the sum has to equal her total purchase price of $277.50. Thus, Donna pays a grand total of $13750.\nSo the final Answer is $14000\n\nInput: What is the value of the following expression if the first term is substituted by the second and the result multiplied with the third? 4(5+8)*6\nOutput:-\n1.

The easiest way to go about this is to assume at each number of 11, and divide 41 by each.\n4 To find the total thrown we go back to the formula 22 + 13 + 11 + 11 = 67, which is how much candy they collected combined. This must have been the total thrown.\n5 This leaves us with only one question\n6 What did Carlos collect? This can be confirmed because he collects half as much as Julie, so either Julie collected 11 or Carlos found 22. Because Carlos only collected his piece twice as much as Stan collected, we must say his finding was 22. This means Julie collected 10.\n7 Using this information, we can solve the question. Stan collected 13 less candy than Tabitha. 22-13=9\n8 Tabitha collected 18 candy.\n9 Therefore their total is 41+9+18=78.", "answer": " 72"}

This implies that the cost of the discount clinic is much lower than that of regular doctors.\n2) Then the next part asks how much money he saved in comparison to the normal doctor\u2019s visit. This implies that while the cost of the discounT clinic is lower than a normal doctor\u2019s visit, it is not equal to the cost of a regular doctor\u2019s visit.\n3) Hence, we can eliminate options A and B, which cannot represent the cost of the discounter clinic.\n4) Option C is false because Tom is getting a cheaper doctor\u2019s visit at the discount clinic but needs two visits instead of one. Therefore, the cost of the disconder clinic is actually higher than the regular doctor.\n5) Option D is also false because the correct answer must be less than $200, not more.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is option E which states that Tom would save $140.\nSo the final answe is E: $140\n\nInput: If you have too much money, it's considered what? Choices: A: a bad thing B: extra cash C: a lot of green D: a surplus E: a fortune\nOutput: 1: The question states \"If you have too much money.\" This implies that there is a maximum amount of money that you can have which would then be categorized as too much.\n2: The next part states \"It's considered what?\". This implies a classification of too much money, which would then be considered a good thing or a bad thing.\n3: There are two ways in which this might be classified. There might be a specific maximum amount of money which would be considered the ideal amount. That would mean that having too much money is bad.\n4: However, there might also be no specific maximum amount of money that would be ideal for having. Meaning that this question is asking instead if a small excess of money is viewed as a good thing or bad thing.\n5: The most suitable answer to this question is 'E: a fortune' because a 'fortune' would imply excess wealth without any limit. Therefore, extra wealth would generally be considered positive.\nSo the final answ is E: a fortune", "answer": " 80"}

With the information given, we can solve for the final total. If the menu had prices of $16 and $14 per meal, adding the two menu prices would equal $6 + 6 = $12 for two meals.\n3. James' friend paid half, or $6, of the meal cost and James paid the remaining half, or $6. Hence, \"His friend pays the tip for half the meal, and James pays the tip plus his half of the bill.\"\n4. The total bill amount is $20 and James and his friend split this expense equally and paid the total amount of the dinner bill including the tip. We can deduce that James paid $5 for the meal and the total cost was $12 plus 20% ($2). This means James paid $15 with a total bill of $20.\n5. Therefore, James paid $15 and his friend paid $5, and they added the total tip cost.\nSo the final solution is B: $15\n\nInput: What kind of plant is not a houseplant?

From above facts, we can also say that tammy eats 4 pickle slices, so Tammy eats 4 more pickle slices than Sammy. Based on this knowledge, we may answer the question that Ron can't eat 6 pickle slices. This conclusion does not take into account Sammy and Tammy's combined total of pickle slices being 16 segments. Based on this knowledge we may assume that Ron eats 8 pickle slices.\n3. One way to think of this problem is as follows: \"If Sammy has N pickle slices in his pantry and Tammy has N pickle pieces (2x more than Samny's) and Ron pickles, then Ron has (N/4) pickle slices.\"\n4. We may also assume that the question is asking for the average amount of pickle slices that the kids eat.

{"idx": 859, "text": "1. The question wants to know, \"how many bars of candy Mark ate, if he took more bars of candy than are strictly recommended by the suggested intake of added sugar for men?\"\n2. Based on our assumption, we can say that Mark took approximately 10 bars of candy. As the question mentions that Mark took more than the suggested number of bars of candy and also exceeded the recommended intakes of added sugar by 50%, we can assume he took around 15 bars.\n3. Mark consumed 2500,25 = 104,5 calories from candy. Mark took more than the recommended intake of 150 calorie of added sugars from candy. Therefore, the excess 100 calories are the result of the intake candy. We can say that Mark exceeded the recommended intak 0f added sugar by 150 - 100 = 50% or 50/100= 0.5\n4. According to the question 25 = 0.025 and 5% = 0.05. We can say that 5% of the calories of added sugar in the candy was 0.02 + 0.02 * (1.5/100) = 0.035 calories. So the percentage of added sugars in candy is 0.03/ 2500 = 0.00125.\n5. As mentioned in question \"Then he bought some bars of chocolate which had 25 (calories of added sugar each)\" in the question, we know that he consumed approx 25 calories from each bar. So we can assume that he consumed 256 calories of added sugar from each bar. And we know that 15 bars of candy = 256 and 50% exceed of added sugars. So we can say that Mark ate 254 bars of chocolate.\n6. As mentioned in question, \"It is recommended that men take no more than 10 bars of added sugar daily.\" Now adding calories from bars of candy gives us the total number of bars Mark ate, which is 254(calories from candy) +1", "answer": " 7"}
{"idx": 860, "text": "1) The first step is to determine how many gummy bears will be manufactured per minute. Since the factory manufactures 3 gummy bears per minute, there will be 100 packets of gummy bears each containing 15 gummy bears each.\n2) A gummy bear factory can manufacture enough gummy bear packages in 60 minutes. Here, the value of 2 minutes, 20 minutes and 20 packages is calculated.\n3) Then we can see that \"It will take about 15 minutes to make enough cookies to fill 50 minutes\". This phrase means that it will take 30 minutes to make enough cookies for 60 cookies.\n4) So after 15 minutes of production, there will be enough gummy bears for 80 cookies. It takes 1 minute per gummy bear. After making enough gummy bears, there will be 850 cookies.\nSo the final solution is (2 minutes, 2 minutes)\n\nInput: At which store do people buy their food for parties? Choices: 1.

A grocery store and a convenience store both sell food for parties, but a convenience store typically offers a smaller selection of items for convenience and grocery store and convenience store don\u2019t have the selection of large items for big events like parties.\n3. A bakery often offers limited food items for parties, and doesn\u2019t offer the same convenience as a grocery or convenience store.\n4.

He then donates 20 coins to charity. He donates half of the remaining coins to his brother. He triples the coins he has. He donates another 11 coins.\n3) Since he starts with 80 bit co ins, we can subtract the 20 coins he donates to charity.  Now Jake has 60 bit coins.\n4) He then donates just over 30 coins, giving his brother 15 bit coins. So now Jake has 45 bit coins.\n5) He continues by tripling his coins so now he has 135 bit coins. ( 130-20)\n6) He then donates 11 bit coins, bringing him to 124 bit coins. (15-20)\n7) Adding all the coins together gives 126 coins. (185-15)\n8) Thus, he finishes with 126 bit coins.

This means that she will accumulate all the fees she has been collecting over a period of time.\n4.The choices given are $5, $8, and $4. Margaux collects different amounts from each person but she collects the same amount every day. This implies that the amount she collects from her brother and cousin over a period of time is double that of the amount she collects every day from her friend. This indicates that she collects $8 per day from her brother, and $4 per day from her cousin.\n5.The sum of $8 per day from brother and $4 per day for cousin can be written as 8 + 4 = 12 per day.

{"idx": 925, "text": "1. It is evident that the solution lies in estimating the time required to complete the task of washing all the laundry. The question does not refer to a specific load, so we take the assumption that the time required to complete one load of laundry is the same regardless. \n2. We can consider the time in a cycle, which usually refers to the operation of a machine in one go. For example, the wash cycle refers to the time it takes for a machine to complete the entire wash operation, from setting in the wash load to closing the drum and signifying that the process is complete.\n3. Therefore we cannot take the first cycle time (i.e. the time taken to wash a single load) as it is inclusive of multiple stages (setting the load, transferring the load, spinning the load etc.) that could potentially all take place at once.\n4. We can eliminate option C, because the time required to complete 3 entire wash cycles exceeds the time needed for 3 complete wash cycles. Also, the given time frame (8 loads) does not correspond to 3 loads.\n5. Similarly, we cannot take option D because it requires 8 entire cycles which is greater than the time required to complete all 8 wash loads in the given time frame. \n6. As for option A, it is a valid choice but is not accurate. This is because a set of 8 wash loads would usually encompass multiple cycles in a domestic setting - in fact, with an average-sized washing machine it would require at least 5 cycles to complete 8 loads. Thus, option A is inaccurate.\n7. The correct option is B: 6 hours, which is achieved by taking each hour to complete 2 wash cycles and then combining this result to account for all 8 loads.\nSo the final result is 6 hours\n\nInput: I see you were looking for a way to be able to keep your home in a safe way.

So out of 21 working hours, the first one was working 12 hours, the second one was working for 10 hours and the last one for just 7 hours. 2. Since Julia had to finish her day earlier, we know that she was working only for six hours.\n3. For 6 hours, she can serve 42 customers. Add that to 12 and 10, we'd get 26 + 42 +10 = 88. 4.

Therefore, we know that Malcom and Mark gave away a total of 28 baseball cards between them.\n\n  Then, we can easily calculate how many cards Malcom would have left over. Since, both Brandon and Malcom had 20 cards each to start with, Mark has given away 'half' of Malcom's original cards (which amounts to 14 cards).\n  Thus, Malcom has half as many cards as he had before he gave away half of his cards, which means he has 10 cards left.\n So the final answer is A : 10\n\nInput: When you're learning a new language, it helps if what?

If she wants her deck to be 20 feet long, how many boards can be used?\nOutput:  In this question, we first define that the length of board is L=3F or 4F or 5F\n\nIn this problem, there is a 1 foot difference between each length of board.  So 1 foot * difference = 3 feet\n\nThere are 3F boards, therefore we use 3F * difference = 8 feet  That means that Jane has 8F worth of boards that are different in board length.\n\n30F + 5F + 2F = 38F == 20F (or exactly 20F)\n\nThere are 5 8-foot pieces plus 3 1-foot-long pieces. One 20-foot deck requires four 18-foot boards, so if we can account for what\u2019s left, then we can determine how many boards she has left and how many 8-foot boards she has in addition to the remaining 4 1-foot boards.\n\nWe have 11 left but we need 8 - 4 = 3 or 3 8-foot boars left.\n\nSo the final answer for this question is: there are 3 8-feet board can be used. So the final answer  is 3 8' board\n\nInput: It costs $7 to shovel a quarter-acre lot. How many quarters?\nOutput: The cost is 7 to shovel \"quarter acre of lot\". And we have three options.

Choices: \n1. Fix it\n2: Leave it alone\n3. Painting it\n4: Make it not broken\n5: Cleaning it\nOutput: 1) In order to fix a fountain it's being broken, something must be done to repair it.\n2) To leave something 'Alone' is to cease from making changes, but a broken fountain will not do this - it will need fixing in order to stop being broken, something will need to be done to repair it's state to no longer be broken.\n3) Painting something is not directly relevant to a broken fountain - a broken fountain would not be painted, unless it had previously been, and needed repainting.\n4) 'Make it not broken' is another non-relevant answer because it implies something has to be done. Just by looking at this question, we can see that something must be done to fix it.\n5) 'Cleaning' something implies that it must be dirty, but a broken fittings wouldn't be dirty because it wouldn't be running. This makes this answer incorrect.\nTherefore, the best answer is 1, 2, and 4, as these options are the only ones where something is being done.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is 1, \n```\n\n##### Additional tests:\n\nIn this section, I will test the NLP model I developed by making it answer multiple choice questions that I wrote at random.

{"idx": 942, "text": "1.\\tThe question presents a scenario where Jean has grandchildren and is giving them card gifts, with the gifts consisting of two cards per year and $80 in either card.\n2. The initial wording of the question does not provide specific conditions on when she is buying the cards, nor does it state the number of cards she purchases in total.\n3. To address the ambiguity, it is assumed that Jean buys exactly two cards per grandchild every year, as it would be unlikely for her to buy 2 and a 1/2 for example.\n4. In addition, the amount of $80 is only given for each of two cards so Jean is only giving $80 to each grandchild in total, per year.\n5. Therefore, Jean would give $160 in total to her three grandchildren each year.\nSo the final score is $240  / 3  = $80\n\nInput: What can a person wear and do for a hobby? Choices: 1.

The two weeks are considered individually, so the second week's sales are to be calculated as if the week prior did not occur.\n3.) The first line of the question reveals that the original fish that the fishmonger had was 50 kg.\n4.) The second line tells us that after the first week, he had a total of 150 kg to sell.\n5.) We need to find the formula to estimate this in the future as the fishmonger continues to sell fresh fish week after week.\n6.) To estimate this, we use a multiplication formula, which states that a:b = a x b. Here, a = initial amount of fish and b = fish sold per week.\n7.) The multiplier that was used at the beginning of the week in this case was 3. We take this and multiply it by the initial 50 kg. This gives us (3 x 50 = 150).\n8.) After this first week of 50 kg of fish sold, the remaining amount available to sell is 100 kg.\n9.) Thus, the total amount of fish available for 2nd week sales is 100 + 150 = 250 kg.\n10.) As per week 2, the total amount of 250 kg is available to sell, and this time he had a multiplier of 6 (instead of the 3 given at the beginning of week 1).\n11.) This time, the multiplier is multiplied by the total amount of fish he had to sell, which is 250. This gives a total of 250 x 6 = 1500 kg.\n12.)

We know that each square that you cut from the large square is indeed a smaller one and the process is repeated over and over again. 12 inches is 2 feet and the sheet is of dough and not paper. It is a large square. For the same dough sheet I could cut into square of 2\" by 2\" inches as well. If I cut 24 pieces from the large piece of dough what will the size of each piece be? The size will be 0.5 feet. 12 is greater than 6 in a way that they can be added in such a manner. To make square biscuits out of that large sheet, each biscuit has to be a perfect square with sides equal in each other. So the dimension of each biscuit will have to be 6 inches. So how many biscuits can I cut from the 6 feet dough sheet? The answer is 12.

Since there is a fish option available, \"D: meat\" cannot be the answer, and we can further deduce that the answer is \"A: Salmon\".\n2. \"F: cheese\" does not make logical sense, as an alligator would not typically eat cheese, making it the first logical contender to be disqualified in step 1.\n3. While \"B: Pizza\" is also not likely for an alligator to eat, there was no definitive statement that Pizza is definitely not an option, so it can be eliminated using the 1st step's logic, and thus, \"A: Salmon\" ends up being the answer.\nSo the final choice is A: Salmon", "answer": " 10"}

The 1st statement refers to a monetary contribution total, which is $50.\n  2. Then each student contributed $5 total, so there are 20 students and their contribution is $5 x 20 = $100.\n  3. Then the total cost of the trip is stated to be $7 x 20 = 140.\n\n2. Now we can calculate the total contribution of the students. It is $100 + $50 = 150.\n3. Then subtract the total cost of the field trip from the total contribution. The result is $150 - 140 = $10.\n4. Divide the result by 20 to get a per-student amount. The answer is $10/20 = $0.50.\n\n### Submit Question:\n###### Question Submitted By", "answer": " 10"}

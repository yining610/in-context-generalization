{"idx": 50, "text": "1) Let \"x\" denote the number of shells collected by Alan.\n2) The question says that \"Alan collected four times as many as Ben\". Mathematically, this means that (Alan's number of shells) = (Ben's number of shell / 4) ==> x=3 (Ben collected three). Now, this doesn't necessarily mean that Ben only got 3 shells. It could also mean that he got 4 or more and his number of shells is less than 3. Therefore, Ben's number of shell could be any of 1,2,3,4,>=5. So this means that Laurie must have collected >=36 shells.\n3) The next line of the question says, \"Ben got a late start and didn't collect a third of what Lauries did\", which implies that Lauries number of shell collection was equal to 4 times the number of shells that Ben collected (hypothetically let's call this number \"w\"). By substituting \"Laurie\" in the equation (Alan collected four times Ben as Ben collected (4w)), means that Alan collected 12 times (4w=12w).\n4) This means that (12 Ben)* 4 times (Alan collected Ben * 4 times) means that \"Alan \" must have collected a total of 12 Ben's shell collection times Ben's shell collection which is equal to (Alan's shells collected * 12 Ben' shells collected ) which would be equal to 50.\n5) Finally, Alan collected 50 shells and Ben collected 4.

{"idx": 51, "text": "1. The question asks about Gerald's ability to save for baseball supplies using lawn-related services that he provides.\n2. We can observe three important facts from the scenario.\n3. First, he spends $10/month on baseball supplies which is $40 in total if we consider over a 4-month span.\n4. Second, he spends an additional $10/month performing lawn-related activities.\n5. Third, he wants to use non-baseball months to save money for the baseball supplies, so his season is 4 months.\n6. These three factors help us calculate the total amount of savings he wants to generate.\n7. In order for Gerald to buy $40 worth of seasonal baseball supplies each month, we need to find how much money he is saving by performing additional lawn activities outside of his baseball season.\n8. Since he spends $110 per season (4 months * $28/month) we need to find $110- $100=$10, that is, how much he is saving.\n9. Hence, we can calculate to a certain degree, Gerald would be able to save a total of $10 (saving) per month during the off-season, in order to be able to afford $100 (buying supplies) per month. (4 months * $10 saving = $40 buying).\n10. However, we can not say with certainty, how many chores Gerald is performing at this ratio, as we don't have this information.\n11. Therefore, we cannot answer the question with the above details.\n12. We need to consider additional factors, such as the total number of months he is able to perform lawn/home-related tasks, as only then we can arrive at a definite answer.\n13. Therefore, option B: 0.75 is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are B:0.75\n\nInput:A certain box of fruits has six oranges. A certain brand of candies has six limes.

{"idx": 52, "text": "1) The question involves a statement of some process, and asks for how much fabric was left.\n2) The key to solving this question is to understand the relationship between length and width.\n3) We start with the fact that the lengths and widths of fabric cut for two room are different.\n4) We also know that the length and width of the bolt of fabric was 16 feet by12 feet.\n5) It's important to keep in mind that when we calculate the amount of fabric left, we subtract the length and width of curtains cut from the length and width of fabric used.\n6) Therefore, the difference between 12 and 6 is 6 feet, which means 36 square feet were used.\n7) The difference between 16 and 9 is 7, so we subtract 7 from 12, which leaves us with 5 square feet remaining.\n8) In addition, since the bolt's length was 16 feet, we subtract 4 from 16, which leaves us with a difference of 12. Subtracting 5 from 12 gives us 7 more square feet of fabric used.\n9) Hence, the entire piece of fabric is used up completely. As a result, we are left with no leftover square feet of fabric, and we must add 39 to 36 to get the final answer of 39.\nSo the final answe is 39.0\n\nInput:If I have a bag of pennies, is it cheaper to buy things in bags of pennies than a bag full of pennies?\nOutput:Based on the scenario, we have a bag of pence that can be used to buy items.\n1.

To answer this question, we simply compare buying items in the same bag (i.e. using the entire bag of pence) with buying one full bag of pence.\n3. If purchasing from the same bag, we must pay 1p per item, while if we purchase one full bag of pennies we pay just 1p, because the bag of pence in the question contains 200 p", "answer": " 160"}

{"idx": 67, "text": "1. In this case, the questions asks us to solve for the number of months after the down payment has been made in order to figure out the remaining monthly payment.\n2. 20% is the rate of down payment after which she pays $65 per month.\n3.  There is a payment gap of $446.99 per month after a 20% payment.\n4. So we need to multiply this by 4 since it is the number of months after she has made this additional payment. We obtain $1787.96, which is the remaining balance due after paying $20 for the additional down payment.\n5. Using this number, we can find out how much her balance would have been by dividing $65 by the value she pays each month, which is $1787 / 65 = 27.33. So, the remaining balance after paying for 65 months (4 in the question) is $1780.\nSo the final balance after the first month of installments will be $1780 and balance after 4 month payments will be $3560.6, which includes $350.1 from the initial down payment.\n\nInput:What type of exercise might increase blood flow to the lower limbs for runners?

The competition is split into a 4 rounds, Sam skipped 1 more times than Jeff, and Jeff skipped 3 less times than Sam in the first and second round. It is reasonable to conclude that Jeff skipped 4 less times than Sam in them.\n3) Jeff's numbers will depend on the rounds, so we must determine the difference between Sam's number of skip and Jeff's number of skipped.

Twenty-four divided by 48 is a result of 0.5.\n8. Multiplying this by two gives a result of 1\n9. The final result is 1\u00d72 (twice as much or two days) =2\n10. Therefore, the boat can accommodate two extra passengers during two days\nSo the final answer will be 1+2= 3\n\nTo summarize the answer\nDuring one day, a boat can transport up to 12 passengers.\n\nDuring one day's three boats totaling 48 people.\n\nTherefore the people can be 48 + 12 = 60\n\nTherefore the answer is 3.\n\nInput: Which of this group is in the same location?

{"idx": 128, "text": "1. A fence where there are 3 meowing cats means that they are near each other, so it is reasonable to assume they will hear one another and coordinate a schedule of meowing.\n2. Let's consider each cat individually, starting with cat 1.\n3. The first cat meows 3 times each minute.\n4. The first cat meowed is Cat_1_Meow1 and the next meow would then be Cat_1_Meows_2, and the next one after that would be Cat_1_meows_3.\n5. The second cat, being twice as frequent as that of the first cat, would make 6 meows in 5 minutes. So, the number of meows is Cat_1_meow1 + 6 Cat_1_meo2. The cat one also meows two times because 3/2 = 1.5, and 2(1.5) =2, thus making 7 meows overall.\n6. The third cat meows at one-third of the frequency of the second.\n7. The first cat meow 3 times, in 1 minute, while the 2nd cat meow 2 times(2 is 1.5 times more). Therefore, the 3rd cat will meow 0.33 times in 1 minute, which is, 0.066667 in 5 minutes(1/6.6667). The 3rd cat meow once in 5 minutes.\n8. Let's add up all 3 cats meows.\n9. This means that Cat_1_meowed_1 + (Cat_1_meowed + Cat_1_meods_2 + 6 times Cat_1_meoded + 0.067 Cat_1_mewed)\n10.

Choices:  Omelettes A: Eggs B: Meat C: Coffee D: Chocolate\nOutput: 1) So to answer this question, we need to analyze it on a case by case basis, as there are many things that could potentially make you feel more hungry than other things. But, generally, we could say that eating omelettes would never make you feel more hungriness than any other food on the list (because they have eggs which provide you with protein, which you cannot get from coffee or chocolates). You might lose your appetite if you have too much food. But if you're having coffee or chocolate, they'll actually make you more hungry... 6. One should not eat large portions of food at one go; and if they must, then they should space it out and take small bites.

So the question is trying to figure out how many loads of laundries it would require to clean all towels in the end. \n2. The vacuum rental property has a washing machine that can hold 14 towels.  Each day the people who use the towel will change their towel to avoid using the same towel again.  After 7 days, no towel will be left to be changed.  It is assumed that in the 14 washing machine, it can accommodate most towels in different sizes.  Even though smaller towels are also present in the vacation rental, they will not be washed. \n3. Since we are considering each family will have 1 oversized towel each day.  After 7 day, each family will use 14 oversigned towels.  Since there is a washing machine that accommodates 14 oversided towels.  We can deduce that the washing machine will do 14 loads (1 load = 14 towens) each day in 1 week.\n4. For the 7 days, it has 14 loads in one day.  Hence it has 98 loads (98*14 = 1412 towels) in one week.  But in the end, most towels (only the oversigned towls) will be washed.

The final table, after splitting the blue crayons into light to dark shades. \n\n2. From this table, we can infer some information.\nOut of 5 shades of blue, we can find that there is 1 shade that we received in extra, a total of (1+7+5+6+4)= 17. This basically indicates that Mary needs 17 to match 5 colors.\n3. Now to find out how many Mary now has left, it depends on how many she gave out.\n4. If she gave out 2 green crayons and a blue crayon, then she now has (17\u20132\u20131)=14 left.\n5. If she gives out just a green crayon, then Mary now has: (17\u20131)=16 left\n6. Now in the question, we have 3 green crayon and 1 blue cry.\n8. By simple mathematics, the solution is as follows:\n9. There are now 15 crayons left out of 17 which Mary should now have, but she's already given out 3 (green)\n10.

She needs to deliver twice as many packages as meal, which is 8, hence it implies that she can deliver 8 packages and 4 meals.\n3. She will have to deliver 27 packages and meals in total, we know that there is no requirement to deliver 4 meals as she could only deliver 2 meals if she was to distribute all his package delivery. So we have a total of 27 packages.\n4. Now we need to find how many packages Angela delivers of 27 in total.\n5. So if she is distingiuting all package deliveries, she needs to make 7 of 27 packages and 1 of 4 meals. But as packages are 2 times meal, so total packages are 14 and total meals are 5, therefore we have 14 packages and 5 meals.\n6. If she is to distribute 27 packages, she needs to make remaining 3 packages and 4 meal, but as she delivered 14 packages and no meal, so total number packages is 20 and total meals are also 5.\n7. Therefore she had to delive 14 packages and had to deliver 4 packages and 5 of meals.\n8. This would mean that out of 27 packages, 14 packages and out of 27 meals, 5 meals. Therefore she needed to delivery 14 packages and five meals.\n9. As she had to deliver 27 of each, she would need to deliver 14 packages and one meal of 27 meal she gets to distribute.\n10. So she would need to give 4 packages and 4 meats out of her total delivery.\n11. So one package is 8 times a meal, and hence 8 meals would be equivalent to 1 package.\n12.

It has a very interesting feature: words with the same meaning in one of the countries use different sounds to describe it.\nFor example: In Japan, they have two words to describe \"cat\" \u732b [1], \u306d\u3053 [2]. Both words were borrowed from Chinese and they both mean \"cat\". In this case, if you want to say the two words that mean cat, the pronunciation is \u306d\u3053 [2], \u306d\u3053 [1]. In other words, the native speaker says the same sound twice.\nThe reason why these words came from China is also related to pronunciation. In China, the phonetics is based on the traditional Romanization. The sound is represented by one letter. For example, \"cat\" can be represented by \"c\" in China as it is in English. So the Chinese pronunciation for \"cat\" is \u732b [3].\n\nWhat is remarkable is, in some places, they are saying the same sound twice with the same meaning. This is the case with \u30b3 [3], \u30b3 [4], which both mean \u30ab\u30c3\u30d1 [4].\n\nThe interesting part is that the new language does not distinguish homonyms, so we cannot know which means a particular word is referring to without finding out the actual connotation before the first sound is over. This will inevitably lead to confused pronunciation and misunderstandings as most of the native speakers are not familiar with this feature.

{"idx": 199, "text": "1. The question asks how many minutes Rosie should run on Friday in order to complete the week's target mileage.\n2. To find the answer, we can apply the \"if-then\" structure as follows:\n3. \"If Rosie runs for 'time x' minutes on day 'x', she will run 'distance x' miles for the week.\"\n4. For example, if she runs for 1 hour today, she runs 6 miles. So let's write it down:\n5. \"If Rosie run for 1 hour today (on Monday), she will run 6 miles for the week.\" This means we can substitute the numbers in the expression.\n6. Since she ran for 1 hour, substituting the values that she ran today for the entire week yields 6 x x = 6 x 1 = 60 miles!\n7. Now, let's check if that's correct:\n8. \"If Rosie ran for 30 minutes on day Tuesday, she will run 15 miles for the week\"\n9. We'll substitute the time of Rosie's running into the same expression:\n10. \"30/60 * 30/60 => 30/180 = 5/9 => 5/9 x 5/9 = 5/87 ~ 52.857 miles for the week\" \n11.

It wouldn't work because the sound wouldn't travel all the way to the other side of the house.\n4. option C: ring it twice suggests that one can ring the bell two times to verify if the doorbell button has been pressed once. This is not correct, as that would cause the bell to trigger twice before anyone gets inside the house.

This means that since Bobby has 16 toys cars currently, in three years he will have 32 toy cars.\n14. But Bobby's cars get bigger, it seems like we need to multiply this value by another number to bring it down, since 16 x 32 is around 8 times too much.\n15. If it means this, we can now substitute 16 for 8 which gives us 16 x 2.25 giving us 35.75.\n16. We now divide the final answer by 10 to convert it. Hence, the answer is 3.575.\n70. The answer is 3.2.\nSo the final answers are 3.578 and 3.2 respectively.", "answer": " 54"}
{"idx": 212, "text": "1. Last year she paid 1000$ for rent, 200$ for food, and 100$ for car insurance.\n2. This year the rent she pays goes up by 3, which essentially doubles her rent expenditure while the car insurance is triple, which leads to triple the amount of expenditure.\n3. For food, the expense went up by 4, which essentially quadruples the expenses.\n4. If the expenditure increases so much just this year, imagine how much it increases over two years where she had to spend the same amount, and then imagine how much it would cost her to triple over 5 years as it is not feasible for her to double every year.\n5. She'll have to pay for all this and this is just a one year difference and not even the entire span of the year as she might need to save to pay the same amount or higher from here on because she has to keep up with payments and this would essentially mean she would incur a total of 888.88$ more in expenses.\n6.

The question states that Randy has started playing the piano, so it's safe to assume that he has been playing it for some time to reach the level of playing it like a non-beginner.\n2. In order to become expert in his field, which is a pianist, Randy will need to play for 10,075 hours.\n3. 10,0652 = 12 which means that Randy can become an expert by the time he is turning 12.\n4. Since he is only 12 now, he can start practicing today. If each year he takes two weeks off for the vacation, it means that he has 51 weeks a year and 52 weeks with the vacation time. Since he is playing on Mondays to Fridays each week, he'll have 222 weeks to practice. Since he has turned 12, he has 121 weeks left before his 18th birthday, hence, he'll play for 121 * 7=847 days, and if we multiply 847 days by 24 hours in a day, we'll get 20,498 hours. Taking into account the days off per year, we get the total number of hours to practice that Randy will need to become an expert, namely 20,475 hours. Now 10,031 \u00f7 20,487 will give us the answer rounded up to the nearest hundred seconds/ minutes/ hours which is 14.74 hours.\n5.

Therefore, the faster reader has borrowed Jack's book.\n4. Based on the problem statement, it seems as if Jack's book can potentially be helpful for their school project.\n5.

Therefore, we can eliminate the options that are more general, such as\nD: considering and E: forgetting, leaving us with A: choosing, B making, C: using and G: trying.\n3) Since the context involves preparing a meal, it can be assumed that the person is unlikely to be taking and making decisions at the same time, so eliminating B: making.\n4) Likewise, it might not be reasonable for someone to be considering all options at the exact moment, so considering is also eliminated.\n\n5) Since the question is focused on the action of preparation and not the outcome, choosing is not the correct answer, as it will be unneeded to cook dinner.\n\n6) The outcome of using is that the person is using the ingredients, so it is also not what the person is doing (actions), but rather, what the person is obtaining or producing (products, outcomes). \n\n7) Likewise, \"trying\" would not make sense, because the word", "answer": " 7"}

Choices:  B: it is a noun C: it is an adjective D: it is a conjunction E: it is a verb\nOutput:1. The question asks us to identify a word that is not an adjective, this implies that the word is already present as an adjective in the sentence.\n2. Let's split the sentence into parts.\n3.  \"What\" refers to the word itself.\n4.  \"is\" is the preposition in the sentence.\n5.  \"more\" is not the adjective, it refers to the whole sentence, hence, it is not an adjective.\n6. \"even though\" is not the word either.\n7. \"the word\" refers back to the original adjective, that explains why it is not an adverb either.\n8.  \"word\" is a part of speech just like adjective, as they are both nouns, and does not indicate its presence as a noun, it is still an adjective, hence, not an adjective. \"is not a proper adjective\" is a statement, it is the same as adjective, and not indicating its presence as adjective as well, hence, it is not adjective as well.\n9.

{"idx": 235, "text": "1) Mark buys a loaf costing $4.20, along with a cheese for $2, so the total paid is (4.20+2) = $6.20\n2) So Mark pays $6.20 and the cashier gives him 1 quarter ($.25) and 1 dime ($.10) but also returns him the change in the form of nickels. In the problem, it is given that if the cashier returns some change to Mark, it will be in the form of bunch of nickels.\n3) If a quarter is ($.25) cents, then 1 dime is ($.10) and 4 quarters make 1 dollar, so we can say that 4 quarters = $4, 5 quarters = $5, 6 quarters = $6,... 10 quarters = $10 i.e. a quarter goes twice in a dollar because 10 quarters in a dollar and 10 quarters makes 2 dollars i.e. 5 quarters go in a dollar.\n4) So, if there are 1 quarter and 5 dimes(ten of them make $1.50) and one extra nickel to a total of 7 coins then (1/4) = 10/2 and since 10 quarters gives 2 dollars, we can say 10/2 will make 2 dimes in a dollar. Hence the total nickels in Mark's change is (250/2) = 125.\n5) So, the total amount of nickels that Mark receives is (125/5) = 25.\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'E: 25.\n\nInput: What is a better way to solve a math problem: use your calculator, estimate and then do the work yourself, or do it all yourself?

Based on that, in the second round, we can assume that Emma had at least 40 more eggs than Tanks.\n6.

Therefore, our options are C: $2 and E: $1\n5. Since Frank bought everything already, his peanuts are worth $3.

{"idx": 249, "text": "Let's start by analyzing what the question is asking.\n1. The \"normal\" subscription is 18 months and it normally costs $34. This subscription means that you purchase the subscription and pay at a time. The subscription lasts for 18 months, hence, it's not only for a single issue of the magazine.\n2. Now let's see what the promotional subscription refers to. It's a subscription of 36 issues, or 18 month. However, since it's a 18-month subscrition, the subscrition won't last 6 months for one \"subscrition period\", that's why, at first glance, it appears to be different.\n3. Therefore, \"two-monthly\" does not refer to one issue being delivered each two months, rather, it refers to the number of issues that you sign on for, and each time you pay, you are given an issue to read. So \"twice-a-month\" refers to 18 months, and \"two-monthly subscriptions\", refers to two to one months.\n4. Thus, the two-month subscription cost is $10 per 18 month subscription. It is 2 to 1, hence, there is an $0.25 discount per 18 month subscrition.\n5. In the end, you end up with a $1.5 discount per 36 month subscription (18 months multiplied with 2 months divided by 18 months equals 0.25 times 36).\n6.

She spent $13 on buying spoons which 13/6 comes to $\\frac{51}{18}$ so we can multiply it with $18$.

{"idx": 261, "text": "1 It's important to realize that, despite having an answer of ~38510 feet, the only answer choice is actually the fraction, 3/2. \n2 This question requires you to know a certain set of properties.  These are:\n - Shadows are always at least 1 foot long during the day,\n - Once shadows are longer than 1 foot, they grow by 1 foot per hour past noon, up to 5 feet,\n - That's what they call the \"12 noon\" hour.\n3 To answer the final question, we can take advantage of these properties.  We know that, after the 4th hour, we have that a shadow is 5 feet long at 13:00. \n4 Moreover, the number of hours in a day is 24, so the 6th hour is 19:00.  If we subtract 13:0 from 19:0, we see that we've got about 6 hours of growth. \n5 Moreover, it is now 6:00 past noon, and since growth is proportional to time, then in 6 hours, the shadow growth would be 6 hours, or (6/6) = 1 foot. \n6 Thus, at 19:08, the shadow is 5/14 or 11/7 of a foot.  This is 15/7 or a little over two feet.

First of all, the question is in the form of \"How many hours\", so we need to find the total hours John spends on all the gym sessions including the warm-up and cardio.\n3. We cannot easily find out the total number of hours John does his liftings, so we need to break it down to the three parts.\n4. The number of hours John spends lifting daily is 3 * 60 = 180, the warm-up and the cardio spend for a day is 30/3=10 (1/3 of 180 is 60, which is taken per day). Therefore the total number of lifting hours per day is 180+50 = 230\n5. In a week, John visits the gymnazium 3 times, so 330 is the total number of times he goes to the gym a week.\n6.

Further, 20 times 1/4 is 5 (not 25).\n6) We're left with option A - The first 1/4 of an object is a fraction that indicates a value of 1/4. This means that Nadia had to buy 5 roses and 3 Lillies per 1/4.\n7) The question asks for all the flowers she bought, that means she bought 20 roses + 12 lilies (3*4). Therefore the total cost must be 20*5 + 12*2 = 120 (cost in dollars)\nSo the final answer would be 120 (dollars).\nSo the final answer was B: 120 dollars!\n\n# 4: Pairwise\n\nInput: In a group of 20 friends, there are only 3 people who know each other.

{"idx": 274, "text": "1) The question asked how long this commercial will be \"after\" the desired changes, which implies that you want to know how much shorter this commercial will be.\n2) Let's start by considering the original commercial, which was 30 seconds long. This is equal to 30 x 1/60, which is also called 0.5 minutes.\n3) As our boss told Ursula to shorten the commercial, we can assume that after the new changes, the commercial should be shorter than 30 seconds. So \"After - Before\" = 0, where the question mark represents that it is unknown at this point.\n4) This means we just need to find the difference of the lengths \"After - Before\".\n5) To do this, we can subtract the Before-time from After-time, which is \"After-Time - Before-Time\".\n6) So, the formula for this is After-Time - Before-time = After - Before. In this specific case, we have it written in minutes as the question mentioned 30 seconds being 0,5 minutes, therefore the answer would be in the form of minutes.\n7) After - Before = 0,5 - 0 hence 0,5  minutes.\n8) Thus the shorter commercial will be 0.5 minutes shorter than the original.\nSo the final  answer is 0,5 minutes.\n\nInput: I recently purchased a shirt.

This could happen if the boy buys 6 cards out of the first box and 6 cards out of second box, or if the boy buys another box of cards from the same box or buys cards only from the first box, that could also be possible.\n4.

If the boys get 15 eggs and the girls get 9 eggs, that leaves 2 eggs for the family.\n8. A little arithmetic gives us 15+9=24.\n9. Divide that by 2 to find the boys count = 12\n10. The question asks how many boys went on the family trip\n11. The total number of eggs consumed by the whole family, including adults and both girls and boys is 39\n12. This implies that there were 3 adults and 12 boys on the trip.\n13. This makes perfect sense since this is an exposition on a family trip, where a mother, father and their kid should be present.\n14.

{"idx": 341, "text": "Since the rope is being manufactured it can be assumed that it has already been cut, so the rope that Tom wants to buy is already 1 piece (20 feet). \n1. If we assume Tom wants to buy the rope cut into 6 equal pieces, it isn't too far fetched (since 2 out of 3 people are right-handed) because he needs the rope to be cut into 6 equal (10 feet) pieces, which is not possible for any rope that has an odd number of feet (i.e. 3, 5, 7).\n2. If Tom wants to buy the whole rope, then that means the rope is 30 feet long (not 20), which implies the 1-piece rope that Tom wants is a sub-sub-section of the whole length of 30 feet, (i.e. < 7 feet) or < 20 feet. \n3. Tom needs to buy 6 equal lengths of rope (10 feet each) to achieve a total weight of 60 feet (that's the number of feet to move from 10 feet to 6 stories).\n4. To achieve 60 feet in rope, if we assume Tom cuts the whole rope into equal pieces, he'll need 10 pieces of rope (20 feet each = 50 feet, which is an odd length), which is too long.  \n5. The only way to achieve 60 feet is to cut 45% of the rope.\n6. If Tom cuts the whole 20 feet rope into 6 equal parts, he doesn't gain any additional length since all 6 equal parts add up to 10 feet.\n7. Let's assume that Tom buys the whole rope and cuts it into equal lengths but gets a 15% discount for lashing them together, this means that he only need 7.5 equal sections of rope (25 feet each), which results in a total weight of 125 feet for a total weight of 45 feet (20 feet + 7.5 equal lengths @ 25 feet each = 125 feet).\n8.

We can determine the number of tubs she bought by first determining the total sum she paid for all her tubs and secondly by calculating the number of tubs which are present if the amount she paid is shared equally.\n2.) So Alison paid $48 for her garage storage tubes. We can determine the cost of the three big tubs by multiplying $6 with the quantity of three, while determining the cost of the six small tubs by multiplying the $6 with the quantity six. The overall cost of the three big ones and the six small ones is $6x6 plus $6x3 = $48.\n3.) But all the tubs are supposed to share the same cost, which means: the cost of the six little tubs must be $6 + 6 = 12 since there are three big tubs. There can be 12/6 big ones or there can be six/6 ones for the 6 small tubs to share the $6 cost. There would be an even distribution of $6 cost between each person if it is assumed that there is one big tub and six smaller tubs.\n4.) The smallest one that is shared by all of Alison's tubs is $6, or there is a total of 7 tubs (6 + 1).

As the words \"top of the table\" could imply \"closest\" or \"farthest from the center of the table\", the answer doesn't have to be \"T\" as is commonly held, rather we can choose \"S\" because \"S\" is closer to the center of the table (if the point A is on the table and is at the top and it's the closest to the center by definition, A must be closer to the center than B who is directly next to A).\nSo the final answer for this question is S\n\nInput:Where do most airplanes park?

Bicycle \n(Still in use in some parts of Europe, rarely used in the United States anymore and also in Japan)\nb. Walking\nThis is a very common form of transportation. People would walk with their groceries from the store to their houses. It would be a bit uncommon to transport large objects this way if they are heavy.\nc. Car\nThis is the most common mode of transportation all over the world today. You would use a car to travel from your car to a shop to purchase goods, it would be rather unlikely to transport the goods you just bought back home on your car. Cars are a faster means of transportation over cars or bikes, and so it is quite likely that this is the means by which people transport their goods from shops to their homes.\n2. Choice A, Car, can be eliminated since it is a more faster means of transport, people are quite unlikely to transport their goods home from shops on a car.\n3.

If every person has to give $6, instead of $10 each, there would be 8 people giving $6, which sums up to $36 instead of $100. So $8 more per person would mean an increase of $100 over the original $100.\n4.

This means that each boat can only have 2.5 feet of space between them.\n4) We can now use Pythagoras' Theorem, which states that the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides, to calculate the number of boats that the river can contain.\n5) In essence, we want to find X\u00b2 such that X\u00b2 + X\u00b2 = 42\u00b2\n6) If we square root the equation above, we find that:\nX\u00b2 + X\u00b2 = Y\u00b2\n7) Solving both sides of the equation for X yields that\n2X\u00b2 = 82\n8) Setting X = 8 / 2 in the above equation yields a value of 4.\n9) Therefore, since each boat has 2.5 feet between them, and there are 2 feet between each side of the river, we can determine that there are a maximum of 9 boats that can fit in a river that is not wider than 42 feet across.\n10) Therefore, the correct answer to the question is Choice C: 9.\n\nInput: I need to purchase a suit.

The crane is 28 feet taller than the building. The second crane is 120/100=.60 so the building is 228+((.6*100)+60)=216 feet tall.\n5.The second crane is 47 feet taller than the second building. The third crane is 147/140=1.063 so the building is 457+((1.063*100)+20). Therefore, this crane is 3 feet taller than its corresponding building.\n6.Hence, the percentage of the difference between a crane and its corresponding building is (28/228)*.100=.1239314, on an approximate level.\nSo, the percentage increase is: 147/457=approximately 31.5%.\n7.

{"idx": 450, "text": "The number of legs in a group of spiders is simply the sum of the total number of legs. Let's consider two simple scenarios of 3 and 5 spiders to understand this question clearly.\n1. Firstly, if you have 3 spiders, a group of three spiders would have a total of 24 legs, comprising 8 legs for the first spider, 12 legs for the second spider and 12 legs for a tertiary spider.\n2. Secondly, if you had 4 spiders, the total legs in a group of four spiders would be 28, with 7 legs for the first spiders, 9 legs for the second and 12 legs each for the third & forth spiders.\n3. Using a similar logic, we can figure out how many combined legs 10 spiders have. Now, since we already know how many legs a single spider has (8), we only need to worry about the difference between the two numbers. As 5 is less than 8, the total number of legs for a group of 10 spiders would be 40 (10\u00d78<5).\n4. Hence, the total number of spiders with a total of 48 legs.\n5. However, 48 legs aren't enough to account for half of the 56 legs of a single spider, so we must have another spider somewhere else.\n6. So, the total legs for a group of spiders will have to be 54. Since there are 14 legs for a single spider, we know that there must be 11 spiders in a group to account for the extra 4 legs.\n7. Hence, a group of 11 spiders will have a total of 65 legs (54 legs + 11 spiders).\n8. To find the number of legs in a total group of spiders, we can simply add the two answers we've calculated so far.\n9.

The statement tells that John's bonus is the same percentage every year; it does not says that the percentage is the same each time.\n3.) There is no information about the size of that bonus in the statement, this information is missing.\n4.) The problem is ambiguous because it doesn't state how the total is computed from the $200, 000 earned and $10,0 000 bonus.\n5.) We can eliminate the options BDCE from the answers based on the fact that no percentage is the same yearly.\n6.) Based on the analysis till now, we can eliminate options A, B, C and E. Then option F is automatically the most likely option.\n7.) Option F is the most likely because no percentage bonus is the same yearly, the bonus is the same percentage each year and it's the same amount each year.\n8.) Option F is the correct answer because the bonus this year is the same percentage of previous year but it's twice bigger which is not the same percentage.\nSo the final choice is F.\n\nInput: What are things that humans are good at that animals are not?

No animal can run as fast as humans because of two main reasons; 1) Humans have a unique bone structure that supports our muscle to contract faster than any other animals. 2) Humans don't have to think about running as much because their brain is optimized for walking for over millions of years. 3.Animals don't have toes and fingers because they need their hands and feet to do other things other than 'running'. 4.

Choices:  a: On the chess board. b: under the king. c: next to the queen. d: in a drawer. e: under the table. f: at the store.\nOutput: This question is looking at the fraction 3/5, and asking what's the location where it \"stays\" (permanent storage) with respect to some other chess pieces. So, the first thing to do is to calculate where this 3/5 fraction \"lives\" with respect to other chess pieces. Because of the \"keeped\" description, we can assume that this is not the same as what's the location of a fraction \"at\", so it is not one of these options a, c, or e. At a glance, option f doesn't seem to follow from the question.\n1. Next, let's consider each choice and analyze them with respect to the fraction 3/10, which is equal to 3/5.\n2. Option A: On the chessboard.\n3. The chessboard is where the entire chess pieces are kept, this is not a place where 3/10 fraction could stay. It has to be somewhere else. So, option A, On the chess board, is definitely not the answer\n4. Option B: Under the king\n5. The king is the most important piece in chess. When a player loses or makes a bad move, when their king is attacked, the game is over. The king symbolizes power and nobility. If the chess pieces were kept under the king, then a lot of them would be lost and the game would be \"over\" before it started. In the same way, it is not feasible to keep 3", "answer": " 20"}

{"idx": 467, "text": "1. The question asks about Mark's total number of remaining days after using half of his 10 sick and 10 vacay days.\n2. Each day represents 8 hours worth of work, therefore, I can assume that Mark's total workday will be 40 hours (10*8 =40).\n3. We can simplify the condition that Mark used half of his 19 days to:\n\nMark used sick days: 9 \n\nHe still has 11 sick days\n\nMark used vacation days: 9 18 18 10 1 8\n\nHe still has remaining 8 days in vacation.\n\n4. So, the total number of days available for Mark is 19 (10*8) days.\n5.

An object could look shiny because it's glitters or it's surface is polished or something. But shininess isn't necessarily indicative of that object's quality as reflector.\n4. Option A, \"definately\", is an answer that suggests that shine always means reflect. So, it cannot be chosen.\n5. Similarly, option B, perhaps, also contains the same element suggesting that shininess always equates reflection, thus it also cannot be selected.\n6.

If he buys T-shits, sweaters + jackets with 10% and 5% discount respectively, the total price should be\n5. $192 + $180 + 30 (10% off), which is not correct (we know jacket costs $80, the total of all other items should be less or equal to $192, and the discount price of sweater is $168+0+0$, so the final price for 6 shirts with 5% discount and 10% disc should be 192+18 + $135 - we know $135=0, so it was incorrect).\n6. The total should be 198 ($8*6+8*4=168 +10% disc on 196) + 135 = 333.5 + 5% sales = 347.75\n7. So the exact correct final amount is $347.77\n8.

Since there are 2 different types of rocks being added to two different layers, there can only be 8 layers that do so, since there are 8 unique rocks being added to 8 different layers. There are 4 types of rocks being added, so the number of layers that contain 4 distinct rocks must have 4 layers (of course since there are 20 layers, each with 1 of only 8 \"non-unique\" rocks added, that means not all 40 of those layers are included in this number). The last 9 layers can contain 5 different rocks being added, which is why there are 9 layers of this type. By adding up the number of layers we subtracted and have left, we come up with finding that there are 29 layers (2 of the 10 being 1 rock each, 8 adding 2 rocks each, 4 adding 4 rocks each, and 9 adding 5 rocks each)\n4) By rearranging the above formula to remove the absolute values (1 and 20) from within the parenthesis, we can solve to determine the total number of rocks in a canyon's strata", "answer": " 3"}

There is one set of variables for feeding the mom and another set of variables for feedings the puppies.\n3) Assuming that the mom and the puppies eat at the same time, we know the following:\n4) *The mom needs 1.5 pounds of kibble 6 times a week, at 3 feeds per day.\n5) *The puppies need 1/2 pound of kibble per day\n6) *There are five small puppies.\n7) One pound of dog kibble contains at least 22 cups of food, depending on the food product.\n8) One hundred grams of rice kernels yields 380 calories, which is equivalent to 3 cups of food.\n8) The mom needs 2.5 times the amount of rice kernels that a single puppy would need to feed it. \n9) In order to accommodate the fact that the puppies eat TWICE a day (in comparison to the mom who eats three times a day), 5 extra pounds total must be purchased.\n10) With this information in mind, Joy could calculate as follows:\n11) Puppies' kibble requirement (1/2 pound per day) x number of puppies = 1.25 pounds daily.\n12) Puppies' daily kibble required = 4 pounds per month (6 days per month) x 5 puppies = 4 pounds total.\n13) Mother's kibble requirement (0.15 pounds per feeding, three times daily) = 0.15 pounds daily x 5 feeds a day x 6 days = 0.26 pounds daily\n14) Mother's daily kibble required per month = (26 pounds per month) x 4 = approximately 100 pounds per month", "answer": " 57"}

Option B: 24, is also not correct as the required number of rides is the same number of seated people.\n8. Option D: 108 can also be eliminated as 1 seat is occupied by the ride operator, and there are no extra seats to accommodate.\n9. Option C: 84 is the correct answer as it is the number of rides that would be required to accommodate all 12 seats.\n10.

Wall in a house is a part of home, if a plumber comes with water pipes, he would only be able to get them from the home, so option C is incorrect. \n\nEither in a house or in an apartment, it is likely that both you and your family or a landlord knows the pipes that exist in the building, most likely they will know where the plumping is located, in my case it would be the kitchen. In a kitchen there are pipes with water faucets on them, if you go with option A there is no plumbing in factories, it will definitely be incorrect. The pipe in the factories is the one that goes straight to the sewer, with no water in it, this piping would be pointless.  \n\nThe final answer is A : oil refineries. \nTo be able to get water you would have to know where the plumber is, he wouldn't have a high enough pressure so option D E and A are all definitely incorrect. \n\n### The third instruction (grade math)  \nThe final answer here is D: accomplishing because they havent done it yet so C is incorrect. B is correct because they are starting to work and that is something they do. E is incorrect because Momentum is not doing anything it is a force, not something one is doing.\n\n### Explanation (grade math)\nThe answer is that you would find pens with a", "answer": " 27"}

{"idx": 612, "text": "1. The question asks us to determine how many slices of pepperonis are on the slice that Lard gives to Jelly.\n2.  We know Lard first takes a whole pizza, uncut, and divides those slices into halves.  So initially there are two halves of a pizza.\n3.  He then cut those halves into halves. Assuming there were 40 slices originally, so this reduces the two remaining halves into four halves each.\n4.  Lard finally cuts each four halves into halves, which reduces them to eight pieces of pepperoni, then picks one to give Jelly.\n5.  Since the initial number of pieces is 40, then each of the eight pieces has one-fifth share of the whole pizza, and there were eight pieces originally.\n6.   Therefore, one-eighth of the whole pizza will fall, which is half of one, which is 0.5 slices.\n7.  If 1 of them falls when Lard gives it to Jelly, then only a fourth of Jelly's slice must be the part that was missing.\n8.  Which means that 0.5 \u00d7 14 = 0.7 slices had been missing from the initial of Jelly's original slice.\n9.  And this means that a total of 1.9 slices are still on the slice Jelly gets from Lard.\n10.

In all of the above temperatures, the meat must be cooked to the core, which is medium.\n3. Since we are cooking the roast, any of the above temperatures when read in context is correct.\n4. Medium is what I prefer as a cook, because rare can be a bit more tough but can also be a bit dry. Well done seems to be a bit more cooked then medium, a bit more done then medium.\n5. Medium is what is used the most, and you should use it as the base line when cooking.\n6.

Dog walkers are typically freelance professionals that work at their own pace and take one client at a time, so the question becomes more focused on the number of dogs they walk per day instead of what their weekly schedule is.\n2. Harry earns $5 for each dog he walks, so we can use the multiplication method to calculate the revenue.\n3. At 7 dogs per day, Harry's daily revenue is 5 x 7 = $35.\n4. At 12 dogs per day, Harry earns 5 x 12 = $60 daily.\n5. At 9 dogs per day, Harry has a revenue of 5 x 9 = $45 per day.\n6. Harry walks dogs for 5 days a week, so weekly revenue (Monday - Friday, excluding Thursday) is 35 + 60 + 45 = $140.\n7. Harry walks dogs on Thursday, which has fewer dogs than the other days (9), so he nets $5 less for what he does on Thursday.\n8. Harry goes on 6 walks, his daily average, for each of the other regular 5 days - 30.\n9. Thursday, on the other hand, has 9 dogs, so he goes on 6 (6th day regular) + 3 (9 dogs) = 9 walks on Thursday, his highest number of walks in a day.\n10.

Taking Square root of both sides, we have,\n\n\tSquare root of Total trash can - total trash can -2\n\n \tSquare root = (19x62) + 14 = 1897\n\ttherefore,\n\n\t19 = Square root of (Total trash can - total Trash can -2)\n10. So the total trash can = Square root of (2*street + total trash in back side of store)\n\n11. 2 * Street = 14\n12. Total Trash Can = Square Root of 19 - 14 -2\n\nFinal Answer: 19\n\nInput:What is the sum of two numbers in the equation that is 12 more than 4 times that difference?\nOutput: 25\n\n1.

That means there are 5 spots left empty for either men or women.  \nTherefore, we know that we will have one remaining man of every 5 picks, or 0.8/5 or 0.16/5 of men remaining that have not been chosen to dance.  \nAs we've chosen 5, there will be 0.16 remaining for every man that has not chosen a woman. (We start with 8/5, then we subtract 5, which equals 2.  Then we take.16 over 2 and add the result to.16. This gives us 0.16 that will remain for every man that does not choose to be a dancer).  \nFor every woman chosen, we subtract 7. If we have women selected before men, we subtract 7 men first.

On each floor, there are half of the floors with six apartments each and each apartment can accommodate up to four residents.\n3. We want to figure out the maximum number of residents.\n4. We can create an equation to model how to solve this question.\n5. The number of apartments = 12/2 = 6\n6. The number of residents in each apartment = four\n7. The maximum number of residents in the entire block of flats = X\n8. The number of apartements where X = six = 6\n9. The minimum number of apartment where X = four = 4\n10. The total number of apartments = X - 4 = 6 - 4 = 2\n11. The formula of Equation X = Six/2 = 6/2 is represented as the equation 12/2 where X is equal to six on both sides of the equation and is multiplied by two on both sides of the Equation as well.\n12. We can determine the answer for X. We know X - 4 =2, then we will subtract 4 from X to get 2.\n13. So, X = 6+2 = 8. There are 8 apartments.\n14. We can also consider each of the apartments X - 4 = and multiply each apartment with X/2.\n15. X/2 = 4 then X/2=6.\n16. X/2(6) = 6\n17. X = 3.

We are given the information that there are 4 seasons in a calendar year: Spring (1st quarter), Summer (2nd quarter), Autumn (3rd quarter) and Winter (4th quarter). \n2. A quarter of a year is 3 quarters, with a quarter making part of 3 quarters (1/3), and hence, we have (1/3) (4 quarters), which means (1/3) 12 (quarters), which reduces to 4. So there are essentially 4 quarters in 1 year, and hence, 1 quarter is 3 months, which is either a 3-month spring, summer, autumn, or winter. \n3. By applying base knowledge, we know each season lasts 4 months, and hence, a quarter is either an Autumn or a Winter.\n4. The answer provided is Autumn/ Winter, which means it last 4 months. Let P represent the period for Winter, or Autumn, and let A be the answer of the question. \n5. We have P = 4 months, and A = 1/3 * (4months). Using the distributive property, we get A = 12/3 * 4 = 4/3 * 4, or 1 & 1/3 * 4.\n6. When we multiply with 4, the outcome is 4/3 * (1 & 1/2) * 4 = 16/3 *4, or 12/3 of 4 = 4. We", "answer": " 117"}

From the last bullet, we know that Tanika sold a total of 60 boxes on one day and 75 boxes on the next, as suggested by the answer choices.\n4. The best way to evaluate this question is to plug in a number. If 40 was a possible choice, Tanika sold only 40 boxes, so we can eliminate choices 2-4.\n5. Tanika sold 120 boxes of crackers in total on the two days she had the fundraiser.\n6. As the two days are distinctive on their own, we have to add the total number of boxes she sold over two days and multiply it by 2 to get the actual number of boxes she sold.\n7.

Below are the possibilities to consider:\n1. He charged it without paying, meaning he did so for free but used up that battery capacity.\n2. Let's say he charged it for $1, that means he used $1 of the $4 battery capacity that he had.\n3. Let us also say he charged it for a sum that is greater than the initial $1 capacity. Now $1 remains of the original battery capacity and the balance is used to complete the next charge.\n4. Similarly for $2. Initial $1 remains and the balance is used up for the third charge.\n5. For a charge of $3, initial $2 remains and the balance is still there at $1 to be used for the fourth and final charge.\n6. $3 remains and he now has $1 to spend for his trip. That means this scenario would mean he paid $20 at all 4 charges, spent $3 in each but still has $1 to arrive at his destination.\n7. This scenario covers both the possibilities for his last 2 remaining charges. He has $1 for each, and yet he had spent $4 on all 4 charges. The charge of $3 that he did while on his way must be the free one done without payment.\n8. Therefore, in the 4th payment, the $3 charge, which must have been done for free, was done in some unspent $1, which means his final balance is the initial $1.\n9.

So we know the first level would have only 100 sparos.\n3) Based on the question description, there are 58 sparos which are opened on the 1st level but this doesn't mean that it will be full, hence, it is not the total number of sparos in each level and all of these we can find in the problem statement.\n4) Based on the question statement, there's an increase and drop or increment of the number of sparos with every level. This means that the 1st level has the least amount of sparos. For example, the second level would have an amount of 2 more sparos than the 1st level and the third level would have 5 more sparos than second level. This means that it will increase and drop until reaching the highest level of four levels.\n5) Hence, the answer according to the parking garage would be, 58 + 2 + 5 + 31 = 101.\n6) So, option A is correct.\nSo the final ans is A:101\n\nInput: When do you add the most in arithmetic?

First, let's see how the children are divided between the morning and afternoon camp sessions.\n\n```\nTotal kids: 1500 // 750 kiddos go to morning camp, and the rest are in afternoon\n\nKids going to morning camp: 1250 // 50% of 1500\n\nKids going at afternoon camp: 750 // 1/4 of 150\n\nTotal kids in morning and afternoon camp: 1995\n```\n\nThe reason we need to know # of kiddos in camp overall is to know how many going in the morning and how many going in the afternoon. We start with the total number of kiddos in the morning:\n\n```\n1500 - 750 = 750\n```\n\nWe do the same for afternoon camp.\n\n```\n 750 - 50 = 700\n```\n\nTotal number of kids in morning and in evening camp are given by:\n\n```\n750 + 700 = 1450\n```\nBecause these numbers are so large, we don't need to do any more complex computations to conclude the answer is 1450.

We can divide it by half, to get the total number of dollars we have after the transaction.\n3. We don't know how much she started with, but we know that it was 2 halfs of the overall amount after spending half that money.\n4. This can be simplified into :  (first half + second half) / 2 > than the amount remaining\n5. (first half + secondhalf) can be simplified into 3 halfs. So we have 3 halfs of the total money. But again, we have no idea how many actual dollars are in each half, so we need a conversion factor to figure this out.\n6. Lets say there's 1 dollar in every cent. So, 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents.\n7. 3 halfs implies that we have 3 of each denomination of the currency.\n8. So 3 halves of 1 dollar, and 3 halves of each denomination after that, gives the total number of dollars in every half.\n9. Now plug these values into our previous equation:  (first half + 3 halfs of one dollar + 3 halves of one cent) / 2 > 3 halfs left over.\n10. (1.5 + 4.5 + 6) / 2 > remainder of 3\n11.

The object's interior angles are not greater than its exterior angles, meaning they follow the rule of a shape with convex sides. The interior angles are actually smaller than the exterior angles.\nAs a result, convex objects have smaller curves and a lower angle for each side, as compared to the base.\n\nA good example of a convex shape is the letter Y.\n\nA concave object contains interior angles that are greater than its exterior angles resulting in lower angles for each side, as in comparison to the base. \nExamples can be an open-ended cylinder or a concave parabola.\n\nIn such an object, if each face of it is concave in shape, we refer to that shape as concave.\n\nOne way to check if an object is concave or convex is to draw it. For the convex shape, we get a figure with lesser angles and vice versa for the concave shape.\n\nFor a convex shape, the base has a shape that is similar, or identical in case of an open-ended cylindrical shape, to the shape of the object and vice versa.\n\n\nFor an object to be convex, the sum of the outer angles, exterior angles, must be less than the sum of the inner angles, the interior angles.", "answer": " 21"}

We assume all the questions as correct and then find out how to change them to wrong. The correct answers are as follows:\na).The question asks for a 4 digit number, so we can only consider numbers having 4 digits.\nAlso, as we cannot leave any numbers out, which means the question can contain no repeating digits and the sum of digits must be not equal to 18 also.\n2. Also, if the sum of numbers can never exceed 10, then no numbers can exceed 9.\n3. Therefore, the solution to this question gives following answer.\na). The question contains all four digits, so it's the correct answer.\nb). The question does not contain a digit repeated 2 times. Since the question is limited to 4 digit numbers, which means it can only contain 4 different digits, we can eliminate choice B.\nc). The sum of all the digits is not equal to 10", "answer": " 220"}

Sucking blood from different individuals to take 2 pints out of them each day is a simple task.\nSo, we are trying to find out how many people he needs to suck to get 7 gallons.\n2) The number of people who are capable of sucking 2 pints each day is determined by dividing the 2 pints among all the people and is represented by the following mathematical formula:\n\t4. Let's begin by determining the number of days in a month.\n4.1: Since there are 28 days in a month, the vampire needs 28 days to obtain 7 gallon, and in this solution we're assuming that he doesn't suck everyday but only 28 times per a month to get 7 gallon, so the number of days per month to obtain 7 gallions=28\n4.2: Now, we want the number of people in a day that can help him get 7 gallons, so we need to divide the number of days by how many people we need to suck per day (2 pints). So, how many people we need in a day=28/2=14\n4.3: Now, the vampire only needs 14 people in a day to suck 2 pints each, meaning how many people should we suck for 7 gallion of drink that day=14/2=7\n4.4: This means that the number of people who have 2 pints sucked from them is 7.\nSo, to answer the question in conclusion:\n\t5. The vampire needs 7 days in a month to obtain 7 pints (=2 gallion)  and 7/28=1/4 days to obtain a pint from a person\nFinal Answer:\n7 people in a day to get 7 pints.  7 people in a month to get 2 gallin", "answer": " 4"}

{"idx": 749, "text": "1. The question asks how much of her savings has been left after buying a pair of earrts that cost $23 dollars and a necklace that costed $28 dollars.\n2. The cost information tells us that Scarlet spent a total of $91 dollars for her jewelry, which means the cost of each item was roughly equal. Let's assume $0.27 as the relative price fraction for the two jewelry items.\n3. In real-world calculations, we might add the two costs to obtain the total amount to calculate the fraction. However, this will increase the precision error, since each term added will carry some unavoidable rounding error. \n4. So here, I would prefer to calculate the total cost first, then subtract it with Scarlet's savings to obtain the remainder.\n5. Hence, 2.7 is the relative price fraction in my method.\n6. 2.7 * 91 = 250.7 is the total cost of earrings and necklace for Scarlet. Subtracting the result from her total savings of 80, the remainder is 260.3.\n7. Therefore the answer is option D: 260.\n8.\n\nInput:What does it mean if a computer program freezes?

Option 1 does not match the definition. \"You can no longer use it\" implies that it isn't frozen anymore, but the definition states that it is frozen.\n2. Option 2 is also not a match, since \"stopping for a second\" does not necessarily indicate that the program is no longer responding.\n3. Option 3 is also incorrect, as a program freezing doesn't imply it needs to be repaire\n4.

The remaining kids need to be summed up to find out if they went for the raft trip.\n5: Therefore, we can say that 20 kids out of 40 remained at the lake, as none of them joined the rafting team.\n6: Adding 20 to the initial figure of 40, we get 60 which is the total number of kids.\n7: From the provided information, it is now very clear that the sum of all the kids present at Lake Pleasant was 60, and we can hence determine that 30 kids went for the raft excursion, out of which only half of them were part of the tubers (15 kids).\n8: That means a total of 15 out of 40 klds joined the rafting expedition.\n9: The final answer is A) 15.\nSo the final answers is A: 15", "answer": " 5"}

However, if Jimmy starts with 1 slice of bread each - that is, he buys 8 packs (40 slices divided by slices in a pack) - but he then uses two sandwiches for each pack (divided by 4 slices), the answer is 14.\n3.) Thus, if we subtract 1 from 14, we get 13.\n4.) The question asks how many sandwiches, which implies that a sandwich is made of only two slices of bread.\n5.) If a sandwich were to be made out of four slices of bread, then Jimmy would need to buy 6 packs (24 slices divided by 2 slices in a pack, divided by 2, yielding 6 packs).\n6.) Since he starts with 1 slice in each pack (40 divided by 4), he ends up with 2 packs left (20 divided by 2).\n7.)

So x = 2461 minutes. They must have traveled for 2461 plus 3 = 2464 total minutes.\n    - \"If they traveled for 3 hours, Amoli drove 41 miles for 3 hours\" means Amoli drove 48 miles total.\n3. The remaining distance 369 - 48 = 321 to be traveled is: 61 Miles (Anayet took all this time to travel 61 miles) + 42 Miles (3 hours Anayet took to travel 61 Miles, so, Amoli took 42 hours to travel 42 Miles) = x + x = 103 Miles, Amoli must have completed 103 miles.\n    - They can further be grouped as 90 miles traveled 58 miles + 42 miles traveled 48 miles.

The second job involving fixing two toilets requires a total of eight toilets to be fixed, and the third job involving fixing one toilet requires a total of six toilets to be repaired.\n4,All three options have unique combinations of sinks and showers.

Carla has 11 free seats, which means that among the other seats of the row, either all are free or not.\n12. Therefore, we'll analyze the cases of empty seats separately.\n13. If all seats are free, then each seat is at least 1/6 empty.\n14. If not, then at least 1/2 seats are always free.\n15. \"1 less than three times that (6) is five fewer 5 - 5 < 1\" means that Carla has at least five more students than she is able to account for when counting.\n16. One could say that this is a contradiction, which is solved by subtraction.\n17. \"Those subtractions (4 and 5) yield 1\" or Carla's class has 1 fewer student than the number of empty seats.\n18.

He also has a stock which is 200 fish in number along with 150 fish which are fresh and 50 fish which are spoiled.\n2) 50 fish gets sold and it is noticed in the stock that half of it gets ruined because the refrigerators break down. Now the stock is still the same, with only 200 fish, however, it has 150 fewer fresh fish than it had before, and 60 fewer spoiled fish than it had earlier. Hence the new stock has not been affected and the stock still consists of only 200.\n3) Now, along with the fresh fish, 200 more get brought which means that he has more stock than he had earlier. It is safe to assume that 60 are fresh and 140 are spoiled since the refrigerator is not working and hence there are 140 extra fish. If Steve sells all the fish, then obviously the stock will be 0.\n4) Consider 2 scenarios of how the stock may shrink. \n- Selling one fresh fish and one spoiled fish. But, it is known that Steve sells in batches rather than in single units. Hence, it cannot be considered.\n- He sells one non-fresh fish. This may lead to the fish getting spoiled, which is what is supposed to happen according to the question. However, the amount of non-fresh fish which is brought is equal to the spoiled one.\n- There are a total of 61 refrigerators around the shop.

{"idx": 856, "text": "1. \"Noemi lost $450 on roulette and blackjack\" can be read as \"Noemi lost $500 - $400 = $10 on roulette\".\n2. Similarly, the second sentence \"Noemi lost $10\" can be read as \"$10 - $10 = $0 on blackjack\", which means she actually won ($10 on blackjack).\n3. Now we must ask ourselves what does \"still had $800\" mean. The key is to understand what happens after winning or losing money during the game.\n4. A player starts with an initial amount and bets that amount every time they play, which may either win (and thus increase the initial amount), lose (and thus reduce the initial amount), or tie (where the initial amount is neither decreased nor increased).\n5. Hence, in order to preserve the balance after each game, the player needs to adjust the total \"pure\" gains and losses to a sum of zero, which can be achieved by adjusting the initial amount.\n6. The player may also have an additional sum of money in their purse, but it will not be considered part of the game because it's not used up during any of the game processes (nor is it affected by any gains or losses made during the game process).\n7. Let's take a scenario: Noemi begins with $800, and loses on roulette and black jack.\n8. The first step involves considering the losses made as gains for the initial amount and vice versa (because one doesn't want to be left with zero as it's impossible to win).\n9. In other words, if total losses on roulette and black jacx are $500 (= $400 + $999), the initial amount that can be adjusted in the next step will be $120; and if total losses on black jack + $400 (which equals $400 + (-$999) + $400), the adjusted initial amount will be $199 (= $140 + $59).\n10. After that, we apply the formula: \"Initial amount - (Total losses + Total gains) = Initial amount starting with (pure) no change\". Let's apply:\n                                                3.

But if one is required to choose one of five options, the best choice could be 8 or 7. The option should be chosen such that it meets two goals: A. To provide clear and unambiguous feedback about a survey participant's knowledge or opinion about the content of the survey. B. To provide useful information about the survey's quality, and should not contain negative comments or feedback. 6 and 8 fulfill those requirements. For example, if a survey participant doesn't know about something, saying they have no idea is not that helpful because it implies that they don't know nothing about the survey. But saying that I don't care doesn't provide any information. Option 7 is appropriate because it could indicate that the survey participant may not agree with that survey option, or the survey option may raise a personal concern about the survey.\nSo the final answers 6 and 7 are the best suitable answer for this", "answer": " 200"}

Let us take the hard drink into account and add it to the candy in our calculations.\n4. The cocoa drink contains 2500 added sugar calories. 5% of it adds 125 calories.\n5. We know that our total intake should be 150 calorie above the 150 caloric added sugar, this leaves us with 375 excessive calorie.\n6. The candy contains 25 calorie sugar per single bar, this means that I have consumed 25 more than necessary calories on average per candy bar.\n7.

{"idx": 861, "text": "1. The question provides several inputs and asks how much will Greg and Elmer have together in dollars after the debts are paid, so we can assume that Greg or Earl, or possibly both has a debt of $40, but we don't know who owes whom.\n2. Let's start by defining some symbols that will assist the calculation process.\n3. We define the variables Earl, Greg, Fred and $90, $48, $36 and $40 respectively.\n4. To simplify the calculations, we can further define a few variables.\n5. $x = x+y, where x is an earned amount and y is an owed amount.\n6. We can further define another variable, $r for refund, and $p for paid.\n7. In this instance, the variable $x represents the total amount that Earl and Greg earn collectively. (x=90+40)\n8. $y represents the total amount that Fred and Greg earn together. (y=(48+36))\n9. $r = x - y \n10. r = x - y (refund)\n\n11. $p = x + y (paid)\n12. p = x + y\n\n13.  We can calculate Earl's credit balance, from $r(x-y). Earl is owed $28, so his credit balance is thus defined as (28-(90-48-40) = $10\n14. Now, we can use Elmer's credit balance value to eliminate it from the total payable amount equation, which is given as (x+y) - (p+ 40).\n15. So, Earl's credit balance should be substituted into this equation to get; =(x+y)-$(r+40)$\n16. From here, we can use Earl's credit sum ($10) to substitute further.\n17. Since $10 refers to the (x-y) credit balance, we need to substitute for it first, by using the formula (x - y). Earl owes Fred $48. So his outstanding balance owed is subtracted from his credit balance.\n18. So, the equation becomes (90+40)-(y-48", "answer": " 130"}

{"idx": 879, "text": "1) Let's count how many fruits Santino has. Firstly, we need to figure out the total number of fruits Santino has based on the information given. For each papaya tree, we have 10 fruits and for each mango tree, we have 20 fruits. Hence, Santino will have 10 + 20 = 30 fruits.\n2) Now, we need to find the total number of frits Santino has as we want to solve this based on our original information given. We know that Santino's total fruits is 30.\n3) Santino has 2 papayas and 3 mangos. Therefore, Santino has exactly 5 fruits. Since each papaya produces 10 fruits, Santino gains an additional 10 papaya fruits from each of his papaya trees. Therefore, Santino's total papaya fruits become 10 + 10 = 20 papayas.\n4) Santino's total mangos are actually 2 mangos + 20 mangos * 3 = 20 + 60 = 80 mangos. Therefore, he has 80 mangos in total.\n5) Total number of fruits = 20 + (10+10) + 60 + 80 = 20 +120 + 62 = 212 fruits.\n6) Therefore, Santino has 212 frits.\nSo the final Answer is 212\n\nInput: What do you do if you see an out of order treadmill in a gym?

This is a cyclical equation.\n3) Vampires do not convert to humans but, instead convert humans into their own kind. This means that at the very least 2 different kinds of persons are in village and, with more vampires entering each night, the number of vampire types will increase. There are only 2 options: all are vampires or some are humans and some are vampires.\n4) Number of vampires = Number of humans (the equation has two unknowns so the equation cannot be satisfied)\n5) The solution can only be satisfied when there are at least 600 total people. Since the population of Willowton is 300, the additional people necessary to satisfy equation must be 300(600/300) people which is 600. This implies that either all 300 persons are turned into vampires or only 2 were human and the rest are all vampires.\n6) A person can only be a vampire or a human. If they are turned into a vampire or they die, then they no longer count as a human. The 5 humans or so die each night and all other living human inhabitants are turned into a vamps. Therefore, no humans left in village. This implies that all vampires are vampires which is 500 vampires (300 people converted 2 nights ago plus 200 converted 1 night ago)\n7) Since there are no more humans and the entire population of the village is vampires, the equation satisfied and 500 vamps total (600 total + 200 from last night + 500 total from last night = 500 from this night)\n8) The answer is 500.\n\nInput: Which of the following words begins with an's'?

Choices: 1. A: to be more flexible. 2. A: to preserve the socks. 3. 3. A: to make them smaller in size. 4. A: because it smells nice outside. 5. A: there could be a fire.\nOutput: 1: To be more flexible: There is no mention of being more flexible. If anything, doing so would only restrict the freedom of movement within the socks.\n2: To preserve the socks: Although it does indeed preserve the socks, that is not the intended purpose. So E is not the answer as it does mention the fact of protection, however it fails to state it is for the intended purpose, which is to preserve the socks but not necessarily preserve them.\n3: To make them smaller in size: No. The opposite occurs. A sock that has been frozen to -15 degrees Celsius (-27 degrees Fahrenheit) will instead be 15% larger upon thawing, due to the expansion of ice crystals.\n4: Because it smells nice outside - As someone who has done this, this is not the reason for frozen socks.\n5: There could be a fire: This is an entirely feasible explanation, but it is not the answer due to it being outside of the question. \n6: The intended answer is the answer that most closely matches the question asked. Since the question is about a person and not what a person may do, it isn't the intended answer. It is to preserve, and preserving would most likely be done as a way to preserve the sock, not as a way of preserving the sock. \nSo the correct answer is: A: to preserve the clothes.\nSo the final correct answer is A: to preserve the clothes.", "answer": " 3"}

If he does not have shoes, he will be extremely cold and the family will not be able to give him theirs. What is the man's name?\n\nOutput: 1) So we can easily deduce that the 12 pairs of shoe might be given to the guest.\n2)The guest does not have shoes hence he is cold.\n3)The man is from a very old and famous family. So his name is definitely long.\n4)The man is visiting a house that is not even his own so it is his brother\u2019s house.\n5)The man has left none for his brother that means he has none at all.\n6)If the man does not have shoes he will be extremely cold, hence the brother cannot even give him the socks that he normally wears when he is in bed.\n7)Since the socks cannot be given, the guest must have brought the socks with him. Hence, the guest must be going for a wedding.\n8)So the answer to question 12 is the name of the guest.

First, let's simplify the quantity that was taken away to further breakdown.\n5. The soda was taken away in the form of 50 plastic.\n6. The sparkling was taken away in the forms of 50 glass and 50 plastic.\n7. The juice was taken in the form of 10 juice, 35 juice, and 25 glass bottles.\n8.

The total number of recycled bottles left are 50 and if we divide it with the total amount of soda taken, it equals 1. So, 1 soda means there is 50 soda bottles left to recycle.\n11. Similarly, same calculations can be done for the remaining items.\n12. Therefore, I end with the answer 59 recyclable can.\n13. Similarly, calculation for juice can be done in similar fashion.\n14.

So when it says 'No one gets an A in class' it is saying that out of 8 people, which is a probability of 1/8, we can not expect a single person to get an A.  If this is the case, the probability of no one getting an A is 0.00125 or 0.125%. The number I'm getting seems to be too long so 0.12 is the closest possible number.

{"idx": 925, "text": "1. It is evident that the solution lies in estimating the time required to complete the task of washing all the laundry.\n2. However, estimating this is quite challenging.\n3. Each load of lauqndry is estimated to take 45 minutes for the wash cycle and one hour for the dry cycle, which makes it 90 minutes in total.\n4. However, these are estimates that are not absolute and will definitely not be as simple as rounding up the duration of each cycle and then multiplying them together.\n5. For example, let's say, the first load takes 45 minutes instead of one hour for the dry phase.\n6. That will make the total time taken for this load 60 minutes. (Wash = 45 minutes, then dry = remainder time of 60 minutes)\n7. The second load would then have 45 minutes of wash and 75 minutes of dry, total time taken 120 minutes.\n8. This pattern would continue so that the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th load would take 45, 60, 75, 90 and 105 minutes respectively.\n9. The 6th load could theoretically take more time than 105 minutes and would actually end up taking 110 minutes, while the wash cycle would still be a round 45 minutes, because the dry cycle would be longer.\n10. This pattern will further continue till the 8th load, which would take longer to finish than the previous loads, because the wash cycle is now 1 hour and 45 minutes, whereas the dry cycle is still 1 hour.\n11. However, we are not dealing with theoretical scenarios, which is why we need to consider a worst-case scenario for each load.\n12. So, if we consider all the worst-case scenarios in terms of time, we get that the 6th take is 100 minutes, the 7th is 105 minutes, the 8th is 109 minutes (2 hours 9 minutes) and the 9th is 110 minutes.\n13.

Animal and male, A: man, seem like likely answers but they're also not necessarily less likely to be kind, and anyway, animals are people too.\n3.

The question states that Malcom has 8 extra cards than Brandon at the start. Since there are a total of 20 cards to begin with, Malcom must have 28 cards initially, while Brandon has only 12. Then, Malcom gives half of those cards to his friend Mark, leaving him with 14 cards in the end.\n  Lastly, determine the number of cards Brando has in comparison to Malcom\u2019s 14 (which amounts to 66 cards in total), and the answer turns out to be 42.

{"idx": 934, "text": "The question asks for the number of feet climbed by John when he climbs three staircases with different numbers of steps.\n2. The first staircase of 20 steps has a height of 10 ft.\n3. The steps in the next staircase are doubles than in the first one, so each step represents 0.5 * 2 = 1ft and its total height is 10ft as well.\n4. The last staircase is 1 step less than the second one and each stair represents 0.5 feet, hence, it has a total height of 5 ft.\n5. John climbs 3 stairs of height 20 + 20 + 10 = 50 ft, which means he climbed a total of 50ft.\n6. Since the steps in each staircase represent 0.5 ft each, John climbs a total of 5ft + 5 ft + 5 ft = 15ft.\n7. Thus, John climbs 50 + 15 = 65 ft.\n8. Therefore, John climbs a grand total of 65 feet.\nSo the final answe is 65 ft\n\nInput: What is 200 + 40 as a percent? Choices: 131.5% 150% 200% 300% 400%\nOutput: 1.

Each bag contains 60 cools, each coal burns for 15 minutes, so the number of bags of coals is equal to the number of bags to burn 15 minutes of coals.\n3. When the time to burn 3 bags of coals, the grill runs for long enough to burn 3 times 60=180 coals, and the coals burn for 15 minutes each so the grill runs for 3 times 15 = 45 minutes.\n4. The grill burned the bag without ash for 20 minutes on one round and for another 45 minutes on the second round for total 65 minutes.(1 round = 65 minutes)\n5. The total time when the grill is burning coal can be expressed using the following formula: Ttotal = T1 + T2 where T1 (1st time) is the period of time required to burn 1 bag and T2 (2nd time) is the period when the grill is running after the first bag.\n6. In our example, it is equal to 20 minutes 65 minutes 60 coals burning=45 minutes 180 coals burning. 7. From the above example, the period of time when the grill runs is 65 minutes.\n8.

Since the dough is 12 inches x 12 inches, the total surface area is: 12 x 12 = 144 square inches.\n3. Now that we know the total surface area of the dough, we need to determine how many square inches are available for each biscuit.\n4. To do this, we need to understand the relationship between the biscuit size and the dough.\n5. Each biscuit is 12 inches wide by 12 inches tall; we can write this as 3 inches by 12 in, or 3 x 12 =36.\n6. The relationship between the dough and the biscuit can be written as\n36 = 144/n, where n is the number of biscuits we can make with this dough.\n7. Since we can make six biscuits with this dough, n = 144:6 = 24.\n8. This means that there are 24 square inches of dough per biscuit.\n9.

{"idx": 976, "text": "10. The number of free throws is determined by applying these variables.\n11. The 70% represents the likelihood of successfully hitting the free throw. It means that after 10 free throws, the player would miss 3 free throws.\n12. The 2 shots for every foul implies that the player gets 2 free throws after fouling 2 times.\n13. The 5 fouls per 20 games implies that the player gets to shoot 3 free throws per game\n14. Therefore, we can derive the total number of free throws the player gets in 80% if they play 20 games, which is equivalent to about 16 games.\n15. Therefore, the total number of free throw is 16.0 * 3 = 48.\n16. There are 10 foul shots in 48, which means that the total number of foul shots is 0.22 * 10 = 2.2.\n17. Hence, the total number of foudns in 80%of 16 games is 80% * 2.2 = 1.76.\n18. And so the total number of points in 80% when the player plays 16 times is 16 * 1.76 = 28.48.\nSo the final output should be the total number of points given the numbers of free throws(28.48).\nSo the final output will be 28.448.", "answer": " 112"}

So the question implies all unicorns are moving at the same time.\n5. Hence, the first part of the question is \"Trip\" should be replaced by \"time\".\n6. The second part of the question is everytime a unicorn moves forward.\n7. The third part of the question should be 6 or three times 6. (the question does not mean six times, but 6 times)\n8.

{"idx": 998, "text": "1) First, we identify that the number of fish Ittymangnank receives in the end will be the total fish amount minus the Oomyapeck's eyes.\n\n2) Since the amount of fish Ittymagnark and Kingnook each receives at the end can both be expressed as a fraction of the total fish amount, we can start thinking of these two quantities to solve this.\n3)  Since Oomyapeck has eaten 22 eyes from the start, then we will know that the amount of fish after Ittymangnk eats 22 is 1982.\n\n4) Since Ittymangnars and Kingnook cannot share a number that is greater than a whole number between themselves (in case Oomyapeck had eaten 23 or 24 eyes in a day), it would be the one that could be divided evenly by both.\n5) This number must then be divided by 1982 (to identify how many times the fish can get divided into) and divided by 3 (to identify the final fish amount that should be given to each of the two of them).\n\n6) Hence, the total fish amount to be given to each of Ittymagnak and Kingnook can be calculated as 1/3 of 211/1982 or 1/3 of (21*1982)/1982. i.e., 1/3 of the total fish amount - 22/21.\n\n7) This can be simplified as (1982) / 3 - (22) / 21. Therefore, each of Ittymangnarks and Kingnook will each receive (1960) / 3.\n\n8) Since, 1960 is a whole number, they will both receive exactly that as their final fish amount. \n\nHence, the answer is (1960 / 3), each of Ittymankgnarks and Kingnook is given 1960/3 for their fish. \n\nSo the final answer to this math question is (196 / 3)", "answer": " 4"}
{"idx": 999, "text": "Solving the formula for t to get the solution is given below\n\nGt = GT( 60) / 1.6 = 37.75734  t = 37.8 minutes\n\nThe given question states that Lydia has a pool with a capacity of 60 gallons. The pool is filled using a hose at a rate of 1.5 gallons per minute. Unfortunately, the pool has a small leak that drains water at the rate of.1 gallon a minute. We need to determine the time it takes for Lydia's pool to reach full capacity from the given information.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can set up a basic differential equation like this:\n\nGt + (0.1) = G(60) / 7.5\n\nIn this equation the left-hand side is the total number of gallons in the pool and the right-hand side is the number of gallons coming in per minute as a result of filling the pool. Let's say 'r' is 'G', which is the rate at which the water in the pool increases. We have a total initial volume of our pool, 'v', with the total amount of water coming in each minute, 'F', and then the rate of growth of our pool, 'r', which is the rate multiplied by the current volume of the pool. This formula can be used to find out how much water is in the pool after a given amount of time, assuming that the tank or pool is always full and the rate at which the pool is growing is constant.\n\nThe given equation can be represented in several ways.\nGt (1 + 0.1) = 60.\n\nWe just divide both sides and by 60 or 60/60 which is 1\n60t (1 + 1.6) = 60\n\nNext, we multiply both sides of the equation by -60:\nGt = GT (60) / 60 = GT (1)\n\nTo solve this equation for t, we cross multiply: ((1) * 60) = t\nThus, 37.77/37.77 = t\n\nAnswer = 37.6 minutes\n\nSo the final answer as 37.6 as an approximation", "answer": " 40"}

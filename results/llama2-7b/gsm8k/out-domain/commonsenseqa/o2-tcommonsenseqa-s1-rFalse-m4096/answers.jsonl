A: A B: B C: C D: D E: Z\nOutput: A: A\n\n#### Explanation/Solution:\nThe first question, and only question, in the Python list is asking the user for input, or for what they want to find. If the user types \"A\", then one of the user's options is the only right answer.\n\nSimilar to the first question, the second question asks the user for input. One of the user's option is to input \"A\", which is the correct answer based off of the question.\n\nThe third question involves multiplication, and if the user knows the concept of multiplication, it will be pretty easy to solve. Using Python, we can do a pretty simple \"if\" and \"else\" statement that will determine the users answer as either 12 or 12.\n\nThe fourth question also involves multiplication. 100 divided by 3 in Python is \"100 / 3\", which when divided by 5, the answer is \"33\" or \"one, zero, three\".\n\nThe last question uses division and another \"if\" and \" else\" structure to make up its answer.

If a number is divisible by ten, it's divisible by two and four at the same. If a number is not divisible\nby five, it's also not divisible by ten unless the number is 2005 or 2006. When calculating a number for the sixth division, there are two things to consider: whether the number is divisible by 2005, 2006, a\npositive number and a negative number.\n\nExample:\nIf a number has a remainder of 2 when it's divided by two, it means the number is not divisible by two. A number with a remainder of 7 when it's divided\nby five means it's divisible, since it is a remainder. If a number divisible by two is also divisible by ten, a remainder of one when divided by ten means the number is not dividable by ten, since it is a\nremainder. A negative number is divisible by two when the number is divisible with two, a plus one when it's divisible with ten, while a positive\nnumber is divisible by two if the number is divisible or plus three.\n\nIf the number is divisible, it is the sum of the remainder of the two first divisions, the remainder of the two middle divisions and the remaining quotient after the sixth division.\n\nIf the positive number is not divisible, the sum of the remainder and the left-over quotient of the first five divisions will always be divisible.\nOutput: If a number is not dividable, it's also divisible by ten.\n#### Input: Find the values of the variables: a and b.\n```\n    a + b = 32\n    a^2 - 19a + 15b**2 = 216\n    (a-2)^2 + (b + 1)^2 = 1\n```\nOutput: a = 1.897, b = -0.57\n#### Input: If a person takes $11.00 grocery store and saves $9.00, how much is spent on groceries?\nOutput: $3.00\n#### Input: If", "answer": " 300"}

We can assume that we are thirsty so we wouldn't find our own home where there is water fountain.\nFor the second question, the answer is D. An average of 20 on the entire week is 160. 50 on the first day of the week is 100. Twice as much is 200. Now from there we are doing math to figure out the other two days. Adding the 200 together is 360 and taking away 160 is 200 which leaves about 140 people who visit the library each day. \nFor the third question, the answer is E. 85/7= 12, 102/7= 14.5, 160/7= 22, 85/7 = 12, 37/7= 5.3.

In mathematics, if you solve for the variable of interest, you then get the other variables. So, for this problem, you find every number for a variable. That way you will know everything that you need. It is a way to find what numbers will not be of use to someone who is thirsty. For example, if you find the number for wall and show, you can find out that \"a\" is not an answer. Also, I found every variable, one at a time. So 26 + 24 + 28 + 22 + 2 = 108. Then 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. In this example, you can say that 26 is an even number.\n\nIn the second number sentence, we have a whole different scenario. In this situation, they have given us certain scenarios and they have given us what we are assuming each one means. They assume that when a person is beginning work they are not working. Also, I did not think that they may assume a person who is accomplishing could not be accomplishing so I just wrote down what I see as their logic.  So, after a careful breakdown of the sentence, we find that the only options that make sense are resting, tiredness, and momentum. Resting, which will make the person tired.

A is always B.\n\nInput: B:E\nWe need to convert \"A\" to \"B\", and convert \"E\" to 7 (it is the same as \"B\" but reverse).\n\nThe first char is \"A\", so we use E to substitute by reversing every item and subtract E from 26 (the number of letters) to count the number of remaining letters, 65. That would be the second char in the conversion if char is an int.\n\nThe second char is E, so we take 5 and add 7, 12, then subtract it from 26 to get the number of remaining letters.\n\nWhen you get the sum, just do the multiplication operation, but make sure you convert to int before dividing. Otherwise the division will fail.\n\n### Source\n[github](https://github.com/vhf/job-interview-universal-converter)\n[leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problems/converting-binary-to-decimal/)", "answer": " 4"}

The answers are as follows:\na) 95 \u2103\nb) boil\nc) \u2267 95 \u2b07 100 \u2103\nd) 130 \u2b07 5 \u2103/minute\n\n15 \u2103 is the ideal temperature for a human body. If the temperature drops below that, the body starts shivering, and if it goes above, the body starts to sweat.\n\nSo 130 \u00f7 5 = 0.26 seconds. Which means we should wait for around 2.6 seconds for the food to fully cook after boiling.\n\nNow to answer the last question, we need to understand what does this mean. To understand this, we will take the case on the right and left of the equal sign.\nHere, for b) boil, we understand that food needs to be boiled in order to cook it. So, the food can get cooked any temperature at or greater than 100 \u200b\u2103.\n\nBut for a) 95 \u200b\u2103, if a human puts their hand at 95 \u200b\u200b\u2103 for more than 0.1 seconds, they can burn. So, the food must not exceed the temperature of 95 \u200b(degrees) C for more than 0,1 seconds.\n\nWhen we look at d), food can get cooked by adding one unit \u200b\u200bat a time (in order to prevent food from being overcooked), but this is not the case for b).

How many photos do I have left?\nOutput:D: 1 photo\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 8 math question\nInput:There are 5 people in a restaurant.  There are 13 chairs spread out over two tables in the restaurant. If each person sits down in a different chair, how many ways can the 5 people sit down?\nOutput:B.760 ways.\n**My answer:**\nIn the first table there are 2 empty seats.  The table with 2 empty seats holds 2 people.  In the table with 3 seats total, we can put 3 people.  We put 1 person in first  empty seat and then leave 2 other people in their seat while 2 other people sit together in the 3 seat row.  So the table with 3 empty seats holds 4 people.  Total of 1 table with 2 people and one with 4 people.  6 people total.\nIn the second table there are 9 empty seats.  The tables with 9 empty seats also can hold 2 people who sit together.  So we can put 2 people in the table with 9 empty seats.  1 empty seat left.  We put 2 people in each of these 7 empty chairs.  We leave 1 person.  So we left 1 person in there to keep the number of people the same.  Total of 2 tables with 2 people each and one with 1 person.  1 person missing out of 9. We have to have one person missing.  So 7 people total.\n\nTotal of 8 people and 7 chairs.  That leaves 1 chair empty.  We end up with 6 people at the 1st table and 7 people left over to sit at the second table.  7 * 6 = 42 ways to seat people.  But we already added 6 into the 1st table.  Subract 6 from 7 left and we get 1. 42+1 = 43 ways to seat people.\n\n\n\n\n**My answer: **\nInput:When the doctor wants someone to be ready at a certain time he/", "answer": " 14"}

If you think someone needs an introduction to the concept (which is how I learned), or you just really want to flex your grammar muscle, write a paragraph about the concept (as though to anyone who hasn't already been introduced to it) - and maybe link to the Wikipedia article on it. This also goes without saying but it's a good idea to proofread and format your paragraph with paragraph breaks and capital letters. Don't overdo it though, and don't be greedy!\n\n\n\n### Sample Input:\n\n  A: curtaines\n  B: tailor shop (The answer)\n  C: clothing store\n  D: sewing room\n  E: hardware store\n\n### Sample Output:\n\n  B: tailoeshop\n\n\n### Sampe Input:\n\n  Tailor shop\n\n\n### Output:\n\n  * B: tailor shop \n\n\n### Input:\n\n  Which of your friends are likely to show up to a party a little early or at least a little on time?\n\n### Output\n\n  E : Dinner parties \n\n\n## About\nHello,\n\nThis is a project made by a high-school student, 511140864@gmail.com.

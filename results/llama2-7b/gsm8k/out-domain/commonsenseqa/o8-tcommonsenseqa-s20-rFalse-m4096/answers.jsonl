{"idx": 884, "text": "Solution\nThe question is asking you to determine how many bolts, nuts, and total number of items used for the project.  One step in the process is to subtract the number of unused items remaining from the total for the project, and this will give you the number of items used.  So the first subtraction is 7 - 6 = 1.  The next subtraction is 3 + (3*15) = 45.  There was a surplus of 44 because each box contained, 11 bolts for a total of 77, so we subtract that from 45, which gives us a surplus of 18 that you can account for.  Now, 3 boxes contained 15 nuts each, which yields a total of 45 nuts.  Remember that there is one unused nut left over, bringing the total number to 46.  So to determine the total number of items the builder used, we subtract the two totals with nuts and bolts (45 + 46, 91).  Therefore, the builder used 91 total items, which he was able to accomplish in 6 days.\n\nInput: John was getting ready to attend an event when his friend Joe called him.  Joe had an assignment for a new job and said, \"Sorry I'm too busy this weekend, but I'm having 6 steaks with this group, so I'll bring some extra for you.\" How many steaks would Joe bring for himself?\nOutput:\nSolutiion\nTo determine how many steaks John was bringing, subtract one from the number that Joe originally said. Now, we can determine the result of the whole expression as 6 with the subtraction of the original 7.\n\nInput: How many items were in a set of 8 cups sold by the restaurant?\nOutput:\n\nSolution\nTo determine the total number of cups sold, we subtract the original number of cups by a single cup.

When at last she arrived at her friend's house, she found that the sky was not grey, but blue, and there were no clouds in sight. Her friend had brushed her hair and washed her face.

But be warned that this is an easy puzzle, so it can be solved by any reasonable computer.\n\n### Your task\n> Write a program that solves the puzzles for the grade \"A\". The program can assume that the input for each \"math question\" is valid. But there are many such inputs that aren't valid - for example, for question 4, how should the number of cookies that Sabrina has at the end be determined, if she has 4 or 6 cookies.\n\n### How do I submit the solution?\n> For each question, I'll post the input, and you post the output. If there are two answers, I'll ask you to pick one of them to be the solution.\n\n### Rules for solving\n> Don't just guess. Try to discover the solution. I'd like you to solve problem after problem even if they're trivial, so that you gain the ability to do this type of problem solving by discovering rules. But if you have a solution for a problem you've never seen, don't post it - you can just ask me about the specific input you have, and I'll see what the solution I'm looking for is.\n\n### Questions and answers\n> Ask me additional questions here. I'll keep track of them and work through them when I feel like it by using this markdown table. I'll leave the table blank, and if you have a question or want to comment something, just leave a comment on a row, to indicate that I should put some response to that question into that row.\n\n\n| Question | Input | Output |\n| ------ | --------- | ---------- |\n| #1 | A | A: box |\n| #2 | A | D: gas station |\n| #3 | A | B: bedroom |\n| #4 | A | D: petrol station |\n| #5 | A | D: car |\n| #6 | A | D: mediterranean |\n| #7 | A | C: aquarium |\n| #8 | A | A: mediterranean Sea |\n| #9 | A | E: tree |\n| #10 | A | B: hill |\n| #", "answer": " 5"}

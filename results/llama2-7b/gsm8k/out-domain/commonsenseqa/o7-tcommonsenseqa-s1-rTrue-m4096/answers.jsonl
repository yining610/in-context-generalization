{"idx": 27, "text": "1. Jack's objective is to collect salt to season his fish because he is stranded on an island and has no other source of salt.\n2. Jack wants to season his fish, so he needs to collect salt which requires water evaporation.\n3. First, the ratio of salt, i.e., sodium chloride, per liter is 23.0 grams.\n4. Jack collects 2 litres of sea water, so he has to consume that sea water. Therefore, the ratio of moles of salt is n/v if he has to gather 2 moles of sodium chloride in all. \n5. Hence, the formula to solve is N/V =Mole Ratio * (Percent by Volume)\n6. If the water is diluted with excess sea water, then: `2L / 20%` and `2L / 80%`\n7. Therefore: `2L / (20/100)` => `(N/V) =(1/20*20g` => `=(1/20)`\n8. If the evaporation happens in an ideal evaporator, then the total moles of salt remain constant.\n9. The answer comes out to be `1/20*61.064g=30.532g` meaning that each liter of sea water contains 30.6g of salt.\n10. In all, when the water evaporates, Jack collects `2/100` of the total moles of water but all of the `30.6g` present in that volume.\n11.

Among the given options, A is 4Runner, B is Explorer, and C is Tundra. We have to find out among these which is more expensive.\n3.)

Similarly, the F150 costs $28,000 so the price of the F150 is a little bit higher than the price of the Explorer. This allows us to conclude that F150 is more expensive.\n6.) We arrive at 4Runner as the answer because 4Runner is the most expensive given in the options after F150. 4Runner is more pricey than the F150. Therefore, 4Runner costs more than the price of F150.

So we have to choose one out of two answers, either four or eight.\n12.Since we don't know what the fourth part is, let's try eight since it is easier to calculate eight twenty percent and nine is easy to get as eighty-two is a lot easier to deal with than getting ten and two.\n13.Let's subtract eight twenty percent and nine, which gives us as our answer eight.\nSo the final answers are 8.

The first two options include the 25 people mentioned in the question, so they do not help us solve the problem as they are not independent variables. \n4. Option C does describe the total number of cuts but does not state that it has already been made, and it is possible that \n   the person made more than 30 cuts which would result in less slices being shared. \n5.

If we use the formula (6 gumballs) = (N + 1)/N, we get\n9.\n(6 gumballs =  (4 + 1)/5\nand substituting the values gives\n10.\n(6gumballs = (5 + 1)/5 = ((5 + 1)/(5 + 1)) =  ((4)/((5 + 1))) = (4/((6)) = ((3)/((5 + 5))) = ((3)/((2))) = ((3)/2) )\n\n\n11.\nSo the final total number from the second part would be\n\n12.\n((3/2)*(4) )\n\n13.\n(Total number of gummy beers =  ((3/2)*(8) )\n\nSo the final answer to the question is\n\n14.\n(37)", "answer": " 45"}
{"idx": 100, "text": "1. The given problem uses mathematical operations like addition, multiplication, and subtraction to solve it.\n2. The question asks about the number of additional fish that Gail has in the first tank as compared to the second tank. This suggests that she already has at least some fish in one of the tanks and is adding more as well as some fish is removed. This implies the tank counts remain incremental throughout the problem.\n3. We need to apply the rule of the number of fish in one tank to the other tank, therefore, we can ignore the second tank and solve just for the first tank.\n4. We have, First tank 2 times the size of the second -> 1 inch of fish = 1 gallon of water.\n5. We have a total of 48 gallons for 48 inches of fish\n6. There are 2 inch fish in the second tank, so divide 40 by 2. For every 2 -inch fish in the second tent, there will be 1 -inch fish in the first. We already have 1 inch fish in the first\n7. She has a total of 54 inch fish in the tank, and we want to add more (3 inch) fish to the first tank. She will add 3 fish to each of the tanks. Subtract from 54 the number of 3 inch fish (2 fish in the first and 1 fish in the second)\n8. We will get the answer 4 gallons\n9. Option B :10 - 9 gallons = 1 gallon\n10.

We can determine this by dividing the total number of trips through the lake in one day by the maximum number of seats available per boat trip on that given day.\n\nWe\u2019ll do this by using this information:\n  -there are 4 trips through during a day.\n  -the boat can take up to a maximum of 12 people per boat ride.\n  -therefore, the total number of people carrying a boat trip per day is 12/4 = 3.\n2.To find our answer, we need to multiply the number from the previous step by two.\n\nSo, two trips x 12 people =24\n\nHence, the boat can carry 24 people in one day or through one trip.\n\n3.Moving on to another day, we\u2019ll multiply the previous day\u2019s number by two.\n\nTwo trips x 14 people =28.\n\nThus, the boat can carry up to 28 people in a day.\n\nHence, since the boat can take a maximum number of people of only 12 per boat ride, 28 people would be the upper limit to the number of people who can take a boat ride in total in two days.\n\n4.Lastly, we just need to multiple that by 2.\n28 x 2 = 56\n\nTherefore, the boat can take a minimum of 56 people across 2 days.\n\nThus the answer to this question is 56.\n\n\nInput: How many times does the person have to go down a small staircase in order to arrive at the bottom from the top of the staircase?

The question states that Larry spends half an hour and a fifth of an hour feeding his dog each day.\n3.

This means that Larry spends a total of (30+5) minutes feeding his dog every day, or (half of 30 + half of 5).\n5. Hence, Larry spends 75 minutes (or a fifth of an hour) each day feeding his dog on two different occasions.\nSo the final solution is 75 minutes\n\nInput:The man is not on an airplane, it was an accident. Which kind of flight are you on? Choices:  bus A: plane B: carrier C: train D: fighter E: zeppelin\nOutput: 1 : This question asks to identify the kind of flight, since you are not on a particular kind of flight.\n2. Since the question specifies that it was an accident, which means that circumstances beyond the person's control led to being where they are.\n3. They weren't on an airplane, so they must be on one of the other kinds of flights, train, fighter, etc.\n4. This leaves us with the options A: plane, B: carrier, C: train, D: fighter, and E: zeppelin.\n5. Since the man didn't intend to be on any of these kinds of flights, by definition, the answer cannot be plane A or carrier B.\n6. It is also clear that the man isn't on a train as they were in an accident.\n7. The only remaining choices that make sense are D: fighter, as it refers to flying machines, and E: zepplin, another type of flying machine.\n8. Hence, the answer can be either D: fighter, or E: zepplin. If the question was more specific, like a military fighter jet like F-16 or a Zeppelin, we could further narrow down the answer.\nSo the final answers are either D: fighter or E: zeppilin.\n\nInput: What doesn't the cat have that the bird", "answer": " 72"}

{"idx": 144, "text": "If Toby knows how many goldfish are at the top of the pond, then he can use the law of averages to estimate the number at the bottom. If he is confident that 25% of 15 is equal to 3.75, he can approximate the number of fish below the surface. Let's see how he can do it. We have 15 goldfish in the pond, and if we subtract the number of fish beneath the surface from the total, we'll have 25% of what is left. 25% of the 15 goldfish is 3.75. This gives us a better approximation of how many fish are below the surface than saying that 15% are.

The question further clarifies that, to fulfill this obligation, she must deliver 27 packages and combined meals.\n3. Using the equation method, dividing 27 packages by 8 packages, Angela was required to deliver: Number of packages = 27 divided by 8, which in an integer can be written as: 27/8.\n4. Now, to find the meals part, let me tell you that when we do the division, both 27 and 8 are divisors so 27/8 = 3 in integer form.\n5. This means, to fulfill her obligations, Angela is required to deliver 3 times the number of meals she delivers packages to.\n6. Hence the answer to the question lies in finding: number of meals she needs to deliver = 3 x number of meals she has delivered packges.\n7. Now, let's understand how she has delivered packages. She has delivered 8 packages and meals combined, which is twice as many as meals.\n8. Let's multiply the equation, 3 x 8, and this is how 3 times 8 equals to 24 and 3 x 27 = 81.\n9.

By looking at the given information, we know that Tim's doctor's visit costs $300 ($300 = $300) and his pet insurance covers $60 (75% = 0.75), leaving $240 ($300 - $60) of Tim's bill to be covered by him.\n2. The cat's visit is $120 ($120 = $120).  His pet insurance covers $0.75/3 = $0.25.  His total bill, therefore, is $120 + $0.25 = $120.25.\n3. If his total bill is 240 - 120.26, he must have paid 120.74 himself.\n4. The question is asking us to find the amount he paid, and to do that, we must first find how much of the bill his insurance covers.\n5. We know that 0.25/0.75 = 0.335, so his insurance covers 0.334 of his bill.\n6. Therefore 0.33 of the bill is $100.35 = 121.06 (0.334 * 120.00 = 42.00, or rounded to the nearest whole cent).\n7. This leaves him with one-third of the bill that he must cover, which is $120.70.  His doctor' bill also cost him $240.\n8. Putting it all together: his total bill is $300 + $120.        25 = $420.75.  He must cover 0.75/0.74 = 0.996 $25 of it ($440.75 - $120. 74 = $320).\n9.

Now in order to do this we have to make the total 45. (39+6=45).Now from the number of beads we have to remove one equal number of beads form each equal part. 6 So to make 45 we need to remove: 6-1 from each part means 5 beads removed. 7 As in total we need to make equal parts so we can remove 1 bead from every part(i) and double every part so that we make equal part, so now every part will have one more bead than initial number of beads in every part. 8 Now we can remove 6-5 from every part from the total of 45. (45-13)= 32 beads to be removed now. 9 As we have already subtracted 5 beads so now we have to remove 5 from each part to make 6 in every part and we have to remove only 7 beads, i.e 23 - 1 = 22 blue beads from each part to be able to make 6 in each equal part. 10 Now we can remove 5 from every part so that we will add 1 to every part and will get remaining 5 beads. 11 Now our total will be 20(blue)+2(yellow)= 22 beads. 12 So in each part, we are going to have 6 bead of blue 6 bead of yellow. Now let s consider the number of total beads 22 bead in each part. 13 This means in total we had", "answer": " 10"}

{"idx": 182, "text": "1) A tree can be given a measured height and a growing speed. The tree's height and speed can then be considered independent values. \n2) Our main question in this problem is how long the tree has grown from the year 2017 to the year 2020. \n3) The given data is sufficient to determine the value of years needed for the growth. The rate of increase is given as 10%, which is 0.10. \n4) To understand how this 10% growth works, we need to rephrase it as a time, which would be added to the 100 meters. \n5) That gives us 100*0.10 or 10 meters more than the initial height. \n6) We can then continue the chain for how much it grows in a year: (10+10*0.1) = 111.00. \n7) This means we add 10 meters every year, so we also go up by 1 meter. \n8) So from year 2018 to 2019, we'll go up by one meter and in 2019 itself, we have already gained 10 meters or 0.10 of that year. \n9) This implies: in 0.10 years, we have gained 30 or 0.1*30=30 more meters. \n10) This means in 1 more year, we will have gone up by 31 meters. \n11) We can therefore state: \nin 2017, we have traveled 100 meters; in 0.1 years, we have gained another 30 or 1*30. \nTherefore in 2018, we reach 130 meters (0.13 m, 1*30). \n12) Now if we follow the same pattern: in the second 0.1 years we will gain 130/13 or 10 meters, which would make us reach 140 meters in the third year, with the final value of 151 meters after two and a half more years. \n13) Since we are only interested in how far the tree", "answer": " 21"}

For the next 3 weeks, the period is increased to 3 weeks = 7 appled to be eaten for the next 3 weeks and over these three weeks, he eated 3 x 7 weeks = 21 apples for the first three weeks.\n4. Now, the question is, over these 7 weeks, he ate the same number of appels as the total of the previous two weeks.\n5. So, 7 weeks = the previous 2 weeks.\n6. So, the solution is 21 apples.\n7. This can be verified directly by dividing the total number of apples consumed over all 7 weeks by 7 which is 7 divided by 7 = 1 which confirms that he ate exactly 1 apple every week for 7 weeks. Hence, the answeris that archibald eats 7 apples in total per week.\nSo the final answers is 7\n\nInput: A man takes an unplanned trip around the world at an average speed that is equal to what fraction of an avian?

According to the question: \"match Joey Chestnut\u2019s record of eating\" \n4.

We can create two variables (x) for the drops of a solution used and (y) for the number of beakers without copper.\nUsing set-precedence, we can break this problem into n variables :\n\nn = number of beakers with Copper ions\nx = number of drops of solution used\ny = number of beakers without Copper ions\n\nNow that we've defined our variables, we can set n = 8 or the number of beakers in our question. We can plug the values into the statement and replace n with the appropriate number.\n\n45 x = y +3 which means we need 45 more drops. Because we've got 8 test containers, we will use them and add 3 drops to each. If none of the beakers tested had copper, we won't have 45 drops and can use x =8 or just 1 drop for each beaker to solve. We will start by solving for y, which is easy because we know n = 8 and the problem states that y = 45 - x, so y = 45 if x = 0 and y = 45 after using x = 8 since it states to use 3 drops for every container with copper ions, which leaves us with 45 minus x or y.\n\nNow plugging the values in as we did above it comes out as y = 8.\n\nNow that we know what y is, we can plug it back into 45 x = y+3 to get 45 x = 8+3 which comes out to 38 drops. This is the amount used with the final solution because we started with 8 beakers then added the 3 drops solution.\n\nIf the beakers are tested 1 by 1, this number will decrease and since we know we started with 8, 45 drops will have been used for two more tests and 43 drops will be left of the 45 solution if done 1 by 1.\n\nSo to find the number of beakers, we replace 45 drops = to 38 and get n= 12 which means the answer", "answer": " 7"}

Since he asks his parents for additional trains every year, we can set a function to represent this as: G(x)=x+2  where x is the number of trains Max has at the end of the xth year.  In the first year, x=0 and G(x)=0+2, which is 2. In the second year, x=1, G(x)=1+2, which is also 2. In the 3rd year, G(x)=3.  So, in the 5th year G(x)=5.  Since he always gets what he asks for, we have G(x)=x.  So there are a total of 30 trains in 5 years.  During the 5th year, however, they are giving him double the number of models he already has, so after they finished giving him the present they double the amount.\nThis means G(x) will get doubled too, since G=x.  So, G(G(x))=2G(x), which means this G(x)=32.  Finally, G(6)=264.  So, G=x^6-1. \nNow we can plug in our base case, x=2, and calculate:  G(2)=2^6 -1 = 29. \nHence, the answer is A.\n\nInput: A new teacher got a job as a teacher at a middle school and he realized he was in for much more than he was ready for.

{"idx": 251, "text": "1. The question states that Tom uses 10 plates each weighs 30 pounds and the machine uses special technology to increase the weight by a further 20% on the lower portion. The question itself does not give any extra information so we should try to deduce from the given statement what is the answer. \n2. Our assumption should be that the machine should be able to increase the effective weight of each plate by 20% (0.2) so when used the load feels 20% heavies on the lowering portion of each plate. \n3. For example, if Tom used the 30-pound weights (10 in total), then in total, each plate contributes to 0.3 kg. However, due to the special technology, this weight feels more than it is which translates to each plate increasing the lowering load by 20% so 0.3 x 0.2 = 0.06 kg.\n3. Therefore, each plate's load increases by 0.06kg due to the special technology so if on top of 10 x 0.3 = 3kg is added, then it would feel like someone carrying a total weight of 3.06 kg. \n4. However, there is more than one instance that the weights are going down so the total weight that needs to be considered is T, where T = 10T = 10 x T. \n5. So solving for T: T = T. And since the T = 10 x weight so 10T = (10 x T) so T = 10. \n6. Therefore the load Tom is feeling when being lowered has a total weight of T = 10 kg. \n\nInput: What can you get from buying a large muffin?

{"idx": 252, "text": "1. One hour can yield 12 pies in this bakery, with a total of 12x3 or 36 pieces being made and sold. \n2. 36 pies with each piece costing $4, means that the bakery would make 36x4 dollars or 144 dollars during one hour. \n3. 144 dollars would be made if each pie were sold completely during that hour and given the option to do so.\n4. However, since the pies are selling for $4 apiece, the bakery would only get half as much money or $72 dollars for the entire hour. \n5. In this case, in addition to generating revenue from each pie, the bakery also loses a part of the baking cost in the form of raw materials and production.\n6. We can determine this cost from our option 6: considering the bakery would sell all the 36 pies, the money that the bakery is paying to the resources required to make a single pie would be $54.\n7. We can get $108 dollars of revenue from selling all the pies plus $54 of cost. Therefore, the profit per hour is:  $54 divided by 1 hour = $54 divided by $60. Therefore, profit per hour is $67.50 dollars.\n    So the final answer is Option 9\n\nInput: Which of the following isn\u2019t part of a well?

Choices: A: lift weights C: practice yoga D: run a marathon B: exercise E: play tug of war\nOutput: 1) This question implies that the doctor is recommending an activity for the patient to avoid over exhaustion, or exertion. \n2) This would suggest that the activity for the prevention of over-exertion would be in some way more minimal, or less strenuous to avoid over-exertion. \n3) Looking at the activity options which were listed, the choices of yoga, marathon, and tug of war would be somewhat minimal with respect to exertion, but none of them would be sufficient as the activity suggested by the doctor. \n4) This leaves us with B: exercise as the most plausible option.\n5) This is because playing tug of war is a somewhat strenuous activity with respect to exerting muscular force, C: practice yoga - while minimal in terms of exerted force over a long period of time - as a form of exercise, is still more of a form of passive bodily movement and not strictly exercise. And \n6) finally, D: run a marathons - is a rather extreme form of endurance running that involves a high amount of exertion, and not in any way a form of minimal exertion, which would be the requirement of the doctor.\n7) Hence, our final answer is B: exercise.\n\nInput:Jasper spent 16 hours doing what?

Choices:  a) 6 m b) 60 m c) 166 m d) 1660 m \nOutput: 1 The question mentions that a dog travels at the speed of 1 meter every second. The dog travels 6 meters every second, which means that a dog will travel a total of 6 meters in 1 second. At this speed, a dog will cover 6 meters every second and 6 seconds in 1 minute. Therefore, a dog will travel a minimum of the following distance in 1 minute: 6 seconds x 6 meters per second = 36 meters in 1 minute. By simplifying the above formula to get the final value, 36 meters can be easily interpreted as 360 meters per minute.

C. the same\nOutput: 1) The question explicitly asks which is closer to the plane. 2) Since it is the height of the city rather than the width, option A is a valid inference and Inequivalent. 3) So a plane flying from one city with height equal to width (such cities do exist) flies at any point at the same height, it is at the same height throughout the whole trip, it is at the height of the city. 4) This rule applies for cases where the height and width of the city are the same (i.e., where the size of the city is of the shape of a cylinder, like a hose). 5) This is because the height is always the same distance from the ground, no matter where the plane takes off from.

{"idx": 301, "text": "1). The question states that it costs $.10 to make the first page, so the cost for each additional page is $.10.\n2. To make sure that Jenny understands exactly how much she would need to pay, the question continues by stating that she needs to print 7 copies, in total, of her 25 page essay.\n3. Since there is a total of two twenty dollar bills that Jenny can pay, she will receive the remainder of the money in change.\n4. Thus, we are calculating for the total cost that Jenny needs to pay for the printing of 7 copies.\n5. To do this, we multiply the cost for the first page by the total number of copies she needs to print (25 copies), which gives us 25 cents.\n6. The total fee Jenny needs to pay is: 25 cents * 7, which is 1.75 dollars.\n7.

The object, in this case, is the tail, since it is moving on its own due to the dog's motion.\n2. The process behind this movement is the tail wagging, as the dog would be moving its body in a certain way.\n3. Therefore, the sentence can be read as \"the dog, wagging it's tail, was running toward us from under the sofa\".\n4. The most common grammatical structure for this process would be \"running\", which is a verb used to indicate motion. Therefore, the answer will be an irregular verb, of the form \"was/were xyz-ing\".\n5. As the tail's motion itself is not a process but just an object, the process behind it must be the movement of the dog.\n6. The irregular verb \"was\" is a suitable choice, as it is a simple past form and conveys the necessary information in the context. \nSo the final answer will be \"The dog, wagging (its) tail was running toward us from (the) sofa\".\n\nInput: If the temperature is in degrees Celsius, then what is its opposite degree?

Further, we discover that Tommy wants to buy the cheapest flour option in order to optimize the amount of spending he does on flour.\n4. Lastly, we know that the cheapest bag of flour is heavier and more expensive than the other option.\n5. Solving the problem: If Tommy wants to use 4lb of flour to make 12 loaves:\n \n12lb = 4lb* 3\n\n10lb bag = 4* 1.7512lb\n\n12lb of cheapest available flour will cost him $10*1.75 = $17.5 and 10lb bag of flour will cost him 10 times 1.75 i.e. $17. To buy $17 of cheapest available flours, he will require a flour bag weighing more than 10lbs, which will cost him $13.\n \nTherefore, to get the cheapest possible option, Tommy needs to buy $17 of flour (weighing more than 4 lbs) to make his bread.\n \nConclusion:\nOption A: 26 lbs\nOption B: 17 lbs\n   \nOption C: 12 lbs\nOption D: 6 lbs\nOption E: 0 lbs\n\nSo the final answer here is B: 17lbs. \n\nInput:What would the man who has a toothache do if the teeth hurt and he wants it to stop?

Furthermore, since the customers are being charged gratuities without knowledge, the gratuities should not be included in the bills that the customers receive.\n4. The most probable situation where the shady restaurant charges gratuities is where customers are billed for gratuities without their knowledge.\n5. Since option D: \"the total bill, the sales tax, and the sales tax on the sales tax\" is impossible in this case, the answer is most likely option B: \"total bill\", because gratuities are simply added on top of the bill. \n6.

The overall cost of the cookware is $30\n5. Now for the set of 3 hand mitts at $14, we need to understand how to reduce the cost to get to the sale price.\n6.

Including the $3 in apron cost, the total will be $30 + ($10 * 0,75) = $31.75.\n9.

Reading books is an activity that someone who likes reading would do. \n2. Riding a bike, writing, eating, and reading books are all activities that someone who likes to read would do. These activities aren't exclusive\n3. Swimming is an activity different from activities related to reading books, like writing and eating. \n4. Therefore, swimming is an incorrect answer.\n5. Reading books is a general activity. To identify a specific activity, we need specific reference to what kind of books Linda reads.\n6.

{"idx": 405, "text": "1) The first step is to determine how many acres of grass can produce 3 bales of grass per day per horse.\n2) Let c=3 bales of hay per day per horse. To find this, first 3 bales of a day are divided by the number of hours in a day, which is 24 hours. So we have 3 bales per day = 3/ 24 = 0.125.\n3) Then we multiply this by the number of days in a month, which is 30. So 0.12 is multiplied by 30, giving us 3 bales of an average day.\n4) Once we have this number, we can move on to the second step to complete our solution.\n5) We assume that hay will last all through September and the beginning of October, which adds up to 33 days.\n6) We can then multiply the number of bales of hay per horse per day by this number of days to get 90 days worth of hay, or 0.3 days bales of hay.\n7) We then subtract this number of bales from the total number of bales that we started with at the beginning of the year. \n8) We subtract 560 bags of hay from 0.3 days worth of hay per horse to get 558 bags left. \n9) Finally, we divide this number by 9 horses to find that the farmer has 55 days worth of hay to last the remaining horses.\n10) If you were to answer this question on paper, step 5 might be a bit complicated, but you can write it out using multiplication as follows: 0.12 * 33 = 0.391612\nSo, if you're asked any questions where you need to use multiplication with decimals, just use the \"decimal point\" as a decimal point when writing down the equation.\n\nInput: A new bakery offers 2 new kinds of bread.

Then we can assume that for making popcorn only 5 mins were used. Then we can subtract another 5 mins for making the fries. So the time spent for eating is 10 hours and 5 mins. 2. The two movies' length is not considered in this problem, but we know that the second movie is 1 hour longer than the first movie. 3. And 1+10+20 = 31 minutes after the 10 minutes for making popcorn.\n4. So the time for watching is 31 minutes longer which is 1 hour and we add 23 minutes which is the length of the fries. And 1+53+23 = 87 minutes, which is now added to the 10+23 = 33 minutes = 1+33 = 34 mins.So\n1 + 34 mins is equal to 1 hour 34 mins as the first movie is 134 mins long so they are equal. 5.

For example, one problem is \"John has a phone that lasts for 3000 hours and he uses it 12 hours a day. How many days does he have to use it for it to last?\" 2) In order to solve this problem one first needs to understand the problem and then think of a mathematical procedure to solve it e.g addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. 3) The problem does not say how many days he used his phone nor does it say how many days in a week.\n4) After understanding the problem, we must first determine if the given information will help us make sense and the way we will use the amount of time to figure out the answer.  For example, in the previously given question how much time is the number of days? Do we just add or subtract the values?  From there, we must determine if the time we get is enough to figure out how long the phone lasted.\n\n5a) If the amount of time used for Basketball is the sum of the amount of time use for running and the amount of time used on the trumpet then the amount of time use on the trumpet= (10-(running+basketball)) or (10-39) or (10-29) 39+29=68 so the amount of time used in the trumpet is 68=0.7 hrs\n\n5b) We know that Kenny played basketball for 10 hours so we subtract the time used in running and the time used in the trumps so the amount of time Kenny played basketball was (10-2xrunning+xtrumpet) or (10-(2x39+x7)) or (10-(68+7)) or (169+16) or (170-12) or (158) or 58=1.15 hrs\n\n6) If we add the runs to the amount of time used to play basketball it equals 1.15+68=79 so the amount of time he played basketball +1.15+1hr = 2  hours + 79 hrs = 81 hours\n\nInput:If a tree falls in the forest and no one", "answer": " 40"}

We need to find the smallest possible quantity of rice that Rose should cook to get to the final amount of rice left. \n4. Therefore, going through the given options and considering the sum of 9 and 1/4 we can say that B and E can't be the final sum because there's no way to get to 10 kg of rice from those sums.\n5. Going through the remaining sums, we can clearly see that:\n   -Option A, adds 1 to both the 9 and 1 kg portions to get to 2 kg. This doesn't make sense though, because 2 kg won't get us to 10 kg.\n   -Option C, adds 2 to both the 9 kg and the 1/4 kg portions.

In an 'elementary' school, there is a primary level, a middle level (or grades 6-8), and a high school level (or grades n+1 to n+3). Therefore, there are three levels at elementary school.\n5. As there are four times more elementary students than middle school students, we can conclude that the number of students at the elementary level is: 1 / 4 = 0.25 students.\n6. Also, with four times more students at elementary school, there must be nine times more students at middle school.\n7. So the number of students at this level is: 50 (middle school) = 4 * 0.25 (elementary school).

There are 210 minutes total, and Camilla has enough dough to make 12 pizzato fill the oven. 4. Assuming the oven is filled in such a way there is enough space for one pizza to be cooking for each 30-minutes cycle of batching, then there are 3 cycles of 30 minutes in each 210 minute batch. \n5.

The question first specifies that each employee is allotted 10 days of sick days and 1\nvacation days over the course of a year. \n4. The given number of sick and vacation days makes the following deduction clear: \n   - 44 sick days and 19 vacay days over 1 year = 0.5/2 (since 1 days consumption is half of their\n   monthly allotment) or 27.5 sick and 9.5 vacation days per year \n5.

{"idx": 470, "text": "1) The question asks about the cost of buying champagne to fill a hot tub with a 40 gallon capacity. 2) It is obvious that the cost will depend on the number of bottles which need to be purchased. 3) However, the question does not mention a particular price for champagne, so this is not considered in the answer. 4) We start by identifying how much one gallon will cost. Assuming that the volume of champagne in a gallon will be 1, then we can write that 1 gallon = 1 quart = 1 quart / 4 gallons. In this context, 1 gallon = $12.50. 5) Assuming the discount applies to volume, then it is obvious that the price of a single gallon of champagne will reduce to the amount paid after discount. This can be expressed by multiplying the cost per gallon, that is, $12.5, by (1-$0.2) = 0.8. 6) The total cost of filling 1 gallon of the tub with champagne will be $10. 7) There are 40 gallons in the whole tub. So, multiplying the total cost of $30 (that is $10 x 40 gallons) for 40 gallons, we get 32 0.8-dollars and a resulting total cost of 32 * 0.8 dollars = 25.60. 8) The cost of 40 gallons will be 40 x 25.6 dollars = 1028.

So the total weight Andy lost was 568 pounds total, or 19.615 pounds each month. 9) Thus Andy lost 6.25 pounds of his 156 pound weight in the month he lost. 10) Repeating this for the following 2 months, he would gain back 8.6875 lbs. 11) Adding the weight gained back, his weight, then equals 53.204 in the given question. 12) Hence, the answer is 53.2 pounds, i.e., 54 lbs more than original weight\n\nInput: What is a word that rhymes with the word \"dew\" that isn't a synonym of the word \"water\"?

{"idx": 497, "text": "First, let's assume that there are always 5 matchstick houses in total. For this, we start using the numbers for houses below the line, 0 to 4. So the first group of matchsticks will be used for the first house, and after finishing the house, the matchsticks will be transferred to the group of houses below. The second group of 10 matchstick houses is on the right side, and after the 30th house is made, all the remaining matchsticks are transferred to the group below. The third group of 10 will also be made after the 40th house, and the remaining matchsticks will be put in the last group.\nNow, with only 10 remaining matchsticks, we will make 30 matchstick houses in the first group. So we have 30 houses in total. The only remaining houses we need to make are 10.\nThus, after the last house in the first group is made, we take the 10 matchstiks from the second and third group and put them into the fourth group.\nSo, in the fourth group, we have only 20 matchsticks, and we need 15 more. We start over with 0 houses, and we end with 15 houses.\nThis also applies to the second and third group. In the second group, there are only 10 matches sticks left, and we need 2 houses, then we start over and we put these matches sticks into the first group.\n\nThe fourth group consists of the rest of the matches sticks in 40 total houses.\nIn the fourth group, there are 10 matches stiks left, and we need to make 2 houses.\n\nNow let's count the total matches sticks and see how it matches our final answer.\nWe have 15 matches sticks remaining in the last fourt group. In this group, we made 15 houses, so we took 15 + 1 = 16 matches sticks.\n15 matches sticks were needed to make houses in the last group, and these 15 matches stiks matched the 15 matches stikcs remaining in the last group. This means that all these 15 matches remainings in the last group were needed to make the 15 houses. So we have 5", "answer": " 600"}

{"idx": 501, "text": "The answer is 37. We can solve this using the given data and the below technique - \n1. 23x-Derek number of balls (catches) =14x-Joe number of balls (catch)\n2. If the balls were caught in random order, then catch number would be distributed evenly among the three players \n3. (Joe number of balls)/(total number of balls) = Derek number of balls/total number of balls\n4. If this is multiplied with the total number of balls, it gives the formula for Joe's catches\n5. Total of Joe's balls/total number of catches=(Joe's number of balls) \n6. This is the same as Joe's catch number multiplied by total balls.\n7. Joe's catch number and the total number of balls can also be substituted for the above equation\n8. The above equation is applied to Derek and Tammy\n9. Derek catch number can be found through the following formula\n10. (Derek number of balls)/(24-23)/(Joe's catch)/total balls=24 \n11.  (Derek number of catches)/(24-4)=24 \n12. (Derek catches)/(23)-(20-4)=24\n13. This can be applied to the formula for Tammy, where Derek is substituted for Joe.\n14. This leaves Tammy's catch number as (16x-Derek number)/14\n15.

In order to make this time calculation more precise, we need to standardize John's training schedule so we can easily calculate how many weeks it will be to reach his goal.\n2. To determine how many days a week John trains, let's assume he trains 5 days a day and takes 1 week off.\n3. In order to get from wall push-ups (option B: 1 push-up) to floor push-ups (option E: 10-15 push-ups), he will be adding 10-11 reps every week.\n4. For John to be able to do 1 push-up, he needs to be able to do at least 9 push-ups without stopping.\n5. This means John is able to do minimum 9 push-ups in each training session.\n6. To determine the number of weeks it will take John, let's convert his goal to a weekly push-up number. \n7. Then we can simply subtract his current number of reps (or push-ups) from his goal number of reps (push-ups), this will provide us the number of weeks John will need to reach his goal. \n8.

The horseshoe magnet cost 3 times more than the stiker, so if the stikr cost $1, the horseshoe magnet would cost $3.\n5. The 2 stuffed animals are cheaper together, so if their combined price was 1 quarter of the horseshoe magnet, the individual prices of each stuffed animal is 1/4 of that of the magnet, or 1/3 of that of the magnet.\n6. In terms of prices, then the stiffed animal is 150% of the price of the horseshoe in dollar terms.\n7.

In that case, the 5% chance of regaining control should be multiplied by itself until it is reached 15.57 degree below 32 degree. Since it isn't given in which 3 degrees, we'll just take 3 as the increment. It is 15.5/3 which equals to 5.18. 2. In the second step, we need to subtract the result of step 1 from 100.

{"idx": 545, "text": "The question asks how many kilograms of food Elise had so far after buying more food.\n1. Since the question specifies that Elise already has a 15kg-bag of dog food, this is our starting point or a good guess. \n2. Based on this, our options can consist of the remaining amount of the first bag, the remaining amount of the second bag, and the cumulative total of both. \n3. We eliminate the option which is a remaining amount of a separate bag, since our original food already includes it, and we ignore 'none' as we do not know if that is the case. \n4. The question now specifies that we already have some original amount of dog food, as well as an extra amount from the next bag. \n5. After Elise buys the next 10kg bag of dog food, 40kg in total, we're left with 40kg of food. We can now discard those two options in between which include the rest of the first bag and the first and part of the second bag.\n6. The rest of what we have after buying 10kg is option '15kg-bag plus 10kg-bag'.This makes the most logical sense because we have 10kg in each bag after buying the second 10kg-pack in which case we already have 25kg in our inventory or what we have so far.\n7. The other options do not seem to make sense in the given context.\n8.

This is a question involving mathematics and is clearly referring to percentages, ratios, and the concept of useable car parks.\n3. If we assume that a parking lot measures 400 feet long by 500ft wide which totals 200,000 square feet, then 80% of this area, which would account for 160,000sq ft, can be used as parking for motor vehicles. For each car that is parked, 10sq ft is required, which means that 16,000 cars can be parked in total.\n4. Therefore, the answer would be 16,040 cars.\n5. Alternatively, assuming that you are using a large number of vehicles and a small percentage of it is parking space, this means that 80% of the total number of vehicles must be parked. This means that 21,825 vehicles can be parked.\n6. This means the answer would be between 16,025 and 21,850, therefore, the answer is 21,130 cars.\nSo the final conclusion is that, 10% of the total area that James' new parking lot is divided into useable parking spots for vehicles which results in an average of 21,834 cars.\n\nInput: A man and a woman saw the same number of stars in the sky, how did it happen?

There are 6 weeks in 2 months. How many weeks does it take him to complete all his work if he completes 4 weeks, 3 nights consecutively?\nOutput:1) In John's example, he works 5 days a week from Monday to Friday. So it is clear that Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday are his working days from 8AM to 10PM since that is how long he works each day. \n2) Now to answer this question, we must find out how many days work can be completed in a month. We know he works 5 days in a week, which is equal to 10 weeks. The answer is thus, 3 months.\n3) Now, John completes 4 weeks of work in 1 night. How many weeks' work can John complete in 3 months then? 3 * 4 = 12 weeks.\n4) Since John works for 5 days in a row, in 3 months he can complete 5 * 12 = 60 weeks of work. \n5) Now, John completing 4 weeks of work on each of the three nights means he completes 4 * 3 = 12 weeks of work in total for 3 months.

This can only be used for an absolute value, like a temperature. And, we need to find the ratio between the speeds.\n10) Option A: at least can be ruled out too.

If it was to be used, then it would mean at least 160 mph for a red car as the wording is 'at least'. However, in the statement, the red car is capable of traveling at 'twice' the speed of the green car. So, at least would mean at least 2. 6x the speed of the green.

Thus, option A 'deliver candy' should be excluded because the elves are not directly delivering the candy and they do not play a direct role in making Christmas a magical event.\n3. Similarly, option B 'collect money' should also be excluded since collecting money is not an activity that makes Christmas special for kids.\n4. Option C 'help children' is also wrong because what is suggested by the question is that the elves themselves take an active role in making the magic happen, not just helping kids.\n5.

The second hour is defined as the time period where 4 leaves fell. \n3.The third hour is defined as the remaining time period of the counting exercise to see the total number of falls. \nTherefore, we create the following table:\nFirst hour: Time period: 1 hour Number of leaves that fell: 7 Time period of counting: 60 minutes Second hour: Time period:2 hours Number of leaves that fell : 4 Time period of counting:120 minutes (60*2) Third hour:Time period: 1 hour (the remainder after the counting) Numberof leaves that fell: 0 Time period of counting:0\n\nBased on this, we calculate the average number of leaf that fell in the following way: \nAverage number of leaves that fell per hour =Sum of leaves in all the periods/ time elapsed in the time periods \n\nTherefore, the average number of leaves that fell in these three periods is: \n7+4+0/60+60*2+120 = 10.166667\n\nThe average that we need is the average of these three values which are 7, 4, and 0 or 7/3+4/3+0/3 which is 15/3.\n\nTherefore, we have:\nAverage number of objects per hour falls = Average number of objects that fell in the first hour + Average number of objects per hr that fell in the second hour + Average number objects per hr that fell the third hour\n\nTherefore, \n\nAverage number of leaf that fell per hour = 7+10.167/3+4.", "answer": " 5"}

The second question mark denotes that all the tomatoes before it are eaten by the birds. This implies that Haruto is not left with any tomatoes.\n4. The options here don't fit this criteria as they don't suggest a lack of tomatoes.\n5. Option A 'give half to friend' is not a natural answer as there are no such options provided in the question.\n6. Option B 'came back' can be ruled out as it would not be possible for the tomatoes to return to him even if they were eaten by the birds or birds were taken away.\n7. Option C 'have less tomatoes' can be rejected as it goes against the logic of the question.\n8. The first question mark makes the numbers following it exclusive to Haruto's backyard while the second question mark indicates that the numbers following it are no longer in his possession.\n9. The answer to this question therefore does not lie in this paragraph.\n10. The answer has to come from the second paragraph.\n11. All the numbers in the second paragraph have been shared out between two groups, Haruto and his friend.\n12. All the numbers in this part also have question marks after them just like they did in the first paragraph.\n13. The first figure that contains a question mark in this paragraph is the second part of Option D '29'. \n14. Haruto must be left with the 29 tomatoes, as per this part of the paragraph.\n15. Option B 'he picked' can be eliminated as the answer to this question is not whether he picked something he has to pick, but what he is left with at the end of the process.\n16. Option A 'half' can be ruled out since that doesn't make mathematical sense. Also, Haruto clearly gave his friend 78 which he got from his 127 and then must have some left out or he wouldn't have gotten to the 78.\n17", "answer": " 54"}

Choices:\n   - A: 20 years of experience\n   - B: a knife, a uniform\n   - C: patience\n   - D: a good attitude\n   - E: a degree in business\nOutput:1. In the restaurant business, a chef, one of the most valuable job opportunities within the restaurant industry, is what they call \"Head Chef of Kitchen\" in most contexts.\n2. To become a chef, one must have a degree in culinary arts, which is a field of study available in many universities.\n3. To get the degree, one needs patience, which can be acquired without having to be born with it.\n4. A degree cannot be acquired through having experience, which means that \"experience in the restaurant business\" cannot be a requirement. A degree does not indicate experience.\n5. A knife on its own cannot be considered a requirement to work in restaurants.\n6. However, uniforms, and a good attitude, are requirements of working in restaurants. A degree, however, does not necessarily equate to being able to learn cooking skills, let alone get a uniform from somewhere.\n7. Therefore, as we look at each of the options, only option D: a good attitude and a uniform can be considered requirements to work in the restaurant business.\n8. Therefore the final answer is D, and E, since the degree alone does not fulfill the requirements.\nSo the final answers are D and E\n\nInput: When people drink too much alcohol they often can't talk very clearly.

Lets start with a simple calculation.\n7) Lets keep the total number of cherries as total (T). We need to multiply it with number of time used for pit cherries per unit. That would be number of hour (H). That would be T x H.\nThis is equivalent to H/60, which is the number of minutes used to pit 20 units in one hour.\n8) That is we need to multiply the total number of cherry with 1/60 per hour and get the final answer.\n9) Total number of cherries = 3\n10) The required multiplication factor = 1/60\n11) Final Answer = T x 1/60 = 3 x 1/6\n12) The number of times Veronica needs to pit 20 unit to get to a total count of 3 would be 60.\n13) Which means she needs to multiate by 60 as many times as she would pits 1 cherry.\n14) The number of hours she took to pit in a unit would be 60 and the time taken to pit 20 in one unit would be 40.\n15) But the total time taken to pit 3 pounds would be 40 x 3.

Therefore we have to consider how many even slices were initially present in the pizza before cutting it in half, and how many slices were left as scraps. \n3. First, assume that all the slices from lard's pizza have an equal number of pepperonis on them, i.e. 120.\n4. Next, consider how many slices fell off when lard first picks up the slice. \n5. If the pizza had 40 whole slices, then there will be 40-1 = 39 slices left. \n6. Also, the half slices lard cut for jelly were initially cut in half.\n7. So, the slices left with jelly will now be 39/2 = 19.5 slices.\n8. If one of these halves fell off, then we can say that a whole (19.5) slices fell off.\n9. Finally, we have to figure out how many more slices there are left on the single slice.\n10. That will be 20 - (19.5). \n11. Therefore, there are 0.5 slices left on the slice.\n12.

Hence, the number of trash cans the town has actually paid for is 19, 14 cans for the roads and 2 cans added to the store. \n\nInput: If an ant can move down one square in x number of steps, what is the biggest number that can be written for x?\nOutput: 8 Choices:  A  one\nB  two hundred\nC  twenty\nD  nine hundred billion\nE  forty\n\n1. Given that we have an ant and the question is referring to its ability to move in \"x\" number of steps, we may assume that \"X\" can only be a number bigger than one because it cannot be \"zero\". \n2. When we take into account the options given, A\"1\" is already a number smaller than 8, so it can't be a correct answer.\n3. Option B \"Two hundred\" can't be the right answer because the total number of squares that an ant can move is greater than 200. \n4. Option C \"twenty thousand\" can't be correct either because ants can move on a total of approximately 2 million square units, so even if we consider the number of steps that can be moved in one second, it still can't be twenty-thousand in one second. \n5. Option D \"Nine hundred billion,\" can't be the highest figure because 900 billions are still smaller than the approximate 1.7 sextillion square units that an ant can move through.\n6. Therefore the only possible option that would make sense is option E \" forty \", because of it is the closest number that fits the requirement.\nSo the final is C: twenty\n\nInput: I can't go outside because a bear ate my umbrella.

Choices:  A. on a bus B. in the country C. in a park D. on a street E. on a bike\nOutput: The given questions are not asking about the physical location of the incidents but rather when they happen. 2. This means there are a number of incidents happening at the beach, in the parking lot, in the street, on the mountain and on the bus, at any given time of day. 3. The question, in its entirety, clearly states that \"there have been a number of... incidents\", hence there can't have been any in the town or city as it would be unlikely that there could be incidents on bus, which means the bus must be moving while the incident is happening.\n4. This narrows down our choices to E: On a bike, since bikes are usually moving, and the rest are static locations where incidents don't typically occur.\n5. Hence, the correct answer is E: on a bike.\nSo the final choice is E on a bike\n\nInput:\"Are they really going to fight you?\", the cop asked, \"I don't think you need to worry about that.\"\nWhat does this passage show about the cop?

{"idx": 629, "text": "1.) The first portion of the question contains a number, $45, and the unit, \"hours.\" \n2.) The next portion of the question contains an unknown expression, \"$75.\"  \n3.) In order to determine how long Alani would need to baby-sitting to make $75, we need to determine what that $75 represents in terms of the $45 that she already earned.\n4.) The question doesn't provide any details regarding Alani's previous baby-sitting experiences, so it's reasonable to assume that her rate is consistent and fixed.  \n5.) Alani probably can't charge a different rate at the same job where is currently makes $45. \n6.) The rate at which she currently works is therefore equal to one hour of baby-sitting; $45 = 1 hourly rate.\n7.) Since $75 = Alani's hourly rate, what would she need to do to reach this hourly rate?  \n8.) This could be phrased as, \"How many hours will Alani need to work in order to earn $72 more than she did currently?\"  \n9.) The answer is, \"how many hours will she need to work in order for her rate to change to $75?\" or $15, since $75 = $45 + $10.\n10.) Since $45 = 2 hours of baby-siting, she needs to do 1 more hour of baby-siting in order to make $75. \n11.) Her rate would then change to $45 + $5, or $50, since the rate Alani needs to meet in order to earn her additional $75 payment is $10 more than her current rate.\n12.) To put it another way, it would take Alani an additional hour (1 hour) of baby-sitting to meet the rate that she needs in order to make $30 more that she is currently making.  \n13.) Therefore, Alani would need to spend \"1 hour\" more, or another 2 total hours in order to make $45 plus $75.\n14.)

Let's say she puts in 2 hours of work to prepare the granola that we will be calculating for at a rate of $10/hr to compare it with her cost price.\n10.So her gross profit is $0.83/bag and her expenses are $2/hr, so the net profit is $0.12/bag.\n12.She makes $0.46/bag profit for each of the 15 bags she sold.\n13.But after marking the remaining 5 baskits down to $4, she only makes $0.14/bag profit for each remaining 5 baskets.\n14.Therefore, based on the assumption that Elizabeth puts in 2 hours to make the baskets: \n15.` Her net profit would be $0.13/bag and the answer is E: $0.13.\n```\n#!/usr/bin/env python\nimport numpy as", "answer": " 50"}

The steps involved in using this method are as follows:\nStep 1: Identify the equation needed to solve the problem.\nIn this problem, the equation is as follows:\n(40 - (50/2)) - (25/4) = remaining\nThis means that the amount of money Julia has left after making the purchase is equal to the difference between the amount she spent on the game and the amount she spent on in-game purchaces, divided by the amount she has left.\nStep 2: Simplify the equation.\nTo simplify the equation, we need to start by adding the numbers in the equation.\n40 - (5(10)) - (25(5)) = remaining\nThis means the amount of money Julia now has is equal to the difference of the original amount (40) minus the cost of the game (50), divided by the original amount left (40) minus 40.\nStep 3: Divide and simplify the equation.\nDivide the equation by 4\n(40 - 12.5) - (6.25 4) = remaining\nStep 4: Simplify the remaining equation.\nIn this step, we will divide the amount of remaining (37.5) by the original amount of money (40).

She also has an additional 5 avocados.\nThe problem asks, given this context, how many serving does Georgie have?\n1. Option A: \"she already has 5 avocados\" implies she already has 5 avoctados when she starts making the guacamole, if this were true then there is no need for the additional 4 avocados.\n2. Option B:  \"how many guacamole servings can she make?\" implies she is finished making the guacamoloe.\n3. Therefore, the only applicable option is Option D: \"7 servings\".\n4. Option D can be derived by combining the numbers in Option A and Option C: she has 5 + 4 = 9, and 3 + 2 = 5, therefore having 9 + 5 = 14 avocados left, divided by 3 avocados per serving, she has 4 + 1 = 5 servings of guacmole.\n5.

The thickness takes up some space and the wider pages mean you have to turn more pages. In the case of the same number of pages, the pages with size are longer.\n  2. They are the same. However, they are likely different sizes. There\u2019s a difference in the thickness of the paper. A book that is the same number of pages but thicker is shorter than one that is the same number but thinner, because you turn the same number of pages of the thicker book.\n  3. The smaller book is longer, because it is thinner and has fewer pages.\n  4. The smaller book has fewer pages; therefore it has space to be longer.

If he eats X bags of chips, he\u2019ll eat double of that.\nWe know that, in total, he ate 10 bags.\nWe are asked \" How many bags of bags of chips does he eat?\"\nThe answer is not a bag of a bag of chips! He ate a bag.\nTherefore, he ate 5 bags of chips.\nSo the final answers \nA = 5\n\n# What if you wake up at 8 or 8AM?\nOutput:  96  \nThe solution: \n\nFirst, let\u2019s find how many seconds in the day:\n\nThere are 3600 seconds in 24 hours, and 1440 minutes in 24 hours. So, a 24 hour day consists of 108000 seconds.\n10800 seconds in 1080 minutes, so 1080 seconds in 15 minutes, or 2 minutes and 20 seconds in 1 minute.\n\nLet\u2019s look at a minute:\n\nThere are exactly 60 seconds in a minute.\n\nA second is a second and 1000 times faster than a minute. It makes sense then that every 1000 seconds= 15 minutes.\n\nSo, 1 second in 1000 second or 0.1000 seconds\n\nTherefore, 1000= 1000000 in a year.\n\nOur question is the same. It is: 1000 * 7 1000 = 7000\n\nWhich is 7000= 700000 for a year.\n\nTherefore, in a year, it will be 7000 times that of 8. Thus, it would be 56000.\n\nTherefore 8 * 56001= 448000\n\nAnd then round to 448,400.\n\nSo, we need to ask how much is there", "answer": " 3"}

Therefore, we need to find the mileage covered by taking the difference between the miles John runs alone (4 mph) and the miles John runs with his dog (6 mph).\n4. Therefore, by simplifying we get 6miles - 4 = 2 miles covered.\n5. John will run 2 miles with his dog then he will run alone for another 30 minutes = 30 miles.\n6.

{"idx": 766, "text": "1) The question states that Brenda picks 205 peaches and then sorts through them.\n2) We know that 60% of the peaches Brenda picks are fresh. Using percent form, we can understand that 60% means: 4/10 or 40% of 100. Hence 40% of the 205 picked peaches are fresh.\n3) Further, it states that Brenda has to throw away 15 of the picked peaches as they are too small. Using logic, it is safe to understand that Brenda picked 205 picked fruits and had to throw away 10.5 picked peaches.\n4) We know that Brenda picked 10.5 peaches that she had to throw away. But, we also know that 40% of picked peaches are fresh peaches.\n5) Combining these two, we understand that 6.4 picked peaches are fresh and 3.6 peaches are discarded. Using fraction form, we can understand this as 64/100 and 36/100.\n6) So, in total, Brenda has 138.4 remaining picked peaches.\nSo the final answers are: Brenda has 105 and 33.4.\n\nInput:If someone is walking out of the library, how is the person leaving the library?\nOutput:The question asks how someone would leave the library. \n1. The word used has a strong association with walking, so we can safely deduce that the option which implies walking is the answer.\n2. Other actions like getting kicked out of the library and jumping out of the library are ruled out based on the context of the questions, leaving only one possibility: 'walk out / leave'.\n3. Option A, 'get kicked out' is not a suitable answer as this implies a negative interaction between someone and a member of the staff who may have asked them to leave.\n4. Option B, 'leave on foot' is not suitable either. This option does not clearly reflect that the person is walking out of the building but simply leaving. If they were leaving on foot, they may choose to walk or ride a bike, as walking is not the sole way for the person to leave.\n5. Therefore, the", "answer": " 135"}

{"idx": 770, "text": "First think of the range from which the french fries were to be cooked. It went from 5 seconds to 5 minutes. (Note that 0 seconds is not allowed, so that can be taken out of the range). This would give Bill some time frame around 5 minutes. So the correct time is \"2:52 minutes\". Now let's find out the solution for 2nd problem which is \"how much is remaining?\". Now the correct time is \"442 seconds\". We know french fries are meant to be cooked for 450 seconds but Bill cooked for 442 seconds. In a way, 442 seconds can be taken out from 450 seconds which remains with him as some time is remaining. The remaining time may end up being a fraction so we have to convert it into minutes by using this formula Time = (Fractions)/60. Time is a fraction. Multiply 442 by 60 and the answer will be 27,624. Now the next step is to find the fraction of that 27,644 value. 27,600 and 27,650 are 4 full units of time from the original time range. Find the fraction of the value and you will know the time in minutes. So the answer would be 65/1000 which means that there are 65 seconds remaining to go from 45 minutes into the time given in the question.  Or simply put to know the full remaining time, it is 5 minutes and 1 second, the same number that was given at the start. To put all that into the question, it would read, \"How many seconds have passed in the time the french fries take to cook for fully?\" or \"65 seconds have past in the total time it takes to cook french fries at first.\" \n\nInput: What time did Bill end up serving the french fries?

I have to find a number for the question that's less than 22 hours, because I don't want to give an answer that's too high and thus, distract a child from studying.\nThe question is asking how much daily time a child will get to watch television in 2 days. The given options are minutes, not full hours. Therefore, I have to multiply by 60 to convert them to hours.\n\nThe number of minutes is 45.\nWe have 60 options for converting them to hours.\nThe minimum of 50 options to convert will be zero.\nTherefore, option with 50 is not the minimum.\nThe minimum number is always more than zero.\nThus, the minimum time to convert to hours in the given answer is 1.\nWe have a total of 60 opportunities to convert every minute to hours, and 1 of those times must be greater than or equal to 4 hours to maintain our assumption.\nThus, all the other options are more than 21 hours to watch television every day, if we want at least one to be less than 22, and the minimum choice will be 1.\nThus, we'll remove options 5 and 6 since they are both 22 hours.\nIf a child is allowed to watch for four days a week, that is a total of 24 hours.\nThus, there will be 62 minutes every day to watch, and the answer will be closest to option 5.\nNow take option 5, which is 22 hours.

{"idx": 803, "text": "As we can see from the problem description here, the birdseed feeder can feed 14 birds, but Ivan is chasing away a squirrel and that squirrel is stealing half of the birdseed every week.\n\n1. Therefore, we can assume 14 less birds are getting the birdseed because the squirrel is eating it. \n2. And Ivan is still having to refill birdseed in his feeder every week. \n3. We can also assume that the squirrel eats the entire half cup of birdseed every week, so Ivan is refilling the birdseed in the feeder every 2 weeks.\n4. So the birdseed feeder is still feeding 14 birds per week, despite the squirrel's theft.\n5. And the squirrel is taking half a cup every week and there are two cups in the feeder, so the squirrel is steeling approximately 1 cup of birdseed.\n6.

Choices: A: a pet B: a pony C: a puppy D: a pendulum E: a piano\nOutput: The question implies that we are asking about young children (when you are a kid), so the answers should also be suited for them. Since the question is asking about some good things to see, options E: piano and C: puppy both don't meet this criteria and are therefore not the correct answer. Also, the word \"good\" in the question can be interpreted as a positive word, so we should probably look for things that would be good for children to see. The options left are A: a pet, B: a pony, and D: a pendelum. A pendelum is an interesting scientific experiment, but it is very unlikely that most kids could see one. A pet is quite expensive for a child to own, but most kids would love a pet.

This means that he sold 1/15= 0.066 of a bag (with a bag corresponding to 0.06 or 6.6 units ) or that he sold $0.10 of a bag. 3) Solve for: Profit= 0.10 x 1500 = 150 (each bag costs 15 dollars or 15/100 equals 0.15 dollars). 4) Since 100% * 0.06 = 6% and 10% *0.15 = 1.50 we get that he sold 6/10 bags or a total of 0.6 bags at 0.7 times the cost (0.7 bags in case every bag sold at a profit of 1.50 dollars). 5) 6 bags * 0.7 cost = 4.2 total profit. 6) To put it together: 0.15 x 0.10 + 0.06*0.7 = 150 + 4.2 = $154.2.\nSo the final  answer is profit= 0.15*15 = $2.25\n\nInput: A carpenter was hired to install a door on an apartment in a new building.

Therefore, the answer turns out to be C: 16.9\nSo the final answer turns out to be:C: 16.8\n\nInput:If you see a cat that isn\u2019t wearing a collar, what will you do? Choices:  [1]: Walk away. [2]: Put the cat in a basket. [3]: Put the cat in the ground. [4]: Hold your nose. [5]: Walk away very quickly.\nOutput:2. Seeing a cat not wearing a collar can mean two things.\nFirst is a pet not wearing a colar. In this case, the owner likely has one at home and it's a safe situation.\nSecond is an animal wearing a collar from a shelter that has been lost and is now stray. In this case, we should not hold noses but rather, contact the shelter to find out whether the cat belongs to them and find its owner.\n3. It makes no sense to put a cat in the ground when it's not wearing a colla.\n4. Holding your nose makes no sense unless the cat is in an urgent situation.\n5. Walking away quickly cannot be the answer since we do not know if the cat is lost or stolen.\n6. This leaves us with the only", "answer": " 7"}

The given options show us different time increments of minutes and hours. \n3. First, considering the number of miles that Bob ran, we multiply each mile by the number of miles he ran.\n   - Bob ran 6 miles which equals 6 miles.\n   - Multiplying (1 mile * Bob's running speed of 6 miles per hour), we can determine that he ran a total of 6 miles in an hour. \n   - He ran 6 miles in an hours worth of running, or 1 hour (1600 seconds).\n   - A single hour is 60 minutes, therefore Bob ran (6 miles / 60 minutes). \n   - We can substitute the 6 miles that we found in the hour with the 6 miles that he ran per hour.\n4. Since we know the pace of running by the time the first mile was finished, we can substitute their average running pace and we can do the same for their relative distance too.\n5. The relative distance that we are trying to find is the difference between the distance that Bob ran in the number of minutes that Jim has been following him.\n   - Based on the first answer obtained (6 miles / 1 hour), it can be replaced with 6 (which was derived by the equation above.\n   - We can insert those six into the equation below to replace (6 * 60/60),\n    (6 * 6) into (6 * 6).\n   - This yields 36.\n6.

Given the context, we know that he does some kind of work that is tiring and involves a lot of fatigue. \n3. The man might have done manual labor or other physical activities. \n4. The man's head is lowered because he is exhausted. Therefore, he is working hard to make himself look comfortable and hide his condition from people around him.\n5. The man is also annoyed.

We also must consider Dave, as we could see that he has more cats compared to Teddy. \n5. Teddy has 7 dogs. Ben has 9 dogs. Dave has 13 dogs. So, together, they have 39 dogs, that would mean both Ben and Dave have 6 dogs each.\n6. There are 5 less dogs than Dave. Since Dave has 6 less dogs, we can say he takes 6 dogs from Teddy's total number of dogs. As Teddy has 7, Dave now has a total of 1 dog.\n7. So, Dave only has 1 dog. As there are 6 dogs from Dave, Teddy has 1 less, then Teddy must have 6 dogs. \n8. Combining all of these together, we can see that Teddy has 6 dogs, Ben has 2 dogs, and Dave has 6 dogs.

So he has a total of eight ropes with him.\n3, The question is, \"How long is his rope after tying them all together\".\n4, We can use the formula for finding the total length of the single rope when all the ropes are knotted.\n5, The formula is Total length = Length of one rope (before knotting them together) X number of ropes.\n6, So, the formula can be written as Length = L1(1- 1.2/N) Where L1 is the length of a single rope, N is the number of ropes and 1.2 is the number of foot lost in a knot.\n7, In our case, L1 will be the length of the 8 ft length rope.\n8, The total length after tying the ropes together will be, L=8(1-1.2/3) = L.\n9, This means that the total length of the ropes after rope knotting will be 8ft - 1.2ft = 6.8ft.\n10, Therefore, his long rope after tying all the ropes together is, L = 8 - (1.2/3 ) = 6.8.\nSo the final rope length will be 8 - (1 / 3) ft = 6.8 ft\n\nInput: If you like to play the game of baseball, where would you need to bring or buy your own equipment?

For a simpler solution, we first know that the guests drank 90 soda cans and 150 plastic bottle, which is not enough to cover it.\n3. As the question is asking only 150 soda can, we can deduce that 100 juice bottles and 200 plastic bottles was not consumed.\n4. As we know that 120 soda was not consumed, the same number of plastic bottles should also not be consumed, which means only 30 soda cans were consumed, for these 30 soda was consumed we have 90 soda, which we know from the question.\n5. Thus, we can now say that the bottle used was 60, and we get 60 + 60.\n6. This means 120 juice plus 30 soda. From this, we know that 150 was not consumed 120 + 150.\n7.

{"idx": 925, "text": "1. It is evident that the solution lies in estimating the time required to complete the task of washing and drying all 8 loads of launder within a single set of cycles.\n2. The wash cycle takes around 45 mins for each load of laundry implying that 225 mins will be required to complete a full set of 8 loads. Hence, it will take 45 minutes \u22c5 8 = 220 minutes\n3. The dry cycle takes around 2 hours for each load of launder implying that 160 hours will be required to complete all eight loads. The total time required for washing and drying the eight loads of laundry is therefore 8 + 8 \u22c5 2 = 640 minutes.\n4. Given the time required for each cycle, the total time required for wash and dry cycles is equal to the wash cycle time * 8 + dry cycle time * 8 = 280 min ( 45 mins) + 160 min (2hrs) = 450 min (roughly 4 hours and 30 mins).\n5. So, the total time required to complete all the 8 cycles in the wash and dry cycles would be 450mins as wash cycle will take 220 mins and drying cycle will take 200mins.\nSo the final time for wash and dry cycle is 450 minutes.\n\n### Instruction:\nPlease use Pandas (Python's Dataframe and ML tools to answer the following questions.\n\n###Instruction:\n 1.

Choices: 1. A. 700 miles 2. B. 900 dollars 3. C. 800 dollars 4. D. 850 dollars 5. E. 800 miles\nOutput: This question asks about a comparison between the measurements of money and miles. So the first thing we need to do is convert the measurement to same kind before comparing both. \nSo 700 miles can be converted to how many dollars it is, using the conversion rate of a mile we can convert it to 411 dollars. \nSimilarly, we can convert 900 dollars to miles, and that conversion is approximately equal to miles, it is about 739 miles \nTherefore, the total number of miles spent in dollars is 411 + 739 = 1149 miles \n\nSimilarly, you can convert 850 dollars to miles, it results to a total of 1055 miles \nThus, the answer to this problem is we can spend less money by purchasing 10 miles less using 900 dollars.\n\nSo the final answer here is E. 80 miles less.\n\nInput: In the word \"comfortable\", is the the letter \"e\" in \"comfortable\" the vowel or the sound?

Choices: A: run marathons B: climb mountains C: walk D: ride bicycles E: do well academically\nOutput:  \"get ahead in life\" implies that you have to progress in your way to achieving your goals in life. \n2. Considering the choice A, running long distance like marathons may be a way to get ahead in life, but it's not specific to the goal progress for the question. \n3. Choice B, \"climb mountains\", requires a lot of physical and mental training, which is more focused on building skills rather than achieving certain goals. \n4. Choices C, D, and E all refer to physical exercise like marathon running, cyclic, walking, and doing well/excelling in academics. \n5. However, these have nothing to do with the question's context of getting ahead in life.\n6. So choice B or mountain-climbing is more suitable for answering the question.\n7. But \"mountain-climbing\" is too broad of an answer, so we need to further narrow it down to the specific type of mountain. \n8. The highest peaks can be found in the Himalayas; there are more than 15 peaks above 8,000 meters.\n9. The question mentions the person needs to \"get ahead\" in life, so we need to look for mountains that can help us", "answer": " 480"}

{"idx": 961, "text": "First we solve for Marcia's age in years.  Marcia was twice as young as Jan, which means her age was \u00bd Jan's age.  Then we subtract 2 from this value to calculate Marcia's age. \nSubtracting 2 from \u00bd Jan's to calculate Marcia' age leads to Marcia being 1.5 times Jan's age. Then we can substitute Jan's age for the value of 2 in Marcia's formula and solve again:\nMarcia was 2.5 times as young as Jan\nGreg was\n6 years.\nSo the final age of Greg is 8\n\nNote: This question is a bit tricky in that it contains four separate equations and they each need to be worked out carefully before we can calculate the answer. The easiest calculation to tackle is the one for the Marcia's age, as this requires adding a value of 2 to get a solution. Because the rest of the question is based on this calculation for Marcia's old age, everything depends on getting the correct solution for Marcia's. So, with that in mind, let's work through the Marcia calculation first.\n\n\n1. We need to work out how old Marcia is in years. We're told that she is twice as young as Jan was, and we need to solve this equation for Marcia and give her a number of years:\n\nMarcia is twice as young as  Jan. \n1. Marcia's age can not be negative 1.5 times years, for example -0.75  times years. \n2. Instead, we need to work out an equation of the form 1.5  times years.\n3. To represent this we need two of the variables in our equation. \n4. Let's say years is \ud835\udc65. \n5.

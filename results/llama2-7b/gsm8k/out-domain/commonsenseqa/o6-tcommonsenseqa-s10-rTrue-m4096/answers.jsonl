To determine how many yellow flowers there are, we need to know how many total flowers there are first: 6, to which 10% will be yellow, and how many total flowers are purple: 8, 80% of the purple will be orange.\n5. The first step is to figure out the total number of flowers - let's say it's 100.\n6. The percentage of yellow = 6/100 is 6%\n7. The percentage of purple = 60% (8 * 80% = 64; 100*64% = 64)\n8.

The subject (5 players) in the sentence is \"there are 5 players\". If the subject is \"there is 5 players\", it should be \"5 players' turn\". If the subject is 5 players, it should be 5 players.\n\nIn the original sentence, \"there is 5-players\", the subject is 5-play, and the predicate is \"a player takes their turn\", which is not correct. As we can see, there is no plural noun in the sentence before \"a player takes...\", so this sentence can only be correct if the subject is \"5-players\", and the predicate is \"their turn\" is correct", "answer": " 35"}

The question is asking what happens when someone turns on the lightbulb.\n\n2.) In order to determine if an option corresponds to the right answer, we need to consider the action of turning it on.\n\nOption A: Light shines. In the scenario of turning on a light, shining light is the direct result. It is therefore incorrect to answer 'Light shining'. \n\nOption B: Bulb is switched on, A light switch is not a switch, it operates the lightbulb. If the question was 'What happens when a light turns on?', then we could answer with 'bulb is switched on', however, we have the lightbulb already on, therefore this sentence doesn't accurately describe what happens, the light switch is pressed to operate it rather than switching it on. \n\nOption C: Light is switched on. This option refers to the turning on of the lightbulb (if you turn on the light it is switched on). \n\nOption D: Bulb fails. This option cannot be accurate because we want to answer about lightbulb-related activities (the action of turning on a lightbulb). The bulb failing would be an incidental response, not what happens as a result of turning on a light. \n\nOption E: On button is pressed.

{"idx": 68, "text": "Step-1: Here in the question we are provided with few conditions along with total miles or kilometers they have to run over 30 miles in total. These conditions are as follow.\nStep-2: The first three days Jesse runs (2/3)th of a mile, it means she runs 3/3 of a mile in total. For the fourth day she runs 10 mile then on the next two days she runs 4 miles.\nStep-3: On first two days Mia runs (3/4) of the mile, so she runs two mile on the first day 2(3/4) miles means 1 and half mile and on second day she runs 3/4th of mile then she also runs 3/4 of mile over remaining two days.\nStep-4: Now we can calculate the distance to be completed in remaining days. To do this we can add 3/4 of the distance she runs over the last 2 days with the distance she has already run. This equation will give us the final distance that needs to be completed over the remaining days.\n\nSo the equation we formed is: (3/4 x 1 and half + 2 miles)\nStep-5: After we formed the equation we can see that to complete the remaining distance Mia should run more than 1 and 1/4 mile per day.\nStep-6: Now the final question to be solved regarding the output is, on the final three days what is the average of their averages that they have to run.\nIn order to simplify the question, it will be helpful to know that the total miles or kilometers that Jesse and Mia have to run are 30 miles.\nStep-7: Now the solution will be their average over the last day would be 1 and 19/96th miles and they will have to run 9/96th more than this.

So we have a system of 3 linear equations with 2 variables; X, and 39 - Harry (let's call it 'y'). We can solve the system via the elimination method. The value for y is 18. Thus, we can write our system as x + y = -11. Solving this, the values for X and X - y = 49.

D: bicycles 5. E: cars\n Output: 1. Airplanes will have to be taken out of the choices because airplanes cannot travel faster than 400 MPH. Therefore, we have 4 possible choices left.\n2. Truck: Truck does not have speed cap, but tendency is to drive slow. It travels on land, but it travels faster if it is equipped with a turbocharger. Speed is not always a reliable metric in determining whether something is fast, and its use of roads also makes it less speedy than some other choices. In addition, trucks can handle weight very well. This makes it a good choice for an object with weight\n3. Helicopter: A helicopter can travel around 200 mph, making it a better choice than an airplane because of both its speed and safety. Helicopters travel on land, which allows us to rule out airplanes immediately. Unlike cars, trucks and bicycles where you have to focus on how you navigate terrain, a helicopter moves across this terrain without needing to worry about steering or maintaining balance.\n4. Bicycle: Bikes typically have a tendency to slow down for safety reasons, with some exceptions such as electric bicycles which can drive at faster speeds.\n5. Cars are a pretty obvious choice for fast as they are the ones we use to transport ourselves and things around. A car is equipped with everything you would need to commute, whether its speed or comfort, and even an optional turbochar", "answer": " 36"}

Let\u2019s call this total \u2018x\u2019.\n3. She started typing yesterday with 6 sentences per minute which is \u2018y\u2019. After doing calculations, we get x/y = 4.5. Which means Janice started the document with 450 sentences today. From this, it is easily understandable that she typed 1065 sentences.\nStep 4. Let\u2019s call it \u2018z\u2019. So z/1000 = x/1015. This means Janice can type about 497 sentences in one day.\nStep 5. Now if we assume 6 sentences per day, she can type 497/ 6 = 834 sentences in a day. So Janice can type 834 sentences if she type 6 sentences per minutes.\nStep 6. We also know that Janice was unable to keep typing 6 sentences per minute in her whole day.\nStep 7. So, she started with 450 and ended with 1015. So, she can complete 1015/ 705 = 10 sentences in 1 hour.\nStep 8. Let\u2019s consider hour in day as x. She completed 1x/y = 13.33 x/h.\nStep 9. So Janice took 13 x/h and was able to complete them in one hour. She will take 13 hours to complete 1x/y.\nStep 10. 1 x /8 = 125.\nSo, in 125 minutes, she can complete 497 sentence.

From that, we can determine how many clown fish are in the display tank. Finally, we calculate the number of clown fish that swam back to their own tank. \nFor this question, we need to know information about blowfish, as well as clownfish. To do so, let\u2019s see how many blow fish are in two separate tans by using the equation n+26=100 or n=100-26=74. So, there were 74 blowfish in total.\nNow let's subtract 26 from the number of blowfish in the aquarium (74) to determine how many blowfish are left in the aquarium: 74-26=48\n\nSo, there are 48 blowfish left in the main tank, giving us the following equation: 48+100=148. 48, combined with 100 for a total of 148 fish\nFor clown fish, let's first determine how many clowns were in their initial tank, then we can determine their numbers after the blowfish joined them in the main tank. The number of clown in their initial tank can be calculated as n=100=74, combined with their numbers with the blowfish so 100+48=148. In the main tank, 100+148=248 clowns, and after the blowfish move to the main tank, 248-100=15, so then 148-10=148-12=16 clown fish went back to their tank. \nSo, the final answer is 148-26=122. \n\nInput: At what location do people buy the majority of pet food?

We have a formula to determine how many objects she can juggle after 5 weeks of practicing. The formula states that the number of objects she can juggle for each subsequent week = 2(last week's total count of objects she can jugge)+1.\n3.) Jeanette's starting point is 3. Starting out with a total of 3 objects, her formula tells her that she can juggle 5 objects in her 5th week.\n4.) Her starting point is 5. Her formula tells that she can juggle a total of 9 objects in her 9th week.\n5.) Her starting point is not provided but we can figure it out using the formula. For her 4th week, we know that she can juggle (2(4)+1) numbers. \nThus, her fourth week can handle 9 objects and she can juggle 10 objects. For her 3rd week, the formula says she can juggle ( 2(3)+1), which is 10 objects.\n6.) At this point, we know that she has been practicing for 3 weeks. During week 3, she can juggle 3 objects. The week before (2nd week), she could handle 2 objects. The first week she handled 1 object.\n7.) She had a total of 1, 2 and 3 objects for her first three weeks of practicing.

After 3 weeks, she could juggle 3 objects which equals to 2(3) 10 +1.\n10.) To calculate the total number of objects she can handle for the number of weeks after 3 weeks, she multiplies 10 by the number of weeks after the third week.

This should not have been accepted.\n\n### Instruction:The above question is based on the idea of a \u2018divide and conquer\u2019 algorithm, where large problems are divided into smaller ones until an answer is found for the initial problem. In this case, the initial problem was to come up with an answer for 64. \n\nIn order to use divide an conquer, first a factor is chosen and each number in the range being evaluated is multiplied by the factor and added to the overall total.\n\nThis is done for each of the numbers in the range as shown in the pseudo-code below:\n\nFor each of the numbers less than the target number:\nFor each of the factors less than or equal to the target number, multiply that number by the factor and add  to the target number\nNow check if the total is greater than or equal to the previous total and print \"Divide and Conquer: %s\" if so\n\nThis algorithm does not check if the factor is greater than the target number. Without such a check, one can make the factor very large and divide the total for each of the values by a very large numbers, say 2329282328356329. \n\nYou can think of this process as repeatedly multiplying a number by this factor of 2329 and adding it to the overall total 1003456 as the target number. The problem is that 2329 is larger than 1003 which results in division by 2329 which gives a total of 4 because everything is mod 5. \n\nThe result? The algorithm gives as answer 4 for the question we had about dividing a target 64 into 4. It says exactly that, \"Divide and Conquest (64): 4\". This is one solution of these problems and another solution is to just get the answer", "answer": " 110"}

{"idx": 151, "text": "1: To first solve this problem, we have to work out how many times to multiply by. We are told Angela needs to deliver 8*X total items, where X is not already known.\n2. So Angela needs to deliver packages 8 times and meals 1 time, or 8+1=9.\n3. Hence, she needs to deliver a total of 8 packages + 1 meal, which works out to be 8+1=27 packages.\n4. We can now use our original information and answer the question. Angela needs to deliver a total number of items equal to 8*X = 27\n5. In order to find out how many packages she delivers, we must divide 27 with 8, which gives approximately 3.5, in fact 3.42.\n6. Therefore Angela delivers 3.42 packages per delivery.

So, you have to do the following steps:\n\n1. $13.5 = Price (Before Tax)\n2. $13.90 = Tax\n3. $14.85 = Price (After Tax)\n4. Total price = Price (Before Tax + Tax + After Tax) = $13.5 + $14.81 + $14.90 = $14.8+3.5= 18.3\n5. Therefore, Total Price is $18.3 only.\nSo the final number is $18.2", "answer": " 3"}

This means 30 is not the same as 2(3X). What is the number whose square is 30?\nOutput: Step 3: Given we know the answer is 10, our next step should be to go back to step 1 to eliminate options which wouldn\u2019t lead to 30. In step 1, options B and C were considered to be invalid because they wouldn\u2019t lead to the answer of 30. Let us know why in brief now. Given that 30 is not 2(3X), X can never be 5, and no other option could be 30 either. This means that, option B and C should be ruled out.\nNow, we just know that 30 is 10 times X. \nStep 4: We can eliminate all the choices which do not satisfy the requirement i.e., 30 is 3(X).\nAll options have one common characteristic i.e., they are all greater than 3. This is sufficient to be eliminated because, from step 3 above, we know the number X must be less than 3. As a consequence, choosing any options greater than 3 will not result in X, and will not satisfy the requirement that X<3.\nNow it\u2019s clear that option D 11 is the unique answer. So, the final answer is D 11\n\nInput: What does an electric heater and gas furnace have in common?

Start from left to right,\n2. The discount for every item is 10/10, so we multiply the number by 11/10 and obtain the discount.\n3. It's important to note that the cost of the 2 quiches in this example is $150 and not $15.0 that means that every quiche is $7.50 ($150/2), that's why their cost is $15.\n4. The discount works out as $11.50 on each quiche, while $22.00 on each croissant, and $4.40 on each biscuit.\nThis means that the total discount is $34.40 on all items.\n5.

{"idx": 176, "text": "A flat sand road represents an infinitely large road on a tabletop.  When the dune buggy speeds up, its speed is represented by a vector that points off of the right side of the table toward the edge and as it slows down, the vector points off of the left side of the table toward an edge and the buggy travels toward the center of the road.  The total number of miles the buggy travels on the flat sand road is a direct function of the horizontal distance the vector, r, points to the left (for slowing down) or to the right (for speeding up).  For example, if r points straight up, then there is no change in speed, whereas, if r points directly left (or right) there a 100% acceleration or deceleration in speed, i.e.  no horizontal movement.  The graph of the total distance traveled by the dune buggy is given by the equation d = -rt + l, where r = 12 represents the deceleration speed (+ or -) when the dune buggy moves over a downhill slope and d = 4 represents the speed maintained on flat sand.  So, d = l = 8 represents no change in speed.  Therefore, the total change in distance is given by the equation, \u0394D = l - \u0394l, where t represents time.  Also, let n = 1/3 stand for the portion of a trip taken on flat sand and let u = 2/3 stand for the uphill slope trip.  Therefore, the change in distance, \u0394D, is equal to the total of all the trips, i.e. n\u0394l + u\u0394l.  But, \u0394l is given by, l = 8 \u2013 rt = 8t.  Therefore, \u0394D = n(8) + u(8) = 24n + 16u.  Since the buggy only has one gear, u = 1/3 and, therefore, \u0394D = 24n.  But, by looking at the question and the data provided, it doesn't look like there are 24 consecutive trips.  It seems that we might have to break the trip into segments of two, three, or even four and to check to see if the change in distance falls along a straight line,", "answer": " 58"}

Averaging that, we get:\n(1200/3)=400 minutes total = (400min * 60mininanhr)=24,000 seconds\nWe can round to the nearest integer, which is 24,001. Since there are 60 minutes per hour, that gives us 400 minutes per hour:\n400miyh * 60miinah = 24,010 minutes\nWe can further round this number down to the nearest integer to get the result:\n(24,011) / (60) * (1) = 24,100 minutes (or 375)\nSince John volunteers for 2 times a month and 3 hours each time, we can solve for the total number of work hours per month: (20hours * 2 months) = 40 hours\nWe can then multiply the total number of volunteer hours per month by the number of months in a year to get our final answer of 10.\nSo the final number of volunteer hours is 10\n\nInput: A friend bought 34 cans of soft drinks for a party for 8 people.

Since 50% is greater than 20%, we can say that 50% of the total employees do not drive to work and take public transportation.So the total number of employees working for the company would be 200 (Base), Since 50% does not drive to work, we multiply the base with 0.5 to get 100, So 100 drive to work and 100 take public transportation, Now from the given 50% employees not driving take public transportation, remaining employees not taking public transportation would be (100 - 100)/2 = 50, So the given total number of employees driving to work minus the employees taking public transportation give us total number of employees driving the work, So the total number of employees driving would be 150, So Reaching to the final answer the employees driving is 150 more than the employees taking public transport.\nSo the final answer would be  150 more drives to work than are taking public transportation", "answer": " 40"}

{"idx": 245, "text": "Answers are in kilometers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnswer: The problem is a common mathematical word problem and is actually well-known as a \"Fermi problem\". A fermi problem can be any word problem that does not allow you to easily find the correct answer immediately. In this problem the answer is not obvious so a number of strategies can be deployed in order to successfully answer the problem.\n\nFirst, let's assume the fox runs at maximum speed for 30 minutes. So if the maximum speed is 50 km/h and the fox runs for 30 minutes we're talking about 60 minutes.\n\nHowever as suggested in the problem, we're assuming the fox runs for the entire 120 minutes. If this is the case, we have to subtract 60 from 120 minutes that leaves us with 60 minutes of travel.\n\nIf the fox runs at speed 50 km/hr for 60 minutes we get to 840 kms. This is a valid answer as a fox could cover this distance in 30 minutes using the assumption that it runs at maximum speed for the entire time.\n\nAnswer:\nA fox can run 50 km in 30 minutes.\n\nAssume the fox runs at constant speed for all 120 minutes,\n\nHence, it can travel 840 km every 2 hours.\n\nComment: Thank you for your effort to assist the OP with your post.

How many marbles does the boy give the last guest to make them even $100$?\nOutput:  Let $L$ be the remaining number of marbles.  There are $B+10=110$ marbles left.  If we have $180$ initially, when everyone leaves after the first $100$ then it's clear there should be $80$ left.  For the $100$ guests that have already seen him win, $L=80+80 =160$.  If one guest leaves then $L=150$.  If he has the last $160$ marbles, then $L=0$, so he has to give him a new amount, $20$, and now we have $80+160+20=340$.\nSo the last guest get $20$ marble for balance the party.\nSo the final answers is 20\n\nInput: Which of the following is correct,  A: Eating a hot fudge sundae will increase your waist size B: Eating a hot Fudge Sundae will increase calorie intake C: Eating a hot  Fudge", "answer": " 27"}

This means that Jill's basket has a space to hold 4*12=48 apples.\nStep 3 :If Jill's basket's space(48 spaces) is full, but Jack wants four spaces, this means Jack needs to add 4 apples(Jill's basket' space 48 minus Jack's basket space 12 is 36 spaces) to fill his basket.\nStep 4 :Therefore, 48 apples is 3 more than the number of apples needed to fill Jack's basket(12).

We get barry as 52, Larry 36, apple height-5f. 8. Here larry height (5feet) is already in integer and apples height (5) is already in feet so that is not converted into integers. 9. Now the sum of barry and larry height 42(larry=36, barry=6, applheight-5). 10. now if we are to convert the value into integer we divide it by 10(42/10=4.2, integer=4, but in this case because 5 is already in decimal we cannot convert into an decimal number). 11. 4 is greater than 0.5 so we can take 4 as a answer. 12. We can conclude that with help of barry he can stand on larry\u2019s shoulder and then reach the height of apples.\nSo the final awnswer is 4\n\nInput: What type of carrier is used for traveling to get clothes?

In this case, we can calculate the difference 1st: Yesterday = 18 - 9 = 9 = 9. \nThis gives us the amount that John earned today. \n3.) Therefore the difference from previous weekend should be 18 (18+20) - 9 = 30 = 30. \n4.) Now since 30 is double than 18, therefore John needs to earn the amount that is double than what he earned from previous weekend\u2019s Sunday 30).\n5.) For example, If we consider Sunday as the target day then total income John gained from three days Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday is 30. 9 + 20 + 18 = 57.\n6.)

Now the problem comes in with the remaining four books which we want to finish in month 2\n\n8. There are two ways we can approach it, if we read 4 books per month then it\u2019ll take a total of 3 more months and at the end, the total will now be 12 books\n\n9.

This is the reason why this is a problem for us because in month 2 we are reading 5 books and in month 3 we are supposed to read 4 books\n\n11. So if we read 5 books, our second month total is going to be more than our first month\n\n12.

Therefore, the proportion of total water use given to a particular farmer is proportional to the area he cultivates, with a specific weight assigned to specific crops.\n3. To find the total water use, we must first calculate each individual producer's total consumption:\n4. Bob's farming area is 3 acres of corn taking 21 gallons of water, 3 acres of cotton taking 80 gallons, and 12 of beans taking 24 gallons.\n5. Totalling all gallons given to a farmer, Bob needs 165 gallons, which is 37.5% of the total water allocated.\n6. When we consider Brenda, we find:\n7. She uses 6 acres of corn taking 12 gallons of water per acre for a total of 72 gallons.\n9. For cotton, she needs 7 acres taking 80 gallon per acre equalling 560 gallons.\n10. And her beans take 39 gallon per acre for 194 gallons in total.\n11. Thus, she uses 446 gallons, making her 69.2% of the total allocated.\n12. Brenda's is clearly the most significant water user. If we now consider Bernie, these are his water needs for his two crops:\n13. 2 acres of corn: 40 gallons of water per 2 acres which is 80 gallons for this crop.\n14. His beans are 24 gallon per acre totaling 49 gallons.\n15. Overall, he consumes 139 gallons of water which only makes for 24.8% of the total water required. \n16. So we can determine the allocation of each farmer's consumption in this design and the distribution of water among the crops:\n17. Farmer Bob's crop's totaling 369 gallons of water, account for 67.2% of the water used.\n18. Farmer Bern", "answer": " 36"}
{"idx": 306, "text": "Answer: 75.00 \n\nLet us set up the equation to solve;\n\nStep 1: We set the amount of money Tom has to the variable x.\nStep 2. To find how many more dollars Tom needs to save, we subtract the amount of money Tom already has from the amount of money needed to purchase the books.\nStep 3. The second amount of money needed to buy the books (150.00 dollars) has already been determined.\nStep 4. To solve for the unknown variable (x), we isolate the variable by performing a few steps to remove the fraction from the equation and combine like terms.\nStep 5. Simplifying the equation, we have:\nStep 6. Flipping the equation to subtract 175 from x allows us to solve for x:\nStep 7. The only time you subtract 175 is when you start with the total money Tom has (175) - the money needed to purchase books (150) = x.\n\nStep 8. We get y = x - 150 and need to find x.\nStep 9. By adding 150 to both sides of the equation, we arrive at: \nStep 10. The equation reduces to y = x, and then the variable x can be replaced with x + 150 which becomes 225.\nStep 11. Then, the variable x can be substituted with 225, the amount Tom needs to save up if he has 13 dollars. Then we get:\nStep 12. The final answer is 225. This is because when x is substituted with 13, then 13 + 150 = 163.\nThis amount of money is less than the amount Tom needs to purchase the books and Tom is unable to save the total amount required. \n\nThis is why the final answer is\n\n225 dollars - 163 dollars = 62 dollars.\n\nWhen you substitute x with 13 dollars, the answer is -62 dollars.", "answer": " 27"}

The bridge you're looking for has the words \"Bumby\" and \"bridge\" written on it.\n\nStep 2 - Determine distance to Bumby bridge.\n\nThe shortest route is from our main road to the bridge\n\nStep 3 - What is the shortest path to the bridge?\n\nChoosing a random path would be like guessing:\n\nLet's try A \"over the river\". This is approximately a 10-minute walk through the bush, as measured with the app on my phone. \nNext, let's choose B \"through the woods\", a 20-minute walk along the road to the bridge. If neither of those is correct, I could keep looking for other paths. \nStep 4 - Make your decision\nTo answer this type, you have to look at all the different paths, then decide which one is the best answer. If none of the other answers are the best answer, then the first and only answer to answer is the correct answer. \nAfter doing everything and looking, I can see that the shortest path to this bridge is A \"over the river\" which takes about 10 minutes.\nSo the final and only answer", "answer": " 35"}

And the fourth wall that is 32 feet wide and 2 feet tall would be multiplying the width of the wall by the height that that would be 64 multiplied by 1 and that would be 6 then it would double 6 and that would be 12.\n\nSo that would be multiplied by 2 more walls and she needs an additional 12 cans of paint. The answer 12 + 6 + 12 = 28. So, Lucille needs 4 walls to paint, and each can of paint for every 20 square foot area that that is what her total.

This means determining what operations and mathematical values should come first, second, and subsequent. We can see that we can solve this equation in as many ways as we want, thus this equation has an answer in an infinitive number of ways. Since we are not told the operations order, it would be incorrect to simply plug in the numbers and end with a correct answer.\n(1) One possible answer is that Sally, Jenny, and Moses paid $128, and all together picked 8,000 lbs of strawberries. This answer could be correct.\n(2 ) Another possibility is that Sally,Jenny, and Moses all paid $128 to be able to access the fields and they collectively picked 8,024 lbs of strawberry, or 824 more lbs than they could have picked if they had paid a standard, one time ( $4) entrance fee.\n(3) Another possibility is that S,J, and M, all paid $120. This amount is deducted from the price of strawberries paid to Miguel, leaving $8000 to be split between them. This means S got 3,750, J got 2,990, and M got 2,360. This is a possibility.\n(4) Another possibility is that they all paid $113 since their first choice (4) was to collectively pick 43, or 43 more than if S only got to pay $120, J only got to pay $767, and M paid only $1512. Therefore if they collected all the money paid, the number of pounds they picked would be 8,937.\n(5) It is also possible that S,J,and M all paid $112. This scenario would have an interesting outcome. With one exception, everyone is better off in this scenario. Sally, Jen and Moses together would have paid a total of $489.

Choices:  C: freezing D: room temp E: cold\nOutput: The ice cream is made up of liquids and solids (flavors, for instance) that are both frozen. While this is the definition of ice cream, however, what we're asking for is the temperature of the liquid part of the ice cream. \nTemperature of liquid:\n\n1. Water is usually at or near room temperature on Earth. Thus, for the ice cream to be cold and tasty to many people, the temperature should be lower than room temperature.\n2. Ice cream can be melted by raising the temperature above room temperature, but room temperature ice cream is usually hard or even sticky because it is frozen solid, so the ice cream should definitely be colder than room temperature.\n3. Therefore, to answer the question, if we're referring to the liquid part of ice cream, the correct answer is E: cold.\nSo this is the final answer.\n\nInput: The lady is sitting on the deck, where the umbrella is being sold.

The second part refers to the remaining part, that is third through fifteenth week respectively.\n4. The two parts represent a 2 part, 2-way table.\n5. That indicates we will need a multiplication to calculate.\n6. So in the second part, the rainfall is measured in inches.\n7. For the first 2 weeks, the rainfall was measured in inches.\n8. The third and fourth weeks, the rainfalls was also measured in inches.\n9. For the rest of the month, the rainfall (fifth week) was measured in inches. \n10. Therefore, the formula to calculate the rainfall after the third week, which is the rest of the month would be multiplication of the first weeks rainfall in inches, and the number of weeks.\n1. So the formula would be like: ((first week rainfall in inches) * (number of weeks))\n2. As the first week rainfall in in inches, we will convert that to inches.\n3. As the second part, the number of week is given to us, and it is not in inches, so we need to convert it to inches.\n4. The number of weeks in inches= (35,756/4)*(5)\n5. The formula now is (35,760/4)*(5005)\n6. So the total rainfall, as calculated above is 273,404 inch. As (first week rainfall)*(second week rainfall)=(35,769/432)*273404=196958. Therefore, the total rainfall for this month in November is 273403 inch.\nSo the final and accurate answer is 273503 inch\n\nInput:Which type of wood is the softest?\n\nOutput: Answer:  A: Aspen\n\nExplanation: Aspen wood is one of the softest types of wood.", "answer": " 180"}

Because if it you just start adding the numbers up, you would see that the first and second answer are more likely to be correct.  But the thing to understand here is this is a question which is asking about time-passed.  A is the option which states to get a degree in 4 years.  You should understand that for a degree, the schooling time and degree time can be different.  Suppose Tony studied for a Bachelor's degree, which took him 8 semesters to complete and after that, he took a 6 month break and was then admitted as a graduate student to study a master's degree to complete his time as a student, which took another 6 semesters for him to complete his degree.  This means 8 semesters in total.  But he started the time in 1995 and finished it in 1999, which means his time for his entire student life was 5 years.  If you go with 5 years as the time passed by, the most correct answer would be d.  Another option would be c too, because in the question, it clearly states 4 years for a first degree and 2 more years for the second degree and 2 years for a graduate degree.  Now each of these degrees can take varying time but as long as you put it altogether, 4 + 2 + 2, it would be 8 years and not 9 years.

Thus, the choices should have a location that can be used for playing games or a group of people engaging in a game.\n\nWhen we consider the given choices, we can eliminate four of the answers.\n\nA: Pool hall - This is not a playing location. It\u2019s more known as a place where one goes or can go to play pool. So it is not an answer suitable for the question.\nB: Airport - An airport has many people, but it\u2019s not necessarily a place where people play games. Mostly, it is used as an area to prepare for a flight. So, airport can also be eliminated in the first go.\nC: Theater - The theater is a place where people go to watch a play, musical, or other performance. This would not meet the criterion of a place where people play, as it is used to watch performances and games.\nD: Court - Courts are places where people go to participate in individual or team sporting events, but it is not something that can be used for multiple people to play a game.\n\nHence only Answer options E: School and D: Court remain now for our discussion.", "answer": " 8"}

This could mean in the ancient history or at the beginning of humanity.\n\n2) Given that the answer must be one of the choices listed and cannot be answered through reasoning alone, the simplest way to get started would be to eliminate any answers that do not meet the requirement of cooking over or next to a fire.\n\n3) As there appears to be an infinite number of other ways of cooking meat, without using a fire, it would be best and most efficient to first eliminate any that do not include a fire, as we won't need to consider these methods any further.\n\n4) A: Cook meat directly\nabove the flame.\nFire is a means of indirect heat, so a cooking method in which the meat is placed directly above a fire flame does not qualify.\n\n5) B: Cook\nover coal. Coal is typically used a fuel which produces heat on its own, without providing direct heat, in boilers or stoves.\n\n6) So, all other choices can be considered.\n7) C:  Put meat \nnext to the fire. In this option, the person is making the meat next to the fire, which is already there.

Subtract (10+6) from 3 we get 2 as answer, since we start from 1. If we divide the 3*2 which give us 5 and subtract 5 we get 2. So the group of spiders should have 2 more legs than that it has from one spider.

{"idx": 499, "text": "Answer: There are two ways to approach this problem:\nMethod 1: We know that each person has five bags at 50 pounds each. Therefore, 250 pounds total for each person. Since we're looking for the number of bags each passenger is allowed, we can use these weights to calculate the total weight limit for each passenger.\n50 * 5 = 250. Since each passenger is subject to a 250-pound limit, each person can carry two more bags (50 pounds each). This method would be helpful in situations where the luggage weights are known and you are trying to determine the passenger capacity. In other words, this would be helpful in a situation where you already know what each person is carrying and are looking for a certain total limit.\nMethod 2: A better approach in this scenario is to add up the luggage weights and work from there.\nThe total luggage weight is the sum of 1750 pounds (six passengers luggage x 50lb limit).\nIf we want to carry the maximum possible amount of luggage (the most weight allowed by the plane), we have to subtract the total luggage weight from the maximum weight the plane can hold, which is 6,000 pounds.\n6,000 is the maximum weight the plane CAN hold. - 1,750 is the least weight the plane CAN carry (the total weight of luggage carried by the six passengers). This means that 4,250 pounds of luggage can be added to the plane to have it weigh 6,00 pound which is maximum.\nSo the total luggage of the six passengers can be increased by 4500 pounds to make it total 4950 pounds\nSo the final answer for airplane in this question is 12", "answer": " 90"}

The floor push-ups per week is calculated by adding 15 (number of wall push-ups x 5) to the floor push-ups per day that he will have done, or 15 + 15 + 3 + 15 +15=66.\n2.  So floor push-ups per weeks is (66 x 7 days a week)=452.\n3.  Then, high elevation push-upe per week is floor push up per week x (15 / 66).\n4.  The answer thus is 7 weeks.\n5.  To get to floor push-upe, then we take 452 and divide by 7 and then multiply that number (63.714286) by the number of days in a week to get 637.14286.\n6.  To get from high elevation to floor elevation, we just add 15 times 7: 105.\n7.  Then (637.1 - 105) gives us 532.1.\n8.  But we want 1,618 which is 326 x 5.\n9.

But we want it to be expressed as percent.\n  In order for you to answer the question, you need to first find out how likely it is that the worst case scenario will come into play. We know that there's a 5% chance of skidding, and we know the probability of skidding is proportional to the temperature, given the information that for every 3 degrees the temp goes down, the chances of skidded increase by 5%.\n\n  We can set up some equations by putting this information through the Binomial Distribution.\n  For every 3 degrees, this is a sample space. In order for this sample space to be possible, that 3 degrees has to be a multiple of 2.\n  So we know it's possible when the temperature drops by multiples of 2, the chance of skidding increases by 5% because the chance of it happening by multiples of 3 is 0. So this sample space only happens when it drops by multiples 2.\n\n  Now we create another sample space we multiply this sample space with x. Because we are multiplying, it has to be x>1.\n  Then we will have this probability distribution.\n  We can find the C.D.F and see the relationship between the temperature and the chance of skidded or not. So C.D.F increases as temperature decrease.\n  This is a perfect binomial distribution. It follows the standard formulas.\n\n  Then if you are interested in the proportion that it's below 0.3.\n  So the binomial distribution is not normal like NORMAL, so this NORMAL(1.5,0.3) is a distribution.\n  NORMAL is a distribution because it has the mean. But Binomial distribution does not have the mean.\n  So we use this formula instead to find the C.D,F and then to get the required probability.\n  To get the normal distribution of a distribution.\n  As we see, the mean is 0.3.

Therefore, we can assume there were initially 336 books(not 358). \n7. Now comes the calculation part. 1. We don't need to actually count how many books are there in the library. We need to figure out how many are left to determine how many books are there now in the library. 2. We can assume that on Monday and Tuesdays, each book was taken out or brought back in the library when 124+22=146 are taken out or brought back per day or a total of 8,728 hours. \n3. So, how many books are now in the library = 336 - (8,728 x 1.5) = 241.44. \n4. So 241 books are left in the library on Wednesday and hence we can assume that we have 241 books left in the library.

Therefore the cost of a one time ride for 10 people in an entire month will be $20. \n7) The minimum number of rides that the person should take in a single month to make the cost cheaper than buying a one-time ticket is found to be 6 days' worth of rides. It's because 30-days = 90 rides, so taking 60 rides to buy a 30-days worth of rides will be $30 and taking 6 days' worth rides for 6 days will only be $12, and thus buying the 6 days instead of 90 days is cheaper overall. \n8) Therefore there will be 20 days during the month when no rides are taken, so the person can save 20 days of $2 by not calling for a rides. \n9) Therefore the passenger's minimum number days taking ride will be 11(the total number of days in the month divided by 0.9 (the fraction of days they don't take any ride on)).\nSo the final answer would be C.", "answer": " 26"}

Which means 1 sq ft of paved parking lot will be equal to two ft paved parking lot. Step 2. Apply the relationship 100 sq feet = 10 sq ft and get the relationship 4 feets =18 feet and 50 ft =30 feet. So 80 ft =82 feet and 5 feet= 100 feet and 2 feet = 100 feet. Step 3. Multiply the relationship 80 feet = 82feet by x to get the number of cars as 91 cars. But the question says that out of 80% only 80% that is (out of 100=40%)=40% that is=40% and (out of40%)=16% which is =96 cars. So total cars in the parking lot =91 cars.

So, we will be left with 2 options, so we will have to exclude 1 more from those 2 options.\n\n2. We can eliminate 2, because eating is a way of consumption, and consumption is not what we could find in the fridge as a whole. We can \"eat all the things in the fridge\", but not \"eat all the \"fridge\"\".\n\n3. That keeps us just with 4 options, but if we can \"eat all food\", we could \"eat all food in the fridge\", so 3 and 4 should be eliminated.\n\n4. So, we are left just with the choice #5\n\nSo the final answer, the only option we could choose from, is #5.\n\n\n# What should he do if his name is Robert?\n\nInput: What should the name caller do when speaking to the president?

This can be broken down into two parts:\n\nThe number of cards they need to make so that every student makes 8 cards.\nThe number of cards each student makes\n\nConsidering Option 1: The number of cards they need  to make so that every  student makes 8 cards\nWe know that there are 30 k(children)\nWe also know that the number of  cards = 1000\nThis means that every student must make 8 cards\nThis means we need to find the #of cards to make so that every person makes 8 cards\nNow, using an assumption that every student makes the same # cards, we can express it as # of cards = (30)(8) =  240\n\nIf we were to have more than 30 students but made the same # of cards, the last student would have to make  1 card\n\nThe same concept can be expressed in terms of # of cards remaining.\n(30) (8) = # of cards needed\n(29) (8) = cards remaining\n(28) (8) =  # of cards left\n...\n...\n(2) (8) = Last card \n(1) (8) = last student \n\n\nWe need to compare  # of cards needed (30) (8 ) with # of cards left (1) (8).\nThe rest of the math is similar to addition. We would need to determine the number to add to the left to make the number right.\n\nTherefore # of cards remaining = # of  cards needed - # of cards left\n\nThus the number of cards remaining =  (30)(8)-1 = 29   (30)(8)(9) -  (30)(1) = 29  29 = 30 X 8 - 30      30 = 9\n\nConsidering option 2 : the number of cards each student must make\n\nWe know that there is 30 k(kids)   in the class, and hence we know that each kid gets 1 card\n\nThus the total number of cards made by 30 kids =  (30)  1 (", "answer": " 760"}

Choices: 1= Cousin Fred 2= Dad 3= Big Fisherman 4= Fisherman 5= Big Bass\nOutput: 1: Dad - This makes more sense because a fisherman would probably not come with a bigger bag of bait while fishing with his family or friends. Also, not many fisherman's could afford to bring a good bag of bait each and every time they would go on a fishing trip. \n2: Big Fisherman - If someone with a big bag of bait would come to a fishing camp then he would have to pay the camp fees. \n3: Big Bass - This wouldn't make sense if a person had a bigger bag of bate. Also, big bass couldn't afford to bring a big bag every time they went fishing. \n4: Fisherman - Fishermen would probably have a smaller bag of bait and would have to often stop for more, unlike someone who had a big bag and no plans on buying any more.  \n5: Fred - This choice would be the best pick because people would only bring a bigger bag of bite to certain fishing trips. \n\n## Aptitude Tests \n### 1.

A bus is a vehicle and so does an India travel on the Indian roads. But what if it does not travel on Indian roads? Then it would not be an India (if it does not travel on the Indian roads) right?\n\nSimilarly, if 10 cities of the world are traveling on one road (e.g) highway of 10 nations where does city-A from city list, travel on?

If they are traveling on the other end of the highway then that means they are Indian or not?\n\nHence, the question does give a valid answer.\n\nThe answer is: A) so we have all those countries and the entire world know that India is capable of handling a large capacity city bus.\n\nSo the Final answer is A: so we have all those nations and the entire world know India is able to handle a large capacity city bus\n\nInput: Which of the following is NOT a property of a physical system?\n\nChoices: \n- Internal entropy.\n- Internal states can change.\n- The system is a continuous open system.\nOutput: Here is a tricky question.\n\nFirstly, Internal entropy is a property of a physical sytem.\n\nA physical system has been defined by physicists as any system consisting of particles in a set volume and indefinitely divisible space.\n\nWe can further classify the following types of physical systems as classified below:\n - Mechanical systems\n - Thermal systems\n - Electrical systems\n - Em", "answer": " 40"}
{"idx": 590, "text": "Solution: \nStep 1. This problem requires us to calculate the number of square tables we would need along with the number of pupils who could fit at one table.\nStep 2. Let's start by determining the total number of tables available. There are 7 rectangular tables so there are 7 rows of 4 columns which gives us a total number of 28 columns. Hence, there are a total of 28 tables.\nStep 3. Now, let's determine the maximum number of people a single table can accommodate. If the rectangular table can seat 10 people then the square table can accommodate 4. Hence, a square table can accommodate a maximum number of 4. Hence, it can be said that a square table can seat 4 people.\nStep 4. Therefore, the maximum number of square tables that can be used in each row is 4 - which means that each row will be made up of 4 square tables. Since this formula is applied to every row it means that there will be total number of 4 x 7 - which comes out to be 28 square tables.\nStep 5. Lastly, the maximum number of pupils that can fill all the 28 tables of 28 tables is 7 x 28 = 196 pupils can seat (28 * 7 = 196). Therefore, by placing 28 tables of either square or rectangular tables the maximum number of pupil that can read is 90 (83 from rectangular and 7 from square = 80 + 7 = 90 = 90 pupils).\nSo the final answer will be 28\n\nInput: In a park, in the shade of a tree there are six children A, B, C, D, E and F.

Step 3: Next, we need to figure out how much is A, B, C cost together in total. For example, in case if A = 15, then we can say her total expense is $80 + A = $95. Step 4:  Now we can say Angie is left with $95 - $38 = $57. Let's suppose her total income is I = $80. So the remaining money after she pays her household taxes each month is $80 - $57 = $23. Step 5: Let's say her income I = $80 and expense E = $95. Now total expense + household taxes = $80 + $57. That will give us $137.

She used 12 minutes to answer the 16 questions she has done. She used 30 minutes to answer 16/80 (2/5th) of the questions.\nTherefore, we can say that Jessica is taking 3 1/2 minutes per question.\n\nTherefore, in the remaining 37 1/2 minutes Jessica would need to use: 1/3 of 37 1\n\nTherefore, Jessica would need to answer the next 29 questions in 13 min. + 1/6 of the extra remaining time is 13 + 1/6 = 13 1/6 min. Or, 13.0666 minutes in total.\nTherefore, Jess would need to complete question 81 in 13.07 minutes.

{"idx": 628, "text": "Let 'C' be the cost of a table, and let 'M' be the cost of 4 chairs. \n1. Then, 1/C = 1/7. The 1/7 on the left is not actually C. \n2. This means the ratio of 1 chair to 7 chair is one-seventh, or: C/7 = $140. \n3. Or, $C = $140 * 7, which simplifies to C = $140*7 = $980. \n4. For a complete set of 4 chairs, the cost will be 4 times as much as the cost of a chair. So, M = $980*4.\nSo by doing the multiplication we get 4 chairs are 8 times as much as a chair, M = 8 C\nSo M = $98*8 = M = $784\nHence the final answer is M = $786\n\n\n Input: A clock shows 3, when 50 minute passes, a clock shows 35.

To calculate the total number of dogs with pointy ears, we would need to subtract the total number of dogs without pointy ears and that's when 15 was pointed out and from there on we can subtract it from total no of dogs so, what's the final answer?\n2. The number of dogs without point ears is not mentioned, only the number of dogs with point ears is given.\n3. We can assume that there is no dog with only spots and no points or pointy ears. But spots might have only half of the dogs, so to count dogs with spots and dogs without spots, we need to subtract the numbers.\n4. Madison's dog wouldn't contribute to the total since it was mentioned that she took her dog to the park so, we can ignore that.\n5. The total number of spotted dogs is given 15 and the total number of penned dogs is given as half without indicating the number of spotted dogs.\n6. Therefore, if we subtract the number of spotted dog (i.e half of the total) to the total no of dogs with spots and we\u2019ll get remaining no of dogs (i.e without spots).\n7. 1/5 is equivalent to 20%. We can say that there are 20% of non spotted dogs in the park. That means that 80% of the dogs have spots.\n8. Now since dogs having spots contribute to 80% of total dogs and dogs without spots contribute to 20% then it would mean that there around 80% of 15 is 105(as 15/80 x 20%).\n9.

In that scenario, each audiobook takes half an hour to listen to and she listens to six hours each day. The total number of days taken to complete all six audiobooks therefore becomes 30. \n7) Second, let's look into the scenario where she takes 30 hours to complete each audiobook. Then she will take 7 days to complete each audiobook and listen to them for 7 hours each day to complete all six audiobook. This means that in all, she spends 49 days listening to her six audiobooks on her audible app. \n8) Third, let's look over the scenario where she completed first four audiobooks in six days and listened to two of them for six hours each day while she listened to the other two days for four hours each day. Hence, she completed the four audiobooks in 6 + 4 = 10 days and the fifth one in 6 + 3 = 9 days to complete all six audio books in 19 days. \n9) Last, let's look where each audiobook took her 4 hours to complete.

The question is asking to multiply two quantities together: one is the page amount divided by the hourly reading pace, and the other is the 250 page amount divided by the 20 page per hour reading pace. 3. We can use multiplication to solve for the amount of pages in the 250-pager that Grace can read over the same 20-hour amount of time that it took her to read the 200-pager.

{"idx": 706, "text": "Input:What are people with blue eyes most likely to look like? Choices: A: bald B: brown colored eyes C: tanned skin D: green colored eyes E: yellow colored eyes\nOutput: The answer is C. Blue eyes are a dominant gene, but genetic eye color isn\u2019t passed down the way you may think. In most cases, both parents carry the gene for darker hues in the skin, known as a \u201cwarm\u201d gene. They\u2019re both a contributing factor, but parents may pass on genes that can cause their child to have blue, green, hazel or brown eyes. As blue is a dominant trait, if one parent carries the blue gene and the other carries the brown gene, then chances are the baby\u2019s eyes will be blue. However, it isn\u2019t that simple. Sometimes, brown eyes are dominant over blue eyes. When two brown-eyed parents are in a heterozygous relationship, it is likely the offspring will develop brown eyes. This means that the child is half likely to have brown eyes and half likely to have blue eyes. This can result in varying degrees of blue hue. That being said, not all blue people, regardless if they are mixed race or not, are blonde haired and blue eyed. Some may have blonde hair but light brown eyes or darker skin. Many, like most of the children in the photos below, are mixed! \nSo the final answer to this question is C.\n\nInput: How does a plant get nourishment for its food? Choices: A. through the roots.

If Alice sold twice as many, and Emily sold 90 or in total 180, then Alice might sell 180*2 / 1.5 = 90, then Emily can sell only 90 - 90 / 180 = 45 oranges.\n\nHence Alice sold 90+ 45 = 135 oranges.\nNow if Emily sold 9 -5 = 42 oranges.

Calculating the total amount of money in the bill ($50 dollars)\n3. Calculating the total change ($9 - $50 = $-41)\n\nSince Jimmy bought three pens for $1 each, he would pay $3, given the cost of $1 each for three pens. Using the total price paid formula, the total price of pens is 1 x $3 = $3. Hence, the total cost of the pens is $3. Similarly, since 4 notebook prices are $3 each but he bought 4, he must have paid $12. The total cost of the notebooks is $12, given their cost of $3 each for four notebooks. Finally, he bought 2 folders for $6 each, which makes the total cost of folders $12.\n\nTherefore, the total cost of Jimmy's purchases from the store comes to $1 x 3+ $3 x 4+ $3 x 2 = $12+ $12+ $6 = 24 + 24 + 12 = $60.\n\nNow, we will move to the next part of the problem, which involves calculating the total value of the $50 bill.

It is more eco-friendly to store food in the freezer than in the fridge because it needs to be kept running.\nOutput: The question is asking the reason the man put food in the freezer. \nStep1: We can cross out all the options because the man putting food in the freezer has not been mentioned anywhere in the question. In the question, it asks why the man would put food in the freezers, not just about the man. Therefore, we can cross out options 1, 3, and 5. \nStep 2: Option 2 cannot be the answer because in the question, it states that the main character puts the food in the freezER after cooking rather than in the frIDGE, which means we can cross out option 2 also.\nTherefore, as per the given data, there is only 1 correct answer to the question.

The murder option would apply when birds are hunted on purpose or intentionally.\n3. When a group of bird are on a family vacation? This does not align with the wording.\n4.

The birds going to a vacation can be seen as a group going on a family vacation but this again does not align with the question.\n6. Now, according to the dictionary, the wording of the murder option is when the birds become irritated or angry. This could be said to be when a group of birds becomes angry or irritated. It does not have to mean when all birds become angry or irritated at the same time but when they collectively become angry or irritable at the same time.\n7.

And $1/potato, in order to keep the cost at $300, at least 192 potatoes and the salt she needs to buy = (192 potatoes x 4)/2 = 96 potatoes.\nSo the final step is just to go to the market and just buy the necessary amount of 96 potatoes, which cost $9.6, and the necessary amount of salt, which is 200 grams.\nSo, Susan would have to buy (96 potatoes x 100g) + (200g salt x $2) = 300.3\nSo the final answer will be 300.", "answer": " 12"}

One, a bounce house doesn't have to be started after a fall, this question isn't even about falls, it's about bounce houses. Secondly, landing with force isn't the only thing that could create force, and thirdly, landing is more of an outcome of the start. \n2: This is not correct. If you were going to move a bounce house quickly, you wouldn't start by walking like crazy. It would be easier to quickly jump into it or even go a little bit forward and push it.\n4: This choice is wrong. \"Getting the jump\" can be taken as jumping into something, so it is incorrect \n3: It can be easy to say this answer because it describes how you jump into something and then land like you had a force behind your jump. So if you landed with force, then you were going to jump into something, but for the bounce house, you can't just jump into them, you'd probably have to go a little bit forward on it and jump.

{"idx": 787, "text": "The question provides the information needed to solve for the correct answer.\n1. John writes 3 stories every 7 days.Each short story is 5 pages, each week.\n2. He also writes a novel each of 500 pages 12 weeks a year.\n3. Each page contains 2 written words.\n4. Each sheet of paper can contain 10 written words.\n5. To write a novel by a week, a person needs 600 paper sheets.\n6. We can simply multiply two numbers to get the final volume of paper sheets.\n7. Since, there are 12 weeks in a year and each week needs 600 sheets, the total number of sheets needed to complete a novel per year is 7200.\n8. To find the number of sheets required per week, the total is divided by the number of weeks in a year, that is: _________________\n9. So, the overall number of sheets required is, 2 years multiplied by 7200, divided by 52.\n10. This is the final answer, a ream contains 600 sheets and the person requires 2 Reams (and 1/5th of an extra ream) in total for writing novels every year with the above set of parameters.\nSo the final equation to get the answer is 2\\( \\times \\)7200\\( \\times \\)52(years + 1/5 \\times year\\))\n\nReams required = 2\\( \\frac { 7200 }{ 75 } \\) = 28\\( \\frac {3 }{10 } \\) Reams, Reams required + 1/5 = 3\\) \\(\\times \\) Reams\n\nInput: How much money in a single cashier\u2019s check?

Choices: \n A: blue B: green\n C: green D: red E: gray\nOutput: 1, The first question asks us to differentiate between different job scenarios while considering colors. Since 'color' options are listed, we can safely eliminate 'blue, green, red, and gray' as there are only 4 colors in total.\n2. Next, 'blues' and'reds' are opposites, the first implies cooler and the second is warmer. This eliminates 'blues' so we are left with only green and gray.\n3. 'Green' can be associated with the color of grass, which can suggest a job working outdoors, so it appears to be a more suitable one to choose from. 'Gray' represents cloudy or rainy weather. So, the right answer is 'Green'.\nSo the final answer should be C: Green\n\nInput: What do you do with the toothbrush?

You have to be able to get into \"math mode\" quickly, and for some students this may come with the feeling of pressure.\n\n## The first thing to think about when solving questions like this (a question where you would end up with an equation that is very big) is how you will solve it. I like to use variables when I solve mathematical questions I would normally write as an equation or expression. For example, if I were to solve the above question I would most definitely choose the variable x as the answer as opposed to writing 16 + 3*16 + 4*(16)/(25% of 16)*5 + (1/2(1)*5)/(4*(1)/16). The reason that I use a variable instead of the full equation is that it helps me keep a better track of everything. It also helps me focus on each aspect. It is often a good idea to have some sort of strategy that you use to make calculations more efficient and help you solve problems more effectively. This is more of a personal strategy than a step by step way of solving something.\n\nWhen I first started doing examinations, I would normally solve questions without using a strategy. It took me a long time to get used to the idea of making my life easier, and instead just solve questions in the way I know how. It is, however, always good to change the way you do things and to try new strategies. However, keep in mind that the new strategy may not work for you either. Experiment and see what suits you best, but take your time and do one thing at a time.\nThe other thing that a lot of students struggle with is that \"A\" math answers are usually different then the other letters. A lot of the times in math you will be told whether to do addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc. So you must know which answer in the first letter that you need to be using. Make sure that you double check if you have written the right answer. If you find that you cannot write another answer, then check if you can get rid of one answer.

This could mean animals that start with each letter that has a name.\nHowever, looking at option E, it means the animal which starts with each letter except E or English alphabets.\nThat means, all animals in this options will have 'E' in its name. So, we cross-out choices B and C because these animals have 'C' in their names.\nAnd the letter 'E' is not in choices E and B.\nHence, the above reasoning makes it clear that the first letter which is not found in the name is E.\nSo, we should get 'E' as the answer.\nSo, the correct answer is E.\n\n\n*input: There are two types of questions where you have to ask for the right question to get what you want:\n**1.

{"idx": 835, "text": "If the question has asked how many green marbles Eric has, there are several strategies that can be used to answer this question.\n1. First strategy: You can first identify how many total marbles Eric has and then calculate how many green marbles make up the remaining marbles. This can be done by subtracting the number of white and blue marbles from the total number of 20 marbles, which gives a total of 8 green marbles. This is a straightforward method that can be effective for solving similar problems.\n2. Second strategy: One can also use multiplication to solve this problem by multiplying each type of marble separately (for example by 12 for the white, 6 for the blue, and 8 for the green) and then adding up the total number of marbles.\n3. For example, if Eric has 12 white, 6 blue, and 8 green marbles in total, his total number of marbles would be 26, which would be determined by 12 + 6 + 8 = 26.\n4. When you multiply each marble type by its corresponding quantity, it gives you a total of 96 as the product. This method can also be useful in solving questions about the number of balls in an urn or the number of cars in a certain parking lot.\n5. However, it is important to note that the multiplication method may not always be the most efficient approach, as the problem can be solved through division as well. \nSo if you divide 20 by the colors the person has, as a whole it is 20/3= 6 + 6 + 2 = 26\n6. An alternative mathematical method can also be used to solve this question.\n7. Using the PEMDAS method (parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction), one can recalculate the problem to make it easier to solve. This method involves using parentheses to group numbers, exponents for numbers with superscripts, multiplication for numbers with multiplication symbols, division for numbers with division symbols, addition for numbers with plus or minus signs, and subtraction for numbers with negative signs.\n8. The PEMDAS method can be applied to the mathematical problem described in the question posed.

{"idx": 836, "text": "1. From the question we understand that during the play 700 more cars came to theater.\n2. This would indicate that during the play, more people watched the play than the number of people who were at the theater before the play began.\n3. The question then provides the details for how the number of cars changed.\n4. Each parking lot the play was shown in was of the same size. Thus, the change in the number of cars in these two parking lots is only a factor of the time spent at the theater and the size of the theater.\n5. Taking advantage of the information that the play lasted three hours, we could then estimate the number of cars at the beginning of the play to be 100.\n6. The size of the theater is unknown and can be determined later.\n7. From one parking lot, the number of cars increased by 200.  This means that the original parking lot was full of 100 cars, with 200 cars added.\n8. Applying this information to the second parking lot indicates that its's capacity must have been 300 at the time the show began, since there were 200 additional cars added.\n9. If we assume the size of the theatres to be the same, then the total parking lot capacity must have been 400, since it was able to hold a total of 300 cars during the play.\n10.

{"idx": 852, "text": "1) Consider the case where no one loses any points. Suppose that both Jane and Bob each played with A and B. Then, at the end of the game, Jane has 90 points and Bob has 80 points, since: Jane's total = 60 points +10 points for each round, and Bob's total = 40 points +10- points +10 points = 50. Therefore, there is a total of only 9 rounds played in this case.\n2) When someone loses points, the overall sum of points reduces. In particular, Jane loses 20 points and therefore, the final point total for her is 40 points. Similarly, on the same turn for Bob, he also loses 20 total points. Bob's final point total at the end is 30 points.\n3) Thus, there is a total in all of: 9 rounds for Jane, and 3 rounds for Bob. So, the total number of rounds played was 12.\n4) Since there were a total of 12 rounds played in the game, this means that Jane played a total of 6 rounds. That is because she won 5 rounds and lost 1 round and each turn would account for 10 points. So, Jane won 50 points out of a possible 120 and Bob won 20 points out of 120.

Choices: 1 min | 5 min | 10 min | 8 min | 60 sec\nOutput: So there are two sides that the question is talking about that we need to pay attention to which are 1 min and 60 sec. 1 min refers to which side you should stand and hold the phone up from for how long. But if a min is it takes to stand on one side and get to the other side which is 8 min then it would take another 8 min to come back to the first side. So for each 3 times it would take 16 min. So it would take 8+8+8 = 24 + 16min which is 40 min to hold the phone at each side for 1 min. But then the question says 60 sec which means that only 60 seconds and not 60 minutes. So you only need to stand on each side for 60sec to complete the entire 180 sec. So it should be 180/2 = 90 seconds.

{"idx": 865, "text": "1. This question can be interpreted in two main ways. The first would be to calculate how many cups are brewed for the entire week. \n2. To do this, we need to find the total number of cups brewed by the coffee shop per day, times the number of days in the week. This would equal 10+120=130 per day. Then, we multiply 130 by the number of days, resulting in 930 cups per week.\n3. The second way of solving this question would be to find the daily average number of cups brewn per day and multiply that by the number of days. For example, 10+180=190 is the daily average for two weekdays and one weekend day. Then multiplying 190 by 5 gives a daily total of 950. Finally, multiplying 950 by 7 gives a weekly total of 6850 cups brewed. \n4. The correct answer is the second one because we already know the number of cups brew over the weekend and the number of daily average cups brewed over the weekend. There's no need to calculate it from the daily average. It's just about multiplying 95\u00d75 and it's enough!\nSo the final answer 6850\n\nInput:A doctor checks 3 types of blood test; glucose which costs $20, hemoglobin which costs $22 and cholesterol which costs $13, in a patient.

Since there are 20 knots in the total length of the rope, you need to deduct 20 x 1.2, or about 2.4 feet from 8000.\nStep 4. To do that, simply divide by 0.9. You should do 8000 / 0.9, and you should end up with 8886.666666. The number is rounded up.\nStep 5. In the end, you will have 8886 + 20. You will have 9086.

{"idx": 928, "text": "Answer: 100\n\n1.First of all we should recognize that the question wants us to find the total number of people including \"Ashley\" that attend a party.\n\nThis is to tell us that we can assume the question does not care about Ashley.\n\n2. We can see the question is specifically asking us to calculate the total number of people after half the number of the original invited guests each brought one more person to attend.\n\nWe can deduce that each invited guest can bring a number of people (n) equal to half the number (k) of original guests that each invited guest can choose to bring with them to the party.\n\n3. As of the original question, \"Ashley had a party, inviting 20 friends,\" we can see that n for each guest is 10, so the total number of guests that can attend the party is\n\n4. In order to solve the equations for each guest we must start with the second equation:\n\n\\begin{code}\n\nn\u00d7(1/2)= n\u00d7k\n\\end{code} so\n\n\\begin{blockquote}\n\nn=2k\n\\end{blockquote}\n\n5. As for the first equation we have:\n\n\\begin {code}\n 2m=20\n\\end{code}. We can solve m for m=10.\n\n6. Therefore, we can say that each person can bring 20+10=30 people to the party.\n7. From the question the second equation is the important thing.\n\nThe question says that out of 20 invited guests half invited 1 person but half invited 2 people. Hence our formula of n should be:\n\n\\begin {'n'} ={ \\begin {'k'} + \\begin {'k'} nx(1/2)\n\\end{code}}\n\n8. From looking at the question it could be noted that\n\n`\"half the number\" = 2.`\n\n9.

{"idx": 992, "text": "1) The question asks about flowering plants after six unicorns traveled side-by-side across a 9-kilometer path.\n2) So, to solve this, we need to determine the number of flowers that will be created in total, and the number of those that will bloom after this trip.\n3) Here, the question specifically mentions that any unicorn will create four flowers after each step, indicating that every flower generated is due to the presence of an individual unicorn. \n4) Since every flower is counted and is directly attributed to a specific unicorn, we will account for 5 flowers created for each unicorn for all the unicorns. For example, each of the six unicorns would create 30 flowers as they walk side-by-side. So, the count of total flowers for this question is 5 x 6 = 30.\n5) However, if we multiply the number of unicorns by the distance traveled (9 km) to calculate the total number of flowers for the trip, we get 5 x 9 = 45. But, as per the question, each unicorn will create only 4 flowers per step, which can also be written as 45 \u00f7 4 = 11.25, meaning that 12 unicorns must travel to place 45 flowers after the entire trip.\n6) So we see that the number of unicorna who will complete the journey will affect the overall number of flowers grown, and is not affected by the path they will take during their trip.\n7) In addition, the question indicates that each unicorn's step will produce four flowers, making it clear that unicorns will not move side-by-side; they will travel separately.\n8) Therefore, the solution is that unicorns that will finish the journey and produce 45 flowers are 45 \u00f7 (6-1) = 10 unicorns.\nSo the final count of unicorns that finish their journey is 10.\n\nInput: What will you likely do on Earth Day if you live near a park?

{"idx": 999, "text": "We must use the fundamental laws of physics and a few basic concepts from simple geometry to find an accurate answer. First, we'll start with the given variables and the information we're provided on how they change over time. We'll also assume that all the variables' units are in gallons.  Let's work with the volume first. According to the question, the volume of the pool is 60 gallons. Therefore, it's clear that the pool has constant volume when we're not given information on its change in time. We can see from the question that the rate of water fill is 1.6 gallon per minute.  It's crucial to note that the volume is directly related to the time required to fill the pool.   Let's work with two main variables and their relationships for the pool:   T = Total Time in minutes for filling the tank.  V = Total Volume in gallons for filling the tank. Let's denote the rate in flow with $f$. Thus, we know\n\n$f(t) = 60 \\times (t+0.1) \\times (t-0.1) \\text {   or } \\ \\ 1.76 \\times(t) \\times(t-0.1)^2$\n\nLet's plot V(t) vs. T to represent the volume of the pool as a function of time:\n\n$V(t)\\ \\text{vs.t} \\ \\ 60 x (t + 0.1) x (t - 0.1) \\ \\ x 1.76 x (t) x (t -.1) ^2$\n\n<p style=\"display: inline-block;\"><img src=\"./img/54.JPG\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" alt=\"54\"></p>\n\nFrom the graph, we can deduce that $V(t)$ is decreasing in value as $t$ increases. This is because the hose is leaking at a rate of 1.5 gallons per minute over the entire period that the tank is being filled. This is equivalent to $60 \\times 0.1 = 6$ gallons or 1.5 gallon per minute. The tank is being filled and this rate is reducing the tank's volume.", "answer": " 40"}

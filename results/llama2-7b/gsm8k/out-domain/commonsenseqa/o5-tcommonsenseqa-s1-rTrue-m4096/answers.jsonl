{"idx": 11, "text": "1 The question is inquiring about the number of people that the monster ate a hundred years previously, given that it consumes ships and people with a frequency of every hundred years, the ship has doubled in size, and it has consumed 3292 people over a period of 300 years. \n2 We can initially eliminate answer choices based on understanding the information in the problem. For example, in the initial period with a one hundred year interval and a monster consuming ships at the same rate as the number of people each ship currently has (or its cargo, which is the same thing), then the monster would consume 635 people (1 ship x 635 people). As this is an inadequate amount of people to be the number of people consumed over 100 years, it would not be the right answer. Additionally, the number of people on the ship is not necessarily equal to the number of people consummated (as sometimes it may be, but not always) and this is not specified in the question, so this does not help the answer. If the monster was to consume 100 people for every second that the ship was on this side of the ocean it would have consumed 560 people over a hundred years. This can be eliminated because it says the monster is consuming ships and sate its hungers once every hundred years, yet its fever is every second (as it is consuming 100 people on the side of the ocean that is closer to the ship at any given time). Answer choice B isn't applicable because it is not specific to the question. It could be assumed that the monster might take a break between consumption, but there is no way of knowing how long or how regular that might be, so this is not applicable. \n3 The remaining answers are A: 20, B: 310, and C: 847.  If we assume that ships may have been transporting more than one hundred years worth of cargo (which seems reasonable given that the ships have gotten so much larger over time, but which the question does not specify) then we can eliminate options C and B as we would have consumed two hundred years' worth of cargo, which is a much larger number than the number of people that would have been on that vessel.

{"idx": 27, "text": "1. Jack's objective is to acquire enough salt to season the fish he has caught.\n2. There is 2 liters of sea water that contains a total of 20% salt.\n3. When the water evaporates, Jack expects to end up with the same volume (2 liters) of salt.\n4. To find the amount of salt once water evaporates, the ratio of water to salt needs to be calculated.\n5. Since 20% is the percentage of the total salt in 2 liters, we can write 20% as 0.2L.\n6. We know there is 0.2L of salt, and 2 liters of water, meaning the amount of salt (0.2L) is 10 times lesser than the amount of water, (2L).\n7. This implies that when water evaporates, there is 0.1L (or 0.2L / 2) salt in the remaining volume of water (1L).\n8. There is therefore 0.1L of salt present in each liter of water after the evaporation of 2 liters of this solution.\n9. Since there is 2L of water present after the evaporation, we can conclude that there will be 0.2L (0.2L / (2L/1L)) salt present in each liter after the evaporation. \n10. We can then calculate the amount of salt present in any amount of salt by simply dividing it by 0.2 because this is the ratio between water and salt in the solution after evaporation, i.e\n11. 1L of water (remaining after evaporation) = 0.2L salt\n12. 2L of water (remained after evaporation) 0.2L = 2 salt\n13.1.5L water (remained after the evaporation) 1.25L = 1.5 salt\n14.Therefore, when considering 2 L of sea water to be 20% salt and the salt evaporated to end up with the remaining volume being 1 L of sea water: \n15. - There will be (0.2 L / 1 L) salt present in every liter of water.\n16", "answer": " 400"}

Leo could finish the first part of his assistant in 25 minutes, meaning he spent 25 - 1 = 24 minutes on it. The second part took him twice the time as the first.

In this scenario, the students receive allowance, and not pocket money, so option B: $30 in a week is not applicable.\n4. If we subtract the average dollar amount allowed per student ($4) from their average daily allowance ($6), the result is $2. Therefore, the answer should be negative due to this reason alone - $2 per day for everyone surveyed is a shortage of funds compared to their daily allowance of $6, making it unlikely that the students will be able to cover their daily expenses.\n5. Looking at the other options, we see that they all have dollar amounts that are smaller than the amount that was given out for daily allowance. However, options A and E have dollar amounts greater than the combined amount surveyed. This is because 60 * 2/3 * $6 + 60 * 1/3 * $4 = $3600, which is less than $4500.\n6. Therefore, the only answer options that can be ruled out are $400 and $7500.\n7.

To figure out how many pounds of the total weight the bear gained from eating small animals, let's assume it has consumed the weight it gained after each season. The bear has gained 1000 during summer, gained 1001 during autumn, and gained 1002 during winter. \n3. Hence, summing the weight it has gained during each season reveals a total of 2000. This is more than the original amount of weight it needed to gain during hibernation, so we want to know how much it gained from eating small woodland animals.\n4. The original amount it needed to gain was 1000. (1000 = 1000/1). Subtracting the amount of weight it needed from the total weight it gained, we get that it gained (2000-1000) = 1001 in total.\n5. We already know: \"During autumn, it devoured acorns and salmons. \" In total, it consumed acorns and salmos during autumn and gained the 500 (1/2) from this total amount.\n6. Subtracting the total amount it gained during autumn from the total amount it consumed during autumn, we can determine that it gained 500 from these items. 7. The bear consumed salmons and a portion of the acorns it gained during autumn to gain 500 for the end of autumn.\n8. Therefore: \"Small animals gave the bear a quarter of the weight it needed during winter.\" (200=125 and 300+25=125).\n9.

{"idx": 67, "text": "1. In this case, the questions seeks to solve for the number of months to pay off the balance considering the down payment.\n2. We know the total cost of the laptop ($1000) and the amount we pay per month ($65/month). It is assumed that the rate is fixed, meaning that we do not pay different amounts per month based on how many months we have made payments. This means we are considering simple interest.\n3. So, we need to figure out how much interest is gained each month. We can get this figure by dividing the total cost by the number of months, i.e., $1000/12 = $83.33 per month.\n4. We can multiply this by the down payment of $20 to get additional interest on the down payment. $20 x $83.3, which is $1666.6. So, every time a monthly payment is made, in addition to the $65 per month, Tara will make $1666 every 12 months.\n5. Finally, we add the amount we pay every month per the original question and we get the total, $423.33. Therefore, Tara should make 4 payments per payment of $423. \n6.

To prove this, it should be noted that in the Fibonacci series, 10=2\u00d75 and 5=2\u00b3. In addition to this, both the multiplicative inverse and factorials are mutually exclusive because factorials cannot be negative. To demonstrate that multiply is not the opposite of a factorial operation, we will prove by contrapositive. Negation is not a valid logical operation, but one can prove the contrapositive of a logical implication through negation of its contraries (Bhugra, 2018).

The approach consists of subtracting both incorrect answers from the original ones, to see whether their sum matches either of the two missing answers.\n5) First, we subtract B from A, to see if A and B both subtracting each other matches either D or E. A subtracted from B is 36. If 36 subtracts either D or E, then the sum matches D.\n6) Next, we subtract C from either B or A, again to see if A and C or B and C both subtracting each other match either D or E. If subtracting C from either B or D or C from either A or E will match either D or E, we have found our answer.\n7) This time, we subtract C from D, since subtracting C from D will match either B or C subtracted from each other which matches E or any other remaining answer, but C must match D because that option was already added back in from A and B's subtraction. Therefore, we find the answer E by subtracting C from D.\n8) This is the right path because the total for the four people is 103 kilos and, after subtracting the three incorrect answers, we get: 3 (subtracting C from B)-5 (subtracting B from A)-3 (subtracted D from C) which matches 103.\n9) Therefore, the answer is the same as the missing number, E.\nSo the final outcome is E\n\nInput: A carpenter made eight identical shelves.

Begin by considering the number 27 and figuring out how many pieces 27 people can share from 3 pieces.\n3. To break down the problem into smaller pieces, let's first find out how 27 people can each get 10 slices of a 3-piece cookie pie.\n4. We can easily determine that there will be 4 slices left if each of the classmates has 10 slices. 4 (slices left) + 2 (slices for Manny) + 1 (slice for Mr. Keith) = 7 people sharing 4 slices = 1 slice each.\n5. This suggests that if 3 pies are shared between 27 people, there will be 23 slices left.\n6. So the answer is 23 slices.\n\nOutput2:\n1. The question is how many slices were left after the cookies were distributed to the people. \n2. The answer in part 1 was already calculated to be 23 sliced. So, in order to answer the question, we must now figure out how many slices were remaining after 23 slices were taken. \n3. Let us reconsider the 1st part of the problem and consider how many fewer slices are left after 23 slicing out of the original number of 42 slices (27 people sharing 3 pies). \n4. This would mean that if 42 were sliced, then there would be 21 slices left after that.\n5. Or, we can say that 2 slices were missing, because 41 slices were left after 2 slices were taken out of the original number.\n6. By adding these two points 23 + 2 - 42, we end up with 21 slices.\n7.

He must have done some math and decided on buying soda with $2.00. \n3. If we subtract Peter's total cost by what he brought with him, we obtain $2.05 - $2.00 ($0.05). This means he paid $0.05 more. This suggests that $0.05 is the price for an ounce of soda. \n4. Subtracting $0.05 by the $2.00 that Peter started out with and the $0.05 difference, we get that Peter paid $2.15 ($2.00 + 0.05 + 0.005) for 16 ounces of sode.

But the judge is suspicious. She wants the prosecuting attorney to ask the defendant what he has in his pants. Choices:  A) Money B) Fake weapon C) Drugs D) A comb E) Nothing\nOutput: The prosecuting attorney is now posed with an interesting quandry - how to ask the defendant if indeed he has anything in his pants? This makes sense, as the prosecuting attorneys primary job is to procur evidence against the accused, to ensure that any wrongdoings have been committed (in the case-of-the-bank-robber), and have proper evidence for the judge/jury.\nThe first thing that would be done, would be to look at the case itself- a bank robbery. So the prosecuting attourney is in possession of all of the necessary evidence concerning the case, and the defendant is already in custody- making it relatively easy to ask him questions about the crime if necessary, should it come to that. The prosecuting attourny would of course go through the list of charges against the defendant, the nature of such crimes. He would likely ask if the defendant has a good defence to such crimes.. if they do, how they may come to the court with such a plan. However, one of the things that prosectors will also try and do, when evidence is seemingly missing is look for evidence in other places- like the pockets of a defendant for example- a good defnence is needed, and evidence of a defendant's other crimes would go a long way in terms of justicification. And also in terms of putting doubt in the mind of th judge, and jury- and then ultimately, ensuring that the defendant is charged accordingly, in the court room. In this way, the prosecuting attouney may well simply ask the defendant if he has anything in his trousers. He might say he does not, or he might have to say he does(in a non-malicous sense).\nThe answer chosen is A) because although money can be considered evidence of drug dealing or other crimes, these are", "answer": " 216"}

As a result, the extended number of hours worked is given by \\frac{10}{8} or \\frac{100}{80} = 1.25.\n5. Now, his earnings were originally $80 for 8 hours or $80*8 hours - this equates to $640.\n6. To find out the amount he earns, we need to multiply the earnings ($640) with \\frac{1.25}{2}$ which equals to 0.75.\n7.

When we examine the question, we can determine that there are two tanks where Gail keeps fish: the first one and the second one.\n3. There are 40 gallons (4 * 10) more water in the first tank than there is in the second tank. Therefore, we can assume that the size of the two tanks must also be different.\n4. Let's assume that fish in the smaller tank are two inches (a whole inch bigger than in the bigger tank), and fish in the bigger tank are three inches.\n5. If one fish from the bigger tank eats another, how many more fish can we fit in the same tank with them if we follow the same rule of one gallon per inch of fish?\n6. An assumption we can make here is that the bigger tank has already reached its limit of fish because the rule of one gallons of water per inch says that if there are three inches of fish, they will need three gallons of water.\n7. In this case, after eating another fish, each fish in the bigger tank will only need two gallons of water instead of three. The fishes in this tank will no longer be using the water they consumed, but will simply be filling up the empty space they have left.\n8. This makes room for a new fish to join the tank without using any water at all. \n9. Therefore, by following the rule of one gallong per inch of fish, the bigger tank can now hold 48 fish instead of 40 fish. On the other hand, if we place three-inch fish in a two-inch tank, we have to provide an extra gallon of water per fish. This only leaves us with an extra 24 fish in the one-gallon tank.\n10. However, the rule of one gallonic per inch of fish requires three gallons of water for each fish. Therefore, the two-inch fish cannot live in two inches of water.

She losesa(1 - 0.2)b marbles, she has(1 + 2)c marbles. where a and b are integers, c is a fraction. \n3)The question then asks us to calculate the answer in the form of an integer. There are 3 steps to figuring this out: \n4)Step 1 -> Baez lost 1/5 marbles: Since the total percentage decrease is 20%, and we need to find the whole number that represents % decrease since she did not lose any more marbles after that, we can use 3*(1/5) = 1/3. So she lost 1/5th of marbles. \n5)Step 2 -> Baez gained 2*2 marbles: Since her friend gave her 2*(100% - original) = 2*(1-20%) marbles (reminder -> original + 20%), this means Baez gained 5(1 - 20%) = 1 marbles. And thus, the new total is 2(101%) = 2 marbles.\n6)Step 3 -> Final answer -> We now consider the whole number that gives 96% decrease i.e: 96 - 100% = -4%. So the final answer is 2(1 - (-4)) =2(-6%) = 36%.

Choices: \nA: Dogs\nB: Cats\nC: Horses\nD : Cows\nE: Chickens\nOutput:1. The question wants to know which animal is not a pet.\n2.

Generally, pets are domesticated animals that are kept and cared for by people as companions and/or for enjoyment. Examples of popular pets include dogs, cats, and birds.\n4. From this, we can eliminate option A: Dogs. Dogs are a popular pet and would not meet the criteria for being considered a 'not a pet'.\n5. Option B: Cats could also be considered as not a pet as, cats do not require the amount of care and attention that many other domesticated animals do, like dogs, for example. \n6. Option C: Horses are seen as pets, as they are domesticated and rely on humans for care and food.

The answer is A: oil and water cannot mix.\n\nWe can determine that oil and water do not mix by conducting an experiment in which we mix our chosen liquids and record the results.\nFor this experiment, we collected two bottles, one containing water and other with olive oil. We then mixed the two liquids together, using a stir stick to create a blend of oil and water.\nWe observed that the liquids did not mix when we stirred them together. The water stayed on the top layer, while the oil stayed on the bottom layer, forming distinct layers rather than a uniform mixture.\nThis is a common observation and shows that indeed, oil and water do not usually mix.\nTo further verify this, we added more water to the bottle containing the mixed oil and water, and once again observed that the two liquids did not mix, remaining completely separate.\n\n#### 2.

{"idx": 164, "text": "1: The question is asking how many points above the old record did James's performance exceed by during the season.\n2. From the question, we know that James's performance is better than others on the team and that he manages to score six touchdowns in each game, with each touchdown being worth six points. This indicates that the overall number of points gained in a game would be 30 (6 points x 5 touchdowns).\n3. We also learn that James manages to score 6 touchdowns in each of the 15 games, and 2 points conversion 6 times total. This gives us the information that he received 30 touchdowns in total (6 touchdowns x 5 games).  \n4. From this information, James would have therefore scored a total of 420 points, given that each point in football is worth six (6) points. \n5. So, in order to answer the question, we must identify how many more points that is than the average of the previous record.\n6. We can eliminate option A as we know that James scored a total of 300 points more than the previous record:\ni. A x 6 = B\nii. B \u2013 C = D\niii. 1250 \u2013 C = D\n7. With these calculations, we conclude that A = 300, which leaves us to choose between the other four options.\n\n8. Option B has the biggest difference of score, and is therefore unlikely to be correct. If James did score 550 points more than the old record (300 + 250), the difference would be less than 200.\n9.

{"idx": 174, "text": "1: The question asks for how much of a head-start, in seconds, the turtle needs to finish in a tie. To be precise, this means the turtle needs a maximum 20 second lead, as at any point after that, the hare could catch it to tie the race. \n2: The question is asking how long the turtle needs in order to end the race in a tie. So, the turtle must move at a faster rate than the hare. \n3: There are 200 seconds in 20 feet. Let's work out how long each creature can move within this period to tie the race.\n4: We know that the turtle can move at 1 foot/second so its total progress will be a hundred feet.\n5: However, to finish the race in a tie, the turtle will need to move 200 feet. Hence, we know that the turtles total progress will be 200 \u2013 100 = 100 feet. \n6: Similarly, the hare will have to move 20 feet and, after that, will tie the race with the turtle. So, the hare's total progress will be 100 feet + 20 feet. \n7: Therefore, the hare can progress for: 100 + 20 = 120 feet before the race is tied. \n8: Putting these two values together, in order for the hare to tie the race, it must have moved by 120 feet. 9: However, this will take 120/20 seconds, so the hare must move at 6 feet/second to end the race in tie. This is our answer \u2013 the turtle must give it a head-start of 6 seconds.\nSo the final result is 6 seconds", "answer": " 18"}

Hence, his overall sticker collection is 10 less than what Mandy received. \n4) In a similar way, we can eliminate a few of the choices in the following manner: \n5) Choice B: 12 stickers as a third for each friend would add up to 12 in total, and the same reasoning is applied to Mandy (32) as well. \n6) Choice D: 49 is wrong because a friend only received 4 stickers and Colton has to give 4 stickers to Mandy.

It is essentially a proportion problem where we are asked to solve for the unknown (X).\n2: Let's start by understanding how Derek's finances will be distributed depending on the choices.\n3: We can begin by eliminating possible distributions of money. If we chose Option A: All spent on textbooks, we would not have enough money left for school supplies.\n\n4: Similarly, if a quarter of the remaining $80 was spent on school supplies, there would be no money left for textbooks, so we can eliminate option B: Spending on school supplies first, and then half of the remaining $85 on textbooks.\n\n5: So we can eliminate those options because we know that option A: All spent on books and option B: Spending school supplies first, and half of remaining $85, would not be the correct answer.\n\n6. We can eliminate option b) Spending on school supplies in next two choices because either we are left with $110 i.e. $960 - $58 (1/4 of remaining 85) or $88 i.e. 960 - 58(1/2 of remaining 85).\n\n7. But the question asks us the amount of money DEREK has left, hence the amount would be 960 - (58 + 29).

We can eliminate some choices that do not make sense, such as option A: Lisa bought 3 times as many t-shirts as Carly, but this doesn't match the conditions given in the scenario. \n2. There will be no significant difference if Lisa spends a quarter of the amount that Carly spends on their coats. This is an instance of the question. \n3. Similarly, if Lisa spent just two dollars on coats, we would expect that she spent at least three times as much on her jeans. This would increase the total sum of money spent more than necessary. Option C: Lisa spent twice as much money on jeans as Carly, is an example of the wrong question.\n4. In addition, we can eliminate option B: Carly bought just one third of the jeans that Lisa bought. It is not logical for Carly to spend just a quarter of the amount Lisas spends on coats, yet only buy one third of the jean quantity that Lisa purchased. This option makes no sense.\n5. So we're left with the correct answer choice of option D: both Lisa and Carly spent 30 dollars altogether. This is because if Lisa and Carly spent a quarter of what they spent on coat, their total spending will still increase. \n6.

{"idx": 194, "text": "1. The question is about the height of sunflowers from two packets, Packet A and Packet B. Here we have to find out the height of sunflower from packet B.\n2. First, we eliminate the possibility that the sunflowers were the same height: If the sunflowers were equal in height, Melody would not be able to tell that they were different packets.\n3. The next step is to eliminate any unlikely possibilities: If the sunflower plants from Packet B were shorter than 144 inches (20% taller), which is equal to 144 x 20 = 2880 inches, then they would not be the same length as the sunflowers from the other packet that grew taller than expected.\n4. From the given information, we can now use logical reasoning to determine a solution: The sunflowers from Pack B must be taller than 144 = 72, which is half the length of 2880 = 1440.\n5. Hence, the sunflowers from packet B were either 2240 inches tall (1440 = 3/4 of 2240) or 2,880 inches tall (2240 = 7/5 of 2,88 1i /4 of 2881 inches tall to make sure the answer is an integer.\n6.

{"idx": 195, "text": "1: The problem is asking about the total cost of the gift after Mr. Grey received a $12 credit rebate for purchasing everything using his credit card.\n2. First, we determine the sum of all costs including Mr. Grey\u2019s receipt of a $12 credit card rebate.\n3. This is simply done by calculating the total cost. The following is the formula:\nTotal cost = Number of items x Price of item ($26 + $83 + $90 )\n4. This formula is then rearranged as follows:\nPrice of Item = Total item divided by the number of items\n5. Using $26 as the price for 3 items of polo shirts and $83 for 2 necklaces, then the items are divided by the number of each item.\n6. The total price of each item is, therefore, $12 + $164 = $176 for the 3 polo shirt items and $146 for the 2 necklace items.\n7. So, total price = 244\n8. 3 polo shits are equal to the price of 7 necklaces. Hence, the price of 1 polo shirt =\n9. 2 neclaces.\n10.

Now we can cross out options B, D, and E because $2240 is less than $104, greater than $134, and greater than $186 (when rounded off). 9.

The calculation involves considering her running time on each day of the week, as well as the total time she is running each week. \n3. To answer the question, we would need to find the total time she runs each week, which is her running time on Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday. However, before we can add these times together, we need to convert them into the same unit. \n4. Currently, there is no specific unit of measurement for her running time. Let\u2019s use minutes as a unit of measurement to keep things simple. \n5. Then, the total time she runs can be written as: RunTime = running_time_on_Monday + running_time_onTuesday + running_time_ on_Wednesday + running_time on_Thursday. \n6. Let\u2019s assume Rosie runs for 1 minute on Monday. As Rosie's running time in minutes is equivalent to her running time in hours and minutes, we would substitute 6*60 with 3600. \n7. Our equation then becomes: RunTime = 1 + running_time_Monday + 30 + running_time_Wednesday = 360 + 30 = 390. \n8. This means that Rosie ran for 390 minutes in total over the week. \n9. According to the question, she must run 20 miles by Friday.

To answer, we use the price we were given for an individual candy bar, which is 4 dollars. We then find the total cost by using this information. \n3. To figure out the total cost, we need to start with the two prices and subtract the total cost ($28), yielding the amount spent for each individual candy bar ($2). If we add this value to the initial amount we were given ($28), the total now comes out to be $30, meaning that each candy bar cost $30. \n4. If we subtract the quantity of each, which was 5, from 28, we end up with $-23. Dividing $-23 by 5 yields a result of $-4.60. We therefore round this value up to the nearest whole number, which is 5, as there is no $0.05 candy bar, giving us the correct answer of $15 for each candy bar.\nSo the final value is $15 for each of the candy bars.\n\nInput: There was an accident in the parking lot where a bus collided with a car. 10 passengers were injured, but fortunately 4 escaped uninjured.

{"idx": 212, "text": "1. Last year she paid 1000$ for rent, 200$ for food, and 100$ for car insurance.\n2. This year her rent went up by 30% but food went up by 50% and car insurance went up by 3fold.\n3. 30% of 1000 is about 300. So if 300 is going to be a large part of her expenses and the rest of the expenses went up (car insurance by 3x and food by 50%) then total expenses went up by at least 300 plus (4)50% which is at least 1570.5$.

Choices: \tA: 73F is higher B: 81F is higher C: they're both the same D: neither is higher\nOutput:1. We are given two values, but are not told the units of measurement between which they are compared. However, we can be 99% sure that temperature is the unit of measurement for both. \n2. So we can choose to first eliminate the options that have higher temperatures than 81'F, then those that have lower temperatures, and so on, until we have our answer.\n3. We can eliminate option B: 81'F is higher, because it is higher than 73'F. (81 > 73 )\n4. We can also eliminate option C: same, because they aren't higher or lower than each other. (1)81'F is not greater than or less than 73'f. 81 = 73. )\n5. Therefore, we are left with only one possible answer: option A, 73'F is higher.\nSo the final conclusion is A: 73F > 81F\n\nInput: What was the score for the first half of the game?

{"idx": 213, "text": "1. The question is about how many hours Randy needs to practice each day, on average, to become a piano expert in a few years.\n  2. The answer can be broken down into two parts: The number of hours per day needed to practice and the duration of his practice.\n  3. First, we calculate the duration of practice. \n    1. Suppose Randy works on his piano expertise for 10 hours every day for 5 days a week, Monday - Friday, and 6 hours every day on Saturdays and Sundays, (Monday - Sunday), for the rest of his life. His total number of hours of practice would be:\n        1. Duration = (10h*5d) + (6h*2d) + (6x2days) = 140h * 52 weeks *2 years = 7800h = 78h/8 = 11h/day * 52w = 11x52 = 584w =13y=7800h/584w.\n        2. Let's round up the final number to the nearest whole number:\n            1, Rounding to the nearest whole number using rounding value =10\n        3. We can see that Randy has roughly 782 days to practice from the age of 12 till the age 19, so he would have to practice at least 782 hours to become a piano master before he turns 20.\n    2. Next, let' s estimate the average number of hours of daily practice in Randy\u2019s lifetime. From 782 * 5.5 = 4363hrs = 436,300s we will take into account the fact that no one can practice for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so we can assume that it\u2019s more realistic to practice at most 10 hours a day, for instance:\n            1. 78x5=390h. Therefore, if Randy were to practice every day, excluding the two weeks he takes off for vacation each  year, Randy would have to practice 782 hrs / 390h= 2 days.\n            2.

{"idx": 222, "text": "1) This is a math question asking the answer to the question of how far Mira can jog in five days if she jogs 5 miles/hour for two hours each morning.\n2) The key to solving this question is to first understand the relationship between miles jogged and time taken, as the question does not directly ask for the number of miles jogged in 5 days. Based on the information given, we know that Mira can jog 5 miles in 2 hours.\n3) Let's consider the formula for distance (x) traveled in time t, where d is the speed (x) in miles per hour (m/h).\n4) Plugging in the values from our scenario, we see that the answer is: x = 2h /(5m/h) = 5miles. \n5) In other words, Mira can jog 50 miles in five days if she runs for two hours each morning at a speed of 5 miles/hour. \nSo the final answer for the question above is 50 miles. \n\n\nInput: John was bending the stick.

So, the total money spent on food is the answer we seek.\n6. To answer, we eliminate 1 and 3 and eliminate C.\n7. A implies that we spend money eating dinners. But we want to answer in total. If we spent money only on food and on food which includes dinners and drink, dinners and drinks is already included. So, A is incorrect.\n8. C implies Dinners and drink is included in total cost. But this is already included. So B and C are incorrect.\n9. D implies that we spend $ on drink. This is incorrect too. So all options except 1, 3, C are incorrect.\n10. Now we want to choose B and G that only includes $ in food and G is money spent on food. So B is an option and so is G.\n11.

A street in New York City with different one-way streets. 2. 5 B: 4 C: 5 D: 4 E: 3 A street in Boston. 3. 5 B: Different 8 streets without any one-way streets.\nOutput: The answer is option A, option B, and option C. In order to get from point A to point C, there has to be at most one turn or interchange in the course. The question is asking how many different routes can be taken between two arbitrary points. We could take this definition of route to mean a sequence of straight lines, i.e., a line segment. If a person had to go from A to C, there are only two possible routes they could take: a. Go straight down avenue B, and take an instantaneous \"left turn\" onto avenue C. b. Go straight down a different avenue, then take an instantaneous \"right turn\" onto avenue \"C\". In both cases, there are two possible directions (left and right in this case).

{"idx": 233, "text": "1. The question is about a family with four children whose birthdays are all on the same date.\n2. We are asked how old the last child in the family is.\n3. We know that this child was born two years after the third child was born. This means that the third child was born two years before the fourth child.\n4. We also know that the third child was given birth to on the fourth birthday (and not the third) of the second child, since the first child was born 15 years ago and we know both their birth dates.\n5. Finally, we also know that both of the third and fourth child's birthdays are the same as the second child's.\n6. Therefore, we can conclude that the question asks us to find out how old the third child is (in years).\n7. To find the answer, we can begin with the information we have. We can assume that the second child was born 14 years prior to the birth of the first child.\n8. Additionally, we know that the third child's birthday (of the fourth birthday) is on the fourth birthday, meaning it occurs exactly 4 years after the birth of the second child.\n9. If we multiply the first figure of the year with that number, we will get the second figure of the year. Let's use an example. If the first figure of 2022 is 2, the second figure must also be 2.\nSo the final year is 2022.\n10. Subsequently, we know that the 3rd child's birthday is on the fourth birthdate of the second child. We can eliminate the choices: B: first birthday as the fourth birthday does not come on the first birthday.\n11. We can also conclude that the fourth child was born on the third birthday of the second child; however, we will not need this information to answer the question.\n12. Therefore, to calculate the age, we can multiply the first number of the year with \"14\" (which is the number of years prior to the birthday we are given).\n13. This will give us the second number of the current year.\n14. Multiplying the year of the third birthday to the result will give us the fourth, and thus, we know the correct option is E: 2", "answer": " 8"}

Choices: A. Longer B. Shorter C. Lighter D. Stronger E Longer\nOutput: 3. To answer this question we need to understand what the word \"dense\" means in this context, as there might be more than one possible answer depending on how dense the article was.\n4. From the definition of \"dense\", we can infer that it means \"containing a large number of facts or details\". 5. In this particular context, we can safely rule out options C and D that mean \"lighter\" and \"stronger\" respectively, because they do not make logical sense.\n6. Option E can be ruled out as well because the options here involve lengths, not weights.\n7. We are left with options A, B and E. 8. Option A: \"Longer\" is not suitable because if an article is more dense, it does not naturally result in it becoming longer. The article has become longer due to increasing its number of facts, details, or content. \n9. Option B: \"Shorter\" does not fit here as an article becoming shorter means it is either losing facts or details or has fewer of them. This is not what our article is doing when it is becoming denser.\n10. So the only option we can choose is E. \"The dense newspaper article can become longer by adding facts\".\nSo the final answer could be E: longer\n\nInput: Which is the largest of 4: 10, 15, 30, 64?\nOption A: B: C:D:", "answer": " 40"}

Firstly, you can easily eliminate some of the answer choices - A: 15 Easter eggs B: 30 Easter eggs C: 60 Easter eggs D: 100 Easter eggs E: 120 Easter eggs\n3. Next, you can use some basic math to narrow down the answer choices. You can say that the total of 10 Easter eggs Tank collected should be less than the total of Emma's eggs collected in the 1st egg hunt round. This is true and is equivalent to B: 30 eggs since Tank took 10 more eggs than Emma, B: 30 must be less than the number collected in the 1rst round which was 40.\n4. You can also say that the answer should be equal to 2 times as the number of eggs collected by Tank in the 1rth round.

It is clear from her statement that she bought 3 lbs of coffee.\n3) Additionally, it is known that each lb of coffee can brew about 4 0 cups of coffee when the whole lb, 3 lbs, is used.\n4) It is important to understand what \"brew\" means in this context. Typically, \"brewed\" implies that the coffee is ready to be consumed. In other words, each lb of coffee can result in 40 cups, or 160 oz, of brewed coffee.\n5) Next, it is necessary to understand how much coffee Angiel drinks every day. She drank 3 cups of brewed coffee every day.\n6) Finally, one can use the information from steps 2 through 5 to arrive at the conclusion. By multiplying 3 lbs of cffee by each cup that a lb of coffee can brewed 40 cups and subtracting the number of days Angie drinks 80 oz of coffee, which is 80/160 = 0.5, gives 2.5 days.\n7) Therefore, the answer is 2:5 (or 2 and a half) days\n\n#!/bin/bash \n\nfunction getUserinput() {\n    echo \"Please enter a word that has more than three letters\"\n    read word1\n    \n    return $word1\n}\n\nfunction getUserInputAnswer () {\n    echo \"Your word with more than three letters is : $word1\"\n    return $word2\n}\n\nword1=$(getUserinput)\nword2=$(getUserInputAnswer)\n\n\n\necho $word1\necho $word2\n\nInput: What color is the sky?

After the second hour the shadows will have extended a total of 15 ft from 0, which after the third hour will be 20 ft, 4 hours after noon, the shadows will be a 25 ft additional and 6 hours after noon they will be a total of 30 ft additional.\n6) Since the question is asking for inches, we multiply feet by 12 and then multiply it by 0.08 to convert feet to inches (5 x 12 x 0.08) which gives us an answer of 152.4 in which the shadow length reaches 6 hours after noontime.\nSo the final step is to put the numbers in the correct order and get the answer of 15 ft + 1 ft + 0 ft = 17 ft and rounded to the nearest 0.4 inch is 17 inches.\nTherefore, 6 hours since noon there is 17 inches shadows.\n\nInput: I didn't have my phone on me.

On the second day of the week (Monday), he went back to making his normal earnings (which are around $20 per day) which he continued to do for the rest of the week, ending with another $20. In total, he earned $120 on this second week. \n4. The question asks how much John needs to earn on his earnings from the next week (third week) to have the $60 that he needs to buy a pogo stick.\n5. We can start by counting how many weeks it takes to save the $60. Each week, he saves $12, and this takes 5 weeks (as he has to save $60). \n6. Looking at John's first week, we can see that he saved half of his weekly amount on the other time, i.e., $6.5 on two extra days (Sunday and Monday).\n7. Using this extra $6.5 and the information that he makes $20 (on everyday, including Saturday) on each week, we can figure out that he needs to save $26.5 on the entire next week (third week). \n8. This means saving $26.5 (for four days) on the first day, and this would be impossible given he earned only $4 that day (Sunday). \n9. Therefore, to finish the calculation, we can include the days that have passed in the week before and estimate the earnings.

{"idx": 275, "text": "1. The question is about finding out which of the following three numbers is larger: 24, 15, or 31. 2. In order to get the three values in question, we need to solve for them from the following equation: Mabel has 8 times as many marbles. Mabel has twice as many marbles. Amanda has 6 more marbles. We first need to find out the value of 12, or how much Amanda needs to have to have twice as many as Katrina, since the equation says Amanda has 6 marbles more than Katrina. This can be derived by subtracting the two equations: Mabel has 6 times as many marbles, and Amanda has 6 additional marbles. 12 is how much Amanda needs. 3. 24 is the answer for the first term we seek: Mabel has 12 times as many marbles (with 12 being the key to solving both of the two equations in this case). 4. Given that Mabel needs 12 times as much of something as Amanda does in order to have twice as many, this means that there is an interval between what Amanda needs and what Mabel needs (which in this case is 12). This means that Amanda needs 24 more marbles (of course she needs 12 in order to have twice the number of marbles that Katrina has, and Mabel also needs 24 to double the number of marbles). 5. 24 and 12 do not add up to 12. This means that 12 is a smaller number than the first interval, which we can therefore conclude means that 31 is not more than 24 and is smaller than 12. 6. 15 (or Mabel) is the smallest number which satisfies the given conditions.

So the following question is, each girl receives 'k' (unknown) eggs and 'l' (unknown) boiled eggs. But the total number of eggs that each girl got is equal to 'k' + 1.

We can identify the difference between the 2 phases of this cycle by looking at the organelles used in the production of ATP (the main currency of energy within cells) and the proteins that make up the structures of cells. At the adult stage, mitochondria and various enzymes that provide ATP are present in sufficient quantities and work effectively during flight, but are absent in the caterpillars. The same goes for the skeletal protein called keratin that prevents protein-water separation in cells and keeps the cells in liquid form. All these organs are absent in the catterpillar phase, and are present only in the adult stage. We can expect the adult", "answer": " 21"}
{"idx": 298, "text": "1. This question asks us to find the average number of words in each crossword puzzles.\n2. Let's begin by finding the total number of words written by Bert each day. This can be represented as the equation - T=W1 + W2 + W3 + \u2026+ Wn. T stands for total words and each letter stands for the number of words each day.\n3. Now, we know the total that Bert uses in each crossword puzzlearily in a pencil. This can be represented by P=R1 where P stands for the total and R stands for the number of crossword puzzles Bert fills.\n4. Thus, the relationship between each of these variables becomes P=W1/2 + W2/2 + W3/2 + \u2026+ Wn/2.\n5. We can make it into an equation: P=T1.5. To solve this equation, we divide both sides by 1.5 to cancel it out. Thus - P=T/1.5 or (P-T)/1.5\n6. Substitute the values n to make the equation, P - T/1.5. \n7. Let\u2019s call the given value of T as T_given and the value of P obtained after solving the equation as P_obtain. Then P_obtain - T_given = 1050/1.5.\n8.

Since it takes two square feet, we can use the equation 4'=10, which means to get 2 square feet, we need to multiply two by 10 and 20, to get 80 square feet.\n4) The total square feet needed in this equation can be simplified as \\(2+3+80=82sq ft\\). \n5) Since we are told that the second and third presents take the same amount of square footage as the first present, we can substitute (or replace) 82 with 82 in the following equation: 2+3+44=82.\n6) We have to remember to simplify this equation by using \\(3+44=47\\) to simplify the equation to 2+47=49.\n7) Since three-quarters of one amount equals 0.75, we can represent it as 3/4 of one. \n8) Therefore, to calculate the total square feet of paper needed, we can rewrite the equation like so: 2+0.75(49) = 49.25.\n9) After simplifying the equation, the total wrappings needed can be represented as 80+0.75x49 = 49.75 square feet.

Since there are three farmers and Farmer Bob is growing three different crops, we can assume that each farmer needs a different amount of water to irrigate their crops.\n3. Since Farmer Bob is growing 3 acres of corn and 24 acres of cotton, water for corn will make up 420/360 units while cotton needs 3,360/360=9 units. So far, farmer Bob requires 1008 gallons of water.\n4. To irrigate Farmer Bernie's 2 acres of corn requires water equivalent to 14 gallons and for 12 acres of corn needs water equivalent to 50 gallons. Bernie's beans will consume 500/2 = 250 gallons of water. Thus, Farmer Bernie needs 799 gallons.\n5. Lastly, Farmer Brenda is growing 23 acres of corn, which requires 491/20 gallons of irrigating water. As she requires additional water for each farm, these requirements add up to 491+1008+799+9+297=1804 gallons.\n6. So the total water used for the all the three farmers is 1804 gallon.\n7. Since Bob has the largest area(3 acres), he also needs the most water(1008 gallon).\n8. Bernie needs more water overall, with 799 gallon for corn, and then 250 gallon for beans.\n9.

Janet's salary tax percentage is 10%, which implies that she must pay 10% tax on each employee's earnings.

{"idx": 314, "text": "1. the question is asking how many toys total do the two boys have.\n3. We can figure out how to solve this on our own or use the provided calculator to get the exact answer.\n4. However, in either case, we would need to know the total number of toys Bill has.\n\n5. Option 1: The number of toys Bill must have must be greater than or equal to 50. This is because, for each boy, the sum of their toy count must be 150. \n6. Since Hash has half as many as Bill, Bill must have 9x toys to equal the number of toys Hash has \n7. Given that Hash has 50 toys, Bill would then need a minimum of 50+(50*3/2) = 90.\n\n8. Option 2: We could use the provided calculator, which has values set to 50 and 50*1.5 for Hash and Bill, respectively.\nThis will give us a result of 61, which is below the minimum result of 90.\nAlternatively, we could do the calculations ourselves if we prefer to do so. \nOption 3: We could also choose Option 2 and then divide that answer by 2, as we are asked to find the total number and not the total number for one boy alone.\nDividing by 2 gives a result of 30.5, which is the correct answer.\nAlternatively we could again do the calculations as we prefer. \nOption 4: A more intuitive approach would be to know that Bill, being the second boy, is one less than half of Hash, 3/2 times the number of Hash. \n\n9. We can replace Bills number of toys with Hashes number to get a second equation, 3/2 * Hash = Hash + 3/2* Hash (assuming we want the value after adding the 3/2 number).\n10. We can then solve these with either the calculator or math equations and get 27.5. Alternatively, we could also solve these manually.\n11. The final answer for how many toys do the boys' possess is D: 27.5\nSo the final answer to the question \"Hash has nine more than 50", "answer": " 99"}

We found out that there are 60 packs that contain 7 cards each, it means there are 420 cards in total. 2) After that, we can calculate the number of pages that's need to be bought. When the card is being collected, there are total 60 packs being bought and each one of them contains 7 cards on average. Also, when we need to protect the card, we want each page to hold 10 cards, it means each page can accommodate to different pack numbers, each time the packs change, the number of cards on each page is a bit different. \n\n| Page | Total number of cards/pages | \n| --------- | --------------------| \n| 1 | 420/10 = 42 cards/page |\n| 2 | 420 - 42 =378 cards/page |\n\nIn this scenario, the number of pages should be at least 38 and the last 3 pages should accommodate 40 cards/page. 420 - (40+3)*4 = 300 cards. 300/10 =30 pages, and we should have an extra 3 pages, for a total number of 33 pages in total.

{"idx": 358, "text": "1) There are 6 different types of fish that Catriona has in her aquarium. \n2) First let's focus on the question. \n3) To solve this question, we must use the four given sets of information. Angelfish is different from goldfish. That is why we can't use this fact at the beginning to solve the question. So the first thing to do is to eliminate this fact. \n4) The difference between goldenfish and angelfish is that \"Angelfish can live to be twenty years old but goldfish only live to be ten.\" \"Angelfish cost twice as much as a goldfish\". By focusing only on the question and the 4 facts, we can eliminate that Catriona has only angelfish and goldfish. \n5) Now we're left with: she has 4 more angelfish than goldfish. We can use this fact to multiply by 3. Why 3? Because it takes 3 angelfish to be enough to equal to 1 goldfish. Therefore by multiplying 3 by 4, we can find the total number of goldfish in the aquarium. The answer is Catriona has 3*4=12 goldfish in her aquamirum. \n6) The next question is how many angelfish does Catriona have. We know how many goldfish she has. If Catriona had 4 more angelfished than goldfish, then the final sum would be Catriona -4= -4 angelfish. So there are -4x2= -8 angelfish. \n7) Catriona has 8+4=12+-8= 4 angelfishes in her aquarium.

This means that 95 burgers still need to be cooked (15 * 6 + 95 = 111, where 6 = how many times he's already cooked burger patties)\n3) Based on the requirements, Ronald needs to cook 15 burger portions five more times in order to finish all burgers for the party in total.\n4) Therefore, we could write this as: 15 * 6 = 90 burger portions and he would need another 5 sessions to cook the remaining burgers for the party.\nSo the final answers are F: 5 sessions and 5 * 15 = 75 more burger portions", "answer": " 5"}
{"idx": 373, "text": "11 minutes.\nTo determine the average time per kilometer for the entire race, we can calculate it by first finding the total time it took for TJ to complete the entire race, then dividing the total time by the total distance; that is, we take 10 kilometers and divide it by TJ's total time of 50 minutes. This results in an average time of 10km/50m = 10/50 = 10/12 = 0.83/min. Thus, we can deduce that TJ's average time per kilometer for completing the entire race of 10K is 8.3min/10K = 0.8min/km, or an average of 11 minutes. \n\nInput: What is the name of a type of dance that is always rhythmic and in time?

We further know that each Large Tub is $6, which implies they are cylinders, thus having a radius $r$.\n3.) It follows from the constraint that the large ones are $6$ and the small ones are $6$, if $x$ are small and $x$ are large, then the price must be $x+x$, or if we denote the large tubs by L, and the small tubs by S, then the total price has to be L+L+S+S+...=nL+nS\n4.) If then (which is obviously true), the large tubs cost \\$6, it follows that the sum of the prices of the small and the large tubs is \\$48. There can be 3 or 6 of the price \\$6 of small tubs, for a total value of \\$12 or \\$16 (which is equal to \\$48/3 or \\$48/6). \n5.) From here, we know that the large tubs cost $\\\\$6\\times\\$x$, of which $x$ are large and $6-x$ is small. \n6.)

{"idx": 395, "text": "1) The question gives us the data points to solve it as follows:\n\n    Chad needs 5 boxes of cracked\n    He gets 28 crackers per box\n2) The answer to this question lies in simply using one of the 4 variables to create a simple proportion (as we did in grade 9) in order to discover a possible equation. We can find the total amount of crackers by finding how many nights it takes for Chad to have used up 5 boxes of crackres, or in other words:\n    Total crackers = 5 * (28 per box)\nHence, \n    Total crackers is equal to 28(5) = 140 crackers \n    So if he eats exactly 5 boxes, he will eat exactly 140 crackres.\n3) Since the question states that he eats 5 boxes of crack-ers \"a night\", we subtract the number of boxes eaten to figure out how many boxes are left:\n    Last box is exactly 1 box (the total number of boxes he has eaten - 5 box)\n    If he eats each box exactly 1 night, the last box gives him 1 night, which is equal to 5 nights and not 1 box, and the difference is 4 nights\n4) It is clear that he ate exactly 4 boxes. What we need to do now is to find out how many nights he spent eating each box.\nTherefore, we can create two simple equations to help us determine how many nights it took to eat each box:\n    Total number of nights it took him to eat 1 box is equal to 4\n    Total number of boxes (in this case) is exactly 5\n5) We know that total number of nights it takes him to eat 1 full box is exactly 4.

To start, we will need to convert the insulin pills to a common denominator by dividing the total number of pills per week by the number of insulin pills she needs each day.\n4. Using the given information about Holly's medication, we will assume that she takes a total of 32 blood pressure pills each week, and she takes twice as many anticonvolsants as she takes blood pressure pills.\n5. As a result, we will take the number of pills she takes in one week, divide it by 4 (the number of blood pressure pills she has), and multiply it by 8 (the number of anticonclusants she takes), giving us 29.6 anticoonulsants (the number of pills we'll take, which we rounded up to 30).\n6.

But half of all the students in the class are absent. There are 5 people in the class that were absent; so, each person had a 1/5 chance of being absent. The probability that one student was absent can be calculated as:P(absence) = 5/5 = 1P(a student was absent) = 5/20 = 1/4The probability that exactly 1 student was absent can be computed by multiplying the probability of one student being absent by the product of the odds of two, three or no absences. This yields:P(exactly 1 absent) = ( 1/4) (1/(1 + 2)) = 10/24The probability that a second student was absent can be found from the probability of exactly 2 absences:P(exactly two absent) = ( 5/20) = ( 25)/(20) (1/4) (2/1) = (1/2) (5/10) = 1P(no absences) = 20/20 = 20 P(no absences) can also be determined by multiplying the probability if one student was absent by the product of odds of no absences.

{"idx": 399, "text": "1. The question is to figure out the amount that the girl scouts have leftover after buying tickets to the pool.\n2. The main information that we can work with, is the $30 that is collected from selling the cookies. This gives us the total amount that the girl scout are selling cookies for and have collected.\n3. We can then deduce the total number of cookies that are being sold as well. The statement says that their sales were $30 total. If each set of cookies costs $35, then the total number of sets that can be sold for $30 is 30, or 6 boxes of cookies.\n4. We have some more information available on the second part of the question. The statement says that it will cost the girl scouts $2.50 to go to the pool and that 10 people are planning to go. \n5. If we can find another way of representing this information, that will help us answer our initial question. Let's represent 10 people as 10s and 2.50 as $.25. \n6. This way we can rewrite 10s as 10, thus giving us: $2.50 * 10. This leads us to another conclusion. If it costs $2.50 for 1 person to go to the pool, then each ticket costs $.25, or 25 cents. \n7. We can use this information to calculate the amount that the girl-scouts are going to have left over if they purchase the full set of tickets. This calculation is: $2.5 * 10. If they purchase the full set then they will each end up having $.25 left over for any other purchases or snacks. \n8. We can simplify and write this amount as: $.25 * 10 = $2.50, which is what the initial statement said each ticket cost.\n9. If each set of tickets cost $2.50 then each ticket has a value of $.25.

In the context of this scenario, Frank's actions will be more relevant in getting him closer to or further away from the target number. He needs to keep on meeting the target number or else he will fail. \n3. The options given consist of: 1) the days taken while meeting the quota (B,C), 2) the total number of car sales in a month (A, E), and 3) the remaining amount on his daily quota (D). \n4. B, C are irrelevant if the quota is to be met within the remaining 27 days. Even if they are met, it is still impossible to meet the quota. \n5. A,E give the total number of cars Frank sold in the month but are irrelevant to the question. Hence we can cross them out. \n6. D, the remaining amount of cars needed to be sold in a day to meet the quota is related to Frank's quota. But it cannot be met in a 27 days, even if he sells 15 cars per day. \n7.

{"idx": 411, "text": "1. The question is about how many hours Mark would need to jump rope in order to beat the record of 54,0\n2. To answer the question, we need to first understand the context and constraints of the situation. \n3. Mark wants to set a record for most consecutive rope jumps, and this record is currently held at 54,0. \n4. Since Mark can jump 3 times per second, we know how often he can jump. \n5. To get the number of jumps required to beat the current record of 540, we can subtract 540 from 3 times 60 minutes (60 minutes = 1 hour), since each minute has 60 seconds. We then take the remainder after subtracting these two numbers. In this case, it is 12600 jumps - 5400 jumps = 7200 jumps. \n6. The question then asks us how many hours it would take Mark to complete 7200 rope jumps. \n7. Let's first consider the 1-second interval between each jump. In a minute, there are 60 seconds, and in a 1-second interval there are 60 1-second intervals.  In 7200 1-second interval(s), there are 7200/60 = 120 minutes or 2 hours and 0 minutes.  Then, the remainder comes to be 30 minutes.  This means that there are 2 hours and 30 minutes in total required for Mark to make 7200 successive jump rope movements. \n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is 143 minutes = 2 hours and 13 minutes.\nSo the final Answer is A: 143 minutes\n\nInput: What is the capital of Canada?\nOutput: The capital of Canada is Ottawa.

Then we apply the PEMDAS rules to rewrite the expression: Total number of students in both school level=3 times the number of students of elementary school. 2.We can use the Distributive Property to rewrite the expression:  Total number of students in the elementary school level=4 (Total number of students in middle school level) - 3 (Total number of students of elementary level) And we can do the same for middle school level:  Total number of middle school students= (Total number of elementary student) - (Total number of elementary school student) 3.When we compare the equations:  Total number of elementary school students =25,  Total number of intermediate school students =50, and  Total number of elementary students =3 times the number of intermediate students, the number of intermediate students =50 will not work. It should be 3 times greater than the number intermediate school students. 4.The difference between them is that the intermediate students = [3 times (25)+50] and 3 times (25) is [3 times (2x5)] so it's not equal to the number of intermediate students. So, 3 times intermediate student-3 times elementary students=85. We can apply the distributive property to the term \"the number  of intermediate students times 3\" to get the value of the \"total number of  elementary school students\": =50-3(50-3) ;3 times intermediate school student = 50-30;So the  elementary school student is 20 students. 5. The problematic term in the expression (2x85) will increase by distributing it to the multiplier's term 3. [2(20)+3(20)] =50 Total number of elementary school [elementary students + total number of elementary students] =50+70 ;the difference between the numbers elementary school students(25) and 3 times the number elementary school students (70) will be(25- 70)=-45.

The first day, she produces 50 eggs which doubles to 100 on the second day. The third day, she produces 102 eggs, which is 20 more than on the second day. On the fourth day, she doubles this to 204 which is then doubled again to 408 eggs.\n3. From the information provided in the situation, we know that the total number of eggs on days 1--4 is equal to or less than 500. This is based on the fact that there is no limit on the number of eggs a frog can produce each day. The answer can be found by subtracting the number of eggs laid on day 1 from 500 which gives us 300. 408 + 408 +408 +417 = 500 + 500 ------\nChoices:\nA) 50 A. the frog laid 200 eggs over the course of the 4 days, B) 524. the frog laid a total of 524 eggs, C) 527. the frog laid527 eggs, D) 529. the frog laida total of 532 eggs, E) 640.the frog laida totalof 640 eggs.\n4.

I have determined that only English books can be found in the library and not other languages. I also know that of these books, 80% are in English.\n3. This means that only 20% are in other languages.\n4. Therefore, of the books in the library, at most 20% could be in other languages (rounded).\n5. The English books found in the library, at least 60% (rounded) are in the country.\n6. I know that of all the books in the library at least 600 books will be in the country (rounded).\n7. From this, I can figure out that there will be at least 2300 \u2013 600 = 1700 English books in the library that are not in the country (rounding).\n8. Therefore, at least 1700 non-English books will be in the library. But the library only has 2300 English books.\n9. Therefore, English books published outside the country would be no more than 1700 / 2300 = 25% of total books.\n10. Now I subtract how many books will not be the same as how many books I already assumed. 25% - 20% = 5%.

There can be several actions that a child takes to accommodate new baby.\n3. Therefore, answer to this question would be 'c'. as 'c' is the list that includes'moving in next door' or 'visiting'. Therefore it is safe to say that any of the list of answers are the one that could be used for the given question. 'Die' is out of list as it is not a likely action when it comes to siblings especially.\n4. The first action we eliminate from the answer is 'die'. This is because this is the action that is least likely to happen. 'Die' is also not an action that is possible.\n5. Then we eliminate 'die'. This is due to the fact that it is physically impossible for a sibling to die.

{"idx": 450, "text": "The number of spider legs among the group of spiders would depend on the total number of spiders in the group. To find the total number of spidder legs, we start by breaking down the problem into two parts: the first part is finding the total number of a single spider, and the second part is finding the total of a group of spiders. The 8 legs of a single spider are the answer to the first part of the problem. The second part of the problem can be divided into two, in which case the total number of legs among a group with x spiders is (1 + x/2) legs.

Choices: 100, 101, 102, 103, 104\nOutput: The number with the fewest factor pairs is 102. Choosing the factors to each number, factor pairs are multiplied together to be greater than 100. The factor pairs that have greatest products between each number can be compared, and the highest product can be compared to the smallest product to determine the answer to the question. The smallest products between factor pairs are:\n\n5*5 = 25\n5*25 = 125\n5*125 = 625\n\nThe highest product can be compared with a product that is less than 125, which shows that 25 is the choice with the highest product. The only set of factor pairs that equals this number is 1*50, therefore the factor pairs are not a factor pair for number 104. Therefore, the answer 102 has the fewest product pairs which equals the fewest factor pairs.\n\nInput: An apple tree had two pear trees, how many pears do you think it will have if you double the number of pear trees?

{"idx": 451, "text": "1) Given the context, we need to find out how many more gallons of milk Flora must drink on a daily basis to get sufficient calcium into her body to heal her frequent bone fractures. \n2) A gallon of milk equals to 3.75 liters. So, 105 gallon of milk equals 362,5 liters. \n3) For someone to get sufficient calcium amounts on a daily basis, they would typically need to drink at least 1000 milligrams, and some cases even up to 1500mg on a daily basis. \n4) In this scenario, let's assume that the gallons of milk Flora has to drink daily are equivalent to the amount to fulfill the requirement needed by 1000 mg of calcium. \n5) At 1000mg, Flora might need to drink 0.375 gallons (375ml / 1000) to fulfill her daily calcium needs. \n6) Therefore, Flora cannot drink 3 gallons of milks on a daily basis and fulfill the gallon requirement to get the calcium needed for a day's intake - which means she must drink more than 3 gallons.\n7) Therefore, Flora has to drink more than 3 gal(lons). Of course, the question does not explicitly specify how many gallons extra she needs to drink, we can make an assumption that she will need to drink the same quantity as the excess required for her to be able to fulfill 1000+1000 mgs of calcium on a daily basis. This means that she will need to increase her daily intake from 3 to 6 \u2013 10 gallons of milk. \nSo the final answer to the question:\nTo fulfill Dr. Juan's requirement, how many gallons must Flora drink more to achieve the calcium needed on a daily basis?\nis: 6 - 10 gallons from 3 gallons a day.\n\nInput: A litter of puppies has an astounding number of teeth.

The context of the question is that Mark is using his sick/vacay days in equal proportions. \n3. The question first asks about using half of his sick days and half of his vacation days. So this means that after each day use, he should have 2 days left.\n4. So each week, after 2 use days, he'd have 6 days left.\n5. 8 hours constitute 1 working day. 10 of them = 80 hours, 14 times over a 5 day week.\n5. After 3 week use of sick/vacay, he'd have spent 100 days. That is 800 hours or 80 working hours.\n6. The final answer is 80 working hours or 3.75 working days.\nSo the final answewr is 3.75 workings days\n\nInput: Where is the water in a swimming pool? Choices: 1. A: ocean B: river C: mountain D: valley E: sky\nOutput: The question asks where water is typically found in a swimming pool.\n1. One interpretation of the phrase 'in a swimming pool' is that the water is contained within a pool and is not part of an extended body of water.\n2. A pool of water that is intended for swimming in generally has less water than that of a pool or tank intended for storage or manufacturing purposes.\n3. Furthermore, the question asks specifically about 'water in a pool'. Water can obviously be found in tanks or ponds which are not considered to be pools. Therefore, pool must refer to a swimming pool specifically.\n4. The choices: ocean, river, and sky seem to be unlikely places for water to reside in a poool, as these are typically not confined areas.\n5. The choices: mountain and valley refer to specific geographical land masses which would also be likely to contain considerable volumes of water not suited the purposes of a swimming pool. A valley may in fact contain a river or a floodwater basin which might be found in a pool. A mountain could have large quantities", "answer": " 80"}
{"idx": 468, "text": "1: The question is asking for the total distance, in miles, that Hadley walked in his boots.\n2. Our aim in this question is to calculate the total distance, in mile, that Hadley walked to the grocery, pet store and back home.\n3. As we are only given 3 pieces of information, we can make an assumption that the total distance walked was 3.\n4. Considering that the only constant in the question is the walking distance, we can eliminate 2, and proceed to find the 2nd distance in the question.\n5. The 2nd distance is said to be one less than two miles and this can be represented by the number (2-1) which can be represented by x (as we are looking for the distance in miles).\n6. Now that we have x, it seems reasonable to assume that the answer to the question is (4-x), which can be represented by another number y.\n7. The final distance must be (2+x+y) miles. The answer to this question is then (2+x+4-x) miles, or (6+x) miles. \n8. We can simplify this equation by writing: 3+y \n9. After simplifying, we have y = 3 which gives us a answer of (6+3) miles = 9 miles in total.\nSo the final distance is 9 miles.\n\nInput: What would you put on a pie?

The question asks the shopping center the payment amount for 6 T-shirts, 4 sweaters, and 5 jackets.\n2.The total amount that Kevin has to pay is shown in the option F and should be calculated through the following steps.\n3. First, we need to find out the total cost of each item (including sales tax). For T-shirts : $ ( 8 X number of T-Shirts) = $64 + 5% = $66, and for jackets : $ (80 X Jackets to buy) = $800 + 5% = 810\n4. For each item, the total cost after sales tax is also calculated by taking the total cost of each and adding 5% of that total. For T-shirrt : $ ( $64) = $64, and for jackets: $ ( $810) = $840.\n5. Therefore, combining the last two, the total cost of all items becomes : $ (64 + 66 + 810 + 840) = 2140\n6. Next, the total cost must be divided by the total number of items in order to get the total cost for each individual item.\n7. 2140/ 6 = $356. \n8. To calculate the total cost for each item, we need the total number of items.\n9. This is calculated by dividing 6: $6.00 x 6 = $36.00\n10. Adding the total cost of each individual item ( $10 X 6 ) and the total cost for each particular item ( $356), the total amount to be paid is shown in option F : $ (10 X 6) + 356 = $364\nSo the final answer the payment amount for all items, as calculated by option F as :$364", "answer": " 504"}

{"idx": 471, "text": "1) We first need to think about how Gary is supposed to get the total pay, if we assume he works for 6 days straight, he will get 6*12 = 72. This is incorrect because it includes the Sunday (7th day) (Gary can see his pay stub, which should have 6 days, so he would be paid 6*12=72, not the 700 he got). Note that this would also result in Gary working 92 hours in a single week, which doesn't really make sense. 2) At this point we can assume that his total pay comes out to $700, and so we calculate the amount of pay earned with extra pay $696.00 - $12.00 = $684.00\n3) How many shifts does Gary work each week? At this point it is not necessary to count how many days Gary works every week, but it is necessary to know how much he is paid per shift. We can use the formula (shift Hours * Pay Per Shift)/700 = Overtime Hours\nshiftHours*payPerShift/720 = overtimeHours 4) Once we have the formula we can solve it using basic math, we know both shift hours, pay per shift, and total pay (this is done as follows: ((700-12)$696)*4$8=$1200). This allows us to find the overtime hours 96*$8=$768), this is our final step as this is our total overtime hours.\n5) Next we get the total hours worked\n96+768=$864, which is the value we wanted.\n\nInput: Which of the following animals is not a member of the primatae primates?

{"idx": 486, "text": "1.In this question, we are given some information about the number of hours worked by Lance and his hourly wage. Our task is to find out how much money Lance makes for the week, assuming that he works no holiday schedule.\n2.Step 1: Identify the Key TermsIn the questions above, the key term is the highlighted word that indicates the direction of the question. For example, when asked, \"Where is the nearest bank branch?\" the key term is \"bank\". \n3.Step 2: Restate the Key TermThe key terms are phrased in the negative to show the desired outcome, as in our example answer (A: own home). The question's key terms are restated as statements. For example: \"I want to make a payment of $50 to my mortgage at the bank\".\n4.Step 3: Identify Possible Choice Answer PairsThe question always asks which of two or more answer choices is the best choice. For example: \"Where can one donate old clothes?\" The correct answer is \"H: own home\" as the other options (A: \"banks\" and C: \"clubs\") already have the phrasing of the key term (A: \"clubs\" and B: \"bank\" respectively). We can eliminate options that contradict the phrasing of the question and eliminate any answer choice that is not a rephrasing of the key term.\n5.Step 4: Find an Answer Choice that Meets the Conditions of the Key TermFrom the remaining options, choose the answer choice that most closely matches the wording of the key term while remaining as vague as possible.[4] To get more practice using the wording of the question to determine the intended answer, try choosing an answer choice that is the opposite of the key terms. For example, for the question of how to get to the nearest city from your current location, choose the answer \"the nearest city is not a city\" instead of \"the nearest city is a city\".\n6.Step 5: Answer Option ConfirmationIn order to confirm your answer, you should eliminate all answer choices except for one that closely matches the wording (and, when possible, the meaning) of the key phrase. \n\nInput: How do you get a job to begin with?

The total contributions for the party is therefore ($5,000-$500) = $4,500.\n5. To simplify this, let's assume that $4,50,000 is in its simplest terms, $4,50.\n6. Subtracting $4,50 from $5,500, the total remaining is $1,000, because $500 is subtracted from both sides.\n7.

{"idx": 502, "text": "The question asks how many weeks it will take John to go from wall push-ups to floor push-ups after working up to it.\n1. To answer this question we must first consider the difficulty of push-ups between each other and how many reps John would need to add a day to reach a new challenge.\n2. Lets start by eliminating some of the choices. For example if we eliminate F: 6 weeks, we can see John starts with wall push-up and adds one rep a day. Wall push-ups would require multiple body parts to be used and John may be too unfit to even engage the wall.\n3. Lets also eliminate E: 13 weeks, as floor push-ups are harder than wall push-ups.\n4. The choices A: 1 or B: 2 can be eliminated as John does not start with 0 push-ups, he starts with doing wall push-ups. If he starts with wall push-umps he must have been doing them before.\n5. We can take the 15 reps and use that as 1/2 of the number he would have added if he was going backwards, to work up the the previous challenge.  So if he went from 3 to 7 in 1 training, John will be adding 3.5 reps per day to get back to the 7 push-ups he could do previously.\n6. We also can consider that John has decided to work a push-up a day for 5 days a week.\n7. Considering that he will work his highest push-up for the final challenge, John will do 25 wall push-ups x 5 days a week = 125 push-ups per week. He will not get to his highest challenge in 1 week, because if the push-ups were 15 he would have reached the 3 training by the end of the first week.\n8. So John will need to work at his highest push-ups for 4 weeks, which means it will take 4 weeks to reach floor push-ups.\nSo the final result is 4. Floor push-ups are the answer.", "answer": " 9"}

Yasna is to read an equal number of pages every day, but her goal is to finish two books in total by the end of the two weeks.\nThis means Yasna reads all 180 pages of the first book in the first week and all 100 pages of the first in the second week.\nAs Yasna is to finish two books, the second book she is to finish should include pages she has not covered yet. This means Yasna should have cover 100 pages in the first week and 100 pages from the second.\nThis means each day should be 100 pages, or 50 pages per week. The daily read rate is 50 pages per day.\nThe total number, if the total pages from both books is 280, means the daily read rate is 30 pages per day.

Based on this, the most likely reaction would be to attack (c) or flee (b). Choices (a), (d), and (e) do not seem to be the most likely reactions, as the context suggests an immediate and strong reaction.\n3: Choice b seems to be the best fit in context, even though it is not stated in the scenario, as the animal fleeing immediately suggests that it needs to flee as fast as it can, which is what we can reasonably expect when startled by something dangerous.\n4: Considering the options'stay where it started from', 'take cover', 'attempt to attack' and'stop suddenly', these do not appear to make much sense in the context provided, as they do not seem to be appropriate behaviors for a large animal startled by something dangerous, and they do not appear to be typical.\n5: Choice a ('stay where it started') seems the least likely in context, as we were not told it was startled by something dangerous or dangerous to it, which would suggest it would be more likely to stay and watch as it was startled, or to continue whatever activity it was doing if no danger was likely.\n\nInput: The number of times to complete a task is the amount of time it should take to do the task.

The temperature does not affect the likelihood of going into a skid in the first place, so we treat that as a constant.

{"idx": 524, "text": "1: This is asking how many pods Hayes will need for a full year's worth of laundry.\n2: To answer this question, it is necessary to determine how many loads of laundry Hayes does in a year.\n3: Considering that he does exactly 3 loads per week, we can say that he does 156 loads (3x12x3x52) in a year.\n4: If we multiply the number of loads he does in a year by the number of pods per load (3), we get the number of pods (4,688).\n5: From here, we can work out that he will need ~50 packs of pods for a full year' s worth of laundry (4688/39=121). This means that his estimate was quite accurate as even if he used all the 4688 pods in a year, it would only be off by 5%.\nSo the final answer for the question \"Input:Hayes's pods come 32 to a pack.

The remainder (which is the remainder we get after dividing a large number into a small number) = 6, so each person gets about 6 cookies. \n4) Since 63 pieces of each candies divided by 7 has a remainder of 0 (which means you can finish with the left over number of each candy that each person wants) =, the person will get about 9 pieces of each of the 2 desserts. \n5) Adding this to the 6 desserts of the cakes = 15 cookies per person and if there were 21 brownies each person would get 1.3 (about 13/12) brownies each. \n6) When all of this is said and done, each person gets 59 cookies, 15 brownies, and 9 pieces of candy.\nSo the final answers to the question is:\na) 0.65 cookies per person\nb) 0.60 brownies per person\nc) 0.25 candy per person\n\nInput: 1/6\nOutput: 1: The question is asking for the value of 1/6, which is easy to figure out using the formula 1/6=0.167, just multiply 1 by 0.167.\n2: The question is asking how to find 1/6 using a calculator.\n3: To do this, you start by setting your calculator to scientific mode (use the \"2nd\" or \"ST\" key if possible)\n4: Next, use the 2nd key for division, set it so it reads \"1/6,\"\n5: Press the equal sign key \"=\", and you'll get your answer.", "answer": " 18"}

To determine how many people voted on the witch cake compared to the dragon cake, we can subtract the number of votes for each cake from the total number of votes.\n3. If 7 people had voted for the witch, subtracting the number of voters from the top cake by 7 and multiplying the lower cake by 7 will tell us how many more people voted for that cake.\n4. In this case, we know the number of total votes was 369, so we can subtract the number for each cake from it and multiply the difference by 7 respectively.\n5. The number of votes for the unicorn would equal 369 - 79, or 290.\n6. Then the number of votes for a dragon would equal 362 - 27, or 335.\n7. Dividing the number of votes for one cake by the number of votes for another yields the ratio of their votes. \n8.

A 30-inch diameter mixer means that its radius is 15 inches and circumference is 45 inches. We are looking for the diameter of each individual mixing bowl that fills from the mixer. Therefore, we need to subtract the diameter of the mixing bowl from 30 to find the diameter of the bowl. Thus 15-(30-15)=12.

Then, one has to set up a system to calculate cars parked based on such given inputs.\n3) Given 400' x 500' (total area which is 400x500 = total area = 200000 sq. ft. = 1977600 sq. in.) only 80% of the lot is useable (percentage to be used for parking) 10 sq. ft. is to park cars. To answer this, one should divide a large parking lot size like 400' into 10 ft. intervals by using tape or chalk.\n4) For all such 10 ft. divisions, if the total of the area in such 10 ft division is less than 10, that division will not be parking and its area will remain as part of the common area.\n5) Then, the area for parking gets counted where ever the total of area in that 10 ft. division is greater than 10.\n6) This whole system is repeated for all the 10 ft. per each 10% divisions.\n7) Note: After calculating the area for parking, a percentage is not to be considered again because we are not changing another percentage. Instead, the area for parks gets to be the area to be multiplied to get number of parking cars.\n8) For example, If a division from 200' to 299' does not contain 10 sq. foot each, the 10 ft section will come in to the common areas. That means only 2000 - 10x10 = 200 sq. foot of parking lot space is useable.

{"idx": 565, "text": "Rodney has $35 more than Ian, while Ian has half as much as Jessica. Jessica, on the other hand, only has $100. \nThis means that Rodney is able to save more money, as he has $35 left over after giving half of his $35 to Ian, than Jessica, who has $100 left after giving half of her $100 to Ian. \nRodney has $70 more than the combined total of Ian's and Jessica's money. This means that Jessica has $30 more than her combined total (Rodney's and Ian's). \nHowever, if Rodney would also give Jessica half of her $130, how much money would Jessica have, and how much money would be left for Ian? \nSolution:From the data, we can see that Rodney has $35 dollars more than his initial sum of $35, and Ian has $17.50 dollars less than the combined total of $35 and $35. Jessica has $100 dollars, which accounts for being the total of Rodney's $35 plus Ian's $17.5. \nTo add to that, Ian is only able to save half as much as Jess, after Rodney makes a gift to him. This means that he only has $40 for his own savings (Rodney' s $35 and Ian's other $5). \nTherefore, Rodney has $75.5 (75.5 = (17.5+$35)) more than the combined total, Jess has $34 (34 = $100*(1/2)), Ian has $43.5 (43.5 = Rodney's $40 $100) more than the combined total. \nThis suggests that Rodney can afford to save more because he has saved the most amount.

The context of the scenario is clear - that both of them ran the 12 mile race. \n3. The solution to this question lies in finding the distance between running 8 miles and running 12 miles.\n4. One method to do this is to subtract 8 from 12 and solve for the answer of 4, which is the distance between 12 and 8.\n5. Another method is to divide 12 miles into the total of 8 miles + 12 miles and multiply by 100 (since we're talking about miles).\n6. 8 miles + 8 miles = 16 miles,\n7. 16/24 of 16 equals -8,\n8. or 4\n9. 4 x 100=400\n10.

So we start by eliminate the option for which Chris and Wilson had names. Hence we are left with option 5: 2 boys had names Chris Wilson. \n2: When a teacher calls out to 10 students and says all the names, the total number of students must be 10 students. Given that there were 2 names Chris Wilson in the total 10 students, 2 are the number of boys named Chris Wilson and 10 is total number of students, which means there are 8 remaining students who names were Chris Wilson since only 2 have that name. \n3: There are 6 students who had different names other than Chris Wilson. So 2 was of male Chris Wilson name and 6 were of different names. Hence we have 8 students have names other than Chris Wilson in the total of 10 students, the male Chris Wilson are among the remaining 8 students since there are 2 Chris Wilson in total 10 students.

We first need to find a common factor amongst all of the given answers. The only thing that the given answers have in common is that they all end in \"8\". We therefore need to find a divisor common to all of these numbers. We start by cross multiplying the numbers by each other. This gives us:\n\n$ (3*5) = 125 $ \n$ (6*7) = 218 $\n$ (8*7) = 56 $ \n$ (8*8) = 64 $\n$ (8+1) = 9 $\n$ (8-8) = 0 $\n\n$ (2*6) = 12 $   \n$ (3*6) = 21 $  \n$ (3*7) = 17 $  \n   $ (4*9) = 192 $  \n\n2. Next, we see that one of the answers must be $192$. This is because we can either select $192$ as our common divisor and then divide by it to get smaller answers as it is the highest of the given numbers.\n3. We then have the following: $ (3_5)+(2_6)+(1_7) $ which means $ (3*5+2*6+1*7) $ which when solved $ = (3*5+5*6+3*7) $\n4. Multiplying the last two numbers together, we get: $ (3*5*6*7) $ which is $2312 $. However $13*2310 = (8*3)*2310 $. This shows us that the answer is $", "answer": " 3240"}

{"idx": 607, "text": "1: The question asks how many marbles in the big box are of a different color than red marbles.\n2: It is important to focus on the specific instruction \"total of all marbles in big box\" as this is the total amount mentioned in the question. Also, the instructions tell us that there are \"two thousand and ninety-six\" marbles of all four colours in the big box. Let's denote that as \"M\". \n3: We now need to find the number of marbles in the same color as red marbles by subtracting the number of red marbles from \"Total of all marbles in box\". Denote this as \"N\". \n4: So, based on the numbers of marbles of each color being known, the question asks:\n\nN= Total of Marbles in Box - Total of Red Marbles\n\nN = M - 20* Red Marbles\n\n5: In order to determine how many marbles of a different color there are, we need to multiply the number of marbles of a different colour, M - 20 * Red Marbles, by 3 as the original context stated three times more than green marbles. \n\nN*3 = M - 2* Red Marbles (Since M - 2*red marbles = N, M - (2*20*Red Marbles))\n\nN*3=M - (40*Red Marbles)\n\nN=M - (4*4*Red Marbles) = M - (16*Red Marbles) \n\n6: Finally, we have to subtract the number of red marble from the number of total marbles to get the remaining marbles of a different colours i.e. 4000 - (16*20) = (4000 - 320) = 2980\n\nSo the answer is M - 320 = 2982, or 2982 marbles.\nSo the final calculation is: \"2000 and ninety six\" marbles. So the final answer is 2982\n\nInput: If there isn't much time, I don't have time. A. Choices:  A. Where do people go to be alone? B. 1. Where do people usually go? 2.", "answer": " 88"}

The question also asks about the number of more tokens each sibling will have as compared to her sibling.\n4.) Each sibling is given half of whatever Sandy will not receive after selling half of the tokens. 5.) After half of Sandy's tokens are given to her siblings, her total tokens left = 550, 000.\n6.) For each sibling, we subtract their portion of Sandy's remaining tokens from Sandy's total, i.e., \n7.) Each sibling has 550,100- 225,000 = 325,100 tokens.\n8.) Therefore, after splitting up the number of tokens among her siblings, Sandy has at least 3 more tokens than each one of her siblings.\nSo the final value is 3.\n\nInput: I see a cloud that is in the shape of an amoeba.

{"idx": 613, "text": "Ali has 125 total bottle caps, 50 of which are red. He has green caps as well, but he has not indicated what the ratio is between the red and green caps he has. Since Ali has more red caps than he has green caps, we can conclude that the ratio of red caps to green caps that he has is lower than 2:1.\nOption A: 16.7%: This answer only works if Ali has more green caps than red caps. Since we already established that the ratio between red and green caps would be lower than 2: 1, this answer cannot be correct.\nOption B: 16 percent:\nOne way to solve this question is by using the ratio 125:50 to determine the number of bottle caps Ali has for each. The two bottle caps he has in his possession is 0.083333 or 8.3333 percent. \nWe can plug this into an equation to find the number of green bottle caps Ali has: B = 0.125*0.83333 = 0.010179 or 1.0179 percent. \nWe repeat this process for the red bottle caps, knowing that they make up 1 - 0.082 = 0.9179 percent of his caps. \nSo the green bottle caps make up 0.017932 percent, and the red bottle caps make up the remaining 0.902068 percent.

This is because mice are small, and cats lack the ability to see small things.\n2. It is not likely that the cat sees anything other than what it can see from its position.\n3. Because the question is asking for what the cat most likely does not see, any statement that is false is a probable answer.\n4.

{"idx": 630, "text": "1440 is the answer 1. The problem has been posed in the form of a story, where a teacher works for 6 months and is paid $5 for each periodic day, totalling $1440.\n2. The first step is to represent the problem in mathematical terms.\n3. The total number of days worked by the teacher  is represented by the symbol: n. Here n represents 6 months in this example.\n4. The total number of monetary equivalent of the work given by n is represented by the symbol M.\n5. So, in the problem, we are given the total number of days the teacher works and the amount he earns for each day.\n6. So, to calculate the total number of days or the total monetary equivalent, we can use the formulas:\nM = n * $5\nM = n * 5\n\n7. So, for the equation with respect to n:\nn = 6\n5n = 30\n\n8. For the equation with respect to M:\nM = 5n\nM = 300\n9. Substituting 5n for M:\n5n = 1440\n10. To solve 5n = 1540  for n:\n5n/n = 6  (multiply each side of the equation with 5 to eliminate n)\n5 = 30\n11. To solve n = 30/5, we multiply both sides by n to cancel the denominator:\n5n =1440\n6n = 240\n12. Now, to find n:\nn = (6n)/6\nn = (6/6)*6\n13. Hence the answer to the question is n = 30 days in 6 months or M = 144 periods in 6 months or 1440 days in 6months.\nSo the final solution comes out to be M = $720", "answer": " 3600"}

{"idx": 634, "text": "1) The question is asking what the combined shoe size is for Jasmine (7) and her older sister Alexia (14). \n2) Alexia is significantly taller and older than Jasmine, which leads us to know that her shoe size must be considerably larger. \n3) It's unlikely that Jasmine purchases shoes that are twice as big as her own, which would be an absurd decision to make. This eliminates the original premise of the question, where Alexia's shoes are the double the size of Jasmine's. \n4) To resolve this, let us think of the size comparison in a different way. If Jasmine buys shoes which are double the size of her own, then it's safe to assume that her shoe size is also the same as Alexia's shoe size. Otherwise, the shoes she buys would be the double of what she owns. \n5) If Jasmine and Alexia both have the same shoe size, they must buy the same number of shoes. Therefore, each of them is also equal to a shoe size of 14. \n6) The combined shoe size therefore must be 28, the sum of both Jasmine's and Alexia's shifts. \n7) Therefore, the final answer is 14 + 14 = 28. \nSo the final answer 28\n\nInput: Why were we allowed to eat all three flavors of cake?

We also know from the question that dinner will be ready at 17:30. This gives us a time frame of 17:35 to 17:45 to finish the cleaning job, leaving us with a window of 10 to 15 minutes, not accounting for the time to prepare dinner. \n4) Looking at the list of information, here is a summary of the tasks at hand: \na. Tina has estimated that it will take her 3 minutes to clean a stuck keyboard key. This means 15 stuck keys will take her a total of 45 minutes. \nb. There are 15 stuck keys to be cleaned.

You should make sure to cover all the material on the test, understand it, and be able to apply it to different types of questions. Take quizzes and practice tests to try different types of questions, and ask your teacher for help if you don\u2019t understand something.\n\nNext, you should take as many practice tests and quizzes as possible leading up to the AP Statistics test. This will allow you to identify patterns in the types of questions you\u2019re asked and be prepared for them when test day arrives. It will also help give you a sense of how much material you\u2019ve mastered and how much you still need to work on.\n\nFinally, you should get a good night's sleep before the test.", "answer": " 8"}

{"idx": 653, "text": "1. The question is about finding how many boxes of crackers Tanika sold over the course of two days.\n2. We can split the question into two phrases. Over the two days: On Saturday, how many boxes? Sunday, Tanika sold 50%+ the number of boxes she sold on Saturday = _ how many boxes? 3. On Saturday, Tanika sold 60 boxes, so if she was going to sell 50%+ it means she needs to sell 50 boxes on Sunday.\n4. On Sunday, Tanika did not sell 50 boxes, but on top of that, she sold 65 boxes on top of that. Let's convert 50 boxes, which is what she sold on Sunday into a percentage. Then take 65 the amount of boxes she sold. Now take the percentage and multiply by the amount she sold on Saturday of 60. 5. In mathematics, 50% means half. To get that percentage we divide 50 by 2 and that way we get 0.5 or 50% so we write that: 50%=0.556=5,6% 6. Then we multiply it with the number of boxes that Tanika sold on Saturday but she sold 60 so 0.556*60=33.04 which is 33 and 54 so we write three thirty five so 33.5 which is 33%\n7. Since Tanika sold 33%=33/100%  of the boxes she sold on Saturday then she sold a total of: 60+33.5 boxes.\nSo the final outcome should be Tanika sold a total of seventy three boxes. 73 boxes", "answer": " 150"}

To compute the expected travel time from his home to the train station, Pete could calculate half of the total expected travel time.\n4. Half of 10 minutes would be 5 minutes, plus he would need to add 20 minutes if he arrives at the train station 20 minutes later than scheduled.\n5.

This can be eliminated because this also cannot be true because how could anyone hold 5 times more than another when they only hold enough money for 5 times more and together they only have $150? Thus: option $70 is eliminated\n5.Choice D: Jackson has $55. This is a possibility because according to the question $70 would not be a good choice given the same reason. The only reason we could go with this would be because we have to choose between a lot of different choices. However, there is a better choice in the question.\n6.Choice E: Jackson has $50. This might be a good choice because it could be true due to their having $5 more together and also the same logic and question as with their have $75 and $70 could not be possible reasons for the same logic as the question in the above choices and this choice has $5 more then $70 and $75 does and this choice fits all the rules as per the question.\n7.Therefore the correct answer is E: Jackson has $105\nSo the final answer in dollars is E: Jackson has 105\n\n### Input: How do you clean a whiteboard effectively?

If Andy wins both of his lawsuited then he doesn't lose them. So, his probability of winning one of the lawsuits is equal to 1 -probability of winning the other.( 1 - (1/2 * 1/2 ) = 1/4 in this case)\nThen probability of losing one and winning the other is same as losing both of them.\nIf Andy loses both law suit then this case will have a probability of winning one of them to be 1/2.\nSimilarly, probability that Andy wins both of his the lawsuits( 1/4* 1/4 = 1/16) Then Andy loses both of his lawsuit. In this situation, the probability that he wins both of them, the probability that he loses both of them, and the probability that he neither wins nor loses both of them are then all equal to 1/16.

It is given that Cecil has $60, Catherine has $25 less than twice the amount of Cecil ($175), and that Carmela has $80 more than twice the amount of Cesil ($150).\n3. We can begin by considering the difference between 2 times the number of money the first person has ($600) and twice the number the second person has. \n4. To get the difference, we can subtract 2 times the second person's amount($1200) from $2400. \n5.

The Audio books must be purchased in three days to save $55 and the Audio books are discounted 15% after being purchased in 3 days.

The Uber ride downton costs $22. Therefore, $22-$16 = $6 is saved if Trevor takes an Uber instead of a Lyft.\n4. $22 minus the uber ride cost is $16. Therefore, Trevor is going to have to pay $6 extra.\n5. A lyft ride dowtown at $1 is cheaper than a taxi. \n6.

This is done by considering that a farmer is allowed to keep at most two chicken per 4 square feet, and they bought 7 ducks. From this information, we can infer that the number of square feet that can be utilised by a single chicken, as each chicken takes up 4 square feet, is 16 square feet per chicken.\n3.

Choices: A: It will become heavier. B: Heavier. C: Nothing. D: Lighter. E: It will stay the same.\nOutput: \n1. The question is trying to understand the behavior of a metal plate when it is subjected to heat, and we are asked to identify the correct statement about the plate's properties before and after it heats up.\n2. The properties of the metal are being altered by the exposure to heat, and we need to consider the possible changes in each option.\n3. Let's begin by ruling out option C: Nothing, as this suggests that the plate will remain the same after heating up, which is not the case.\n4. Also, we can eliminate option B: Heavier, because while increasing temperature can cause some metals to contract or shrink, other metals tend to expand. Neither statement seems true.\n5. Option D: Lighter is also incorrect, as it is unlikely that heating up could make metal lighter.\n6. That leaves two options to consider: A: It will get heavier and E: It will stay as they were. \n7. However, since option A: It will get Heavier is the one that best describes the property of the metal before and after heating, this answer is incorrect.\n8.

{"idx": 724, "text": "1. The question is about John's eating habits. \n2. The first thing to note is that \"after dinner\" does not indicate how much time passed in the past. It could happen the same night or the next day. So, for instance, if John eats a bag of chip and then eats \"thrice as many\" \"after dinner\" on the next day, it is still true that he ate \"twice as many\" \"after\" dinner.\"\n3. \"Twice as many\" means that John ate two bags of chips \"after dinner.\" \n4. By the time \"after dinner\" occurred, he had already eaten one bag of chips. Therefore, the correct number of bags John ate is A: 2 because he consumed 2 bags of chips after dinner and he ate 1 before dinner.\nSo the final result is A: 2\n\nInput: Do they have cats at the zoo? \nOutput:  1: The question asks if pets (specifically cats) live in the place where there are animals for display to visitors (specifically a zoo). \n2.

{"idx": 730, "text": "1.`Input 1.\n1. The question is about John and his dog and the time and distance they can run together or separately. \n2. First, we examine the question and identify the necessary values and their units (miles/minutes): \n4 mph (running alone) = 4 miles/hour = 2 miles/minute 6 mph (running with dog) = 6 miles/hour = 3 miles/minute 30 min together = 30 min x 60 sec/min = 1800 sec = 30 min 30 min alone = 30 min = 180 sec =.5 hr \n3. In light of this, we can begin by eliminating options based on obvious discrepancies with the question and our values. \n4. Option A: 2 miles is clearly incorrect as 2 miles/min is not the same as 2 miles/ hr. \n5. Options B and C: both mention minutes on their own; however, as stated above, the question asks for miles. \n6. Option E:.5 hr is a fraction of an hour and does not match the other time values in the question: 30 min together and 30 min alone.\n7. Therefore, we are left with options D: 5 miles and B: 5 miles. \n8. Our values for miles/minute are based on John's speed when he runs alone vs. his speed while being pulled by his dog. However, we are looking for John's total distance when being pulled by his dog for 30 min. As a result, John's speed at any given moment does not matter, so we simply focus on adding 2 miles to the 3 miles already added by the dog.

I came upon a dead oak tree that split into several stumps. I sat down in an awkward position, using the stump as a backrest. The stump was rough and uneven, and the bark was a little loose from the cold winter weather. It felt great. I noticed the leaves of a nearby tree and thought about how quickly they were falling off the branches. The wind was quite strong that day, and I could hear it whistling through the trees. I heard a rustle behind me, and I turned to see a lizard, moving so fast that its movements only made a slight rustle. I got up, and the forest felt silent again. I wondered if I had just imagined the sound I heard, but then I thought of how fast the lizard had been moving. It had been moving much faster than I would have been able to hear. I realized that I must have made the sound of the leaves rustling. It sounds silly, but it was really fascinating to me.

If they can keep bouncing the ball, it will never stop. (Note: This is not always true. Sometimes, you have to catch the ball before starting on a new round).\n3 The goal of hacky sack is to get the ball to go as high as possible to their leg, as they may never stop bouncing.\n4. In a hacky sack game, there is a time limit, so one must complete the round by catching the ball. The players can try to bounce as high as they can up to and including the time limit.\n5. In a way, this is also one of the reasons to play, apart from it being a fun game, so, one can aim to bounce the highest.", "answer": " 1500"}

A: get a map and plot my route B: take a road trip C: take public transportation D: pack E: book a hotel\nOutput: 1.: the question is asking for what people most often do first when making plans for a trip.\n2. To start answering this question, we can consider the actions that are typically the first steps when making plans for a journey. \n3. This means we will need to eliminate options that are not likely to be the very first thing people do when planning a trip.\n4. The words \"making plans\" in the prompt suggest that the action we are looking for will involve creating a plan. \n5. Therefore, option A, \"get a map and plot my (t) route,\" can be eliminated as making a plan typically involves more than getting a map and route. \n6. We can also eliminate choice C, \"take a (p) road trip,\" as many people may prefer public transportation over driving or would plan to drive without having a road map. \n7. Similarly, option D, \"take public transportation,\" can also be eliminated as people might want to drive to the destination or may have other means of transportation. \n8. This leaves us with options E, \"pack\" and B, \"book a hotel.\" \n9. Option E is somewhat specific and less general than the other choices. \n10. Hence, choice B, \"book a (h) hotel,\" is the correct answer, as booking hotels", "answer": " 9"}

How many miles did he travel?\n2) Swimming and running are activities that take up time and can be measured using time and distance.\n3) With Tom swimming for 1 hour at 1 mile per hour, we can say that he covers 1 mile and the time in hours is 1. \n4) Running for half the time at speed 2, means that the speed for running half the time is 4 times the speed or 8.00 mph. This means he covers 8.00 miles in running for half the time \n5) Summing both the time and distance in the run, we can say that Tom covers 9.00 miles.\n6) Using our answer we can answer the question Tom swims for 1 hours at 1 mile per hours.

But if 5 out of 10 were on the rafter excusion, it means that 5 out of 30 (as 10 is lesser than 40) were on the raft. Hence, since only 6 went tubing, 5/30 out of the remaining 60 can be assumed to be on the tubing excusion.\n5. And that gives us an answer of 5 kikkos that were on both the rafting as well as tubing excusions. (1/3) * 10 = 5.\n\nInput: In which direction did the sun move away?  Choices:  A. Southeast B.

{"idx": 778, "text": "1, It is clear from the question that we will use a formula or a method to get the answer to this question. \n2. First, it is important to determine a variable to represent the amount of money spent. Let\u2019s represent this with the variable \u201cMoney\u201d, where Money equals the money spent by Mara and Riley.\n3. The next step is to state the given information in the question in terms of this variable. Since Mara rode a bumper car twice and a Ferris wheel three times, we will use these values to determine how much money she spent. We can rewrite this information as:\n$$Money = 2*2 + 3*5 = 10 + 15 = 25$$\n4. Similarly, Riley rode a space shuttle four time and a Ferris wheel 3 times, so we can write this information as: \n$$\u200bMoney = 4*4 + 3*5= 16 + 15 =21$$\nTherefore, the equation we are looking for is: Money = 25 + 21.\n5. To solve for Money, we can plug the known values in for x and use algebra to solve for it. We will start by multiplying both sides by 29 to eliminate fractions: \n$$25 + 29 = 54$$\n6. There are now two ways to solve this equation, but when doing algebra, it is important to be consistent with the operations used. In this case, the equation must be equal to zero, so we use a subtraction to get there: \n$$29 \u2013 (25 + 24) = 0 $$\n7. Now substitute our two values into each side to solve for x: \n$$2*4 \u2013 (3*5) = 0$$\n8. There are now only three values that can give 0, which are zero plus any number, zero minus any number, and 1. The only other options are negative numbers, and we have been consistently asked to give positive answers, so we will eliminate negative numbers:\n\n$$0 + (X + 5) = 0\\text{ or }0 \u2013 (X + 5)= 0$$\n9, To simplify our equation, we will add the negative and positive sides and then divide by two, thus", "answer": " 50"}

So, one ream of paper contains one complete short story (~500 printed sheets) and one-twelfth of a novel (~80 printed sheets).\n5) Since John writes 50 short-stories and one novel in a month, that means he uses one complete ream per week (~500 sheets per month = 500 \u00f7 4 = 124.286 + 12/12) or 12.5 reams per month, 150 reams per year.\n6) Now consider the length of the novel.

{"idx": 791, "text": "1. The question is about getting the area/dimensions of the triangle that is drawn at the base having measure 40 cm and height 20 cm.\n2. It is known that: Area = 1/2 * B * H\n3. A triangle has the shape of a trapezium if we consider a horizontal line on the base that is drawn at the top of 40 cm.\n4. So the horizontal line drawn at the top must be parallel to the height of 20 cm and thus we get a trapezium.\n5. The base of the trapezium must be 20 cm. \n6. Therefore, by definition of trapezium the diagonal of a trapezium is equal to sum of length of any two opposite sides of the trapezium.\n7. Hence, the area of the trapezium is equal 1/2 * 20 * (height of 20 cm).\n8. So the total area for the triangular-shaped houses that Zion and two of his friends made will be 2/3 * 800.\nSo the final final answer is 2/3 *800 \n\nInput: A person that has a habit of forgetting names could easily confuse a person who they know well.

Therefore, we can eliminate options A, C, and D for now.\n9 Next, we can eliminate options B for Julie and E for Carlos. These options are not possible because Julie and Carlos caught half of what Tabitha caught. \n10 If they had caught double what Tabitha caught, then Tabitha would not have caught half the amount and that would result in double of what she caught. Therefore, from the options we are left with two possible scenarios; \n11 If Tabitha caught 10 pieces, then Stan and Julie would only have caught 13 and 10 respectively, which leaves Carlos with 22, as 1/2 of the total of 10.\n12 If Tabitha caught zero candy, then Stan, Julie, and Carlos would have caught 22, 13, and 13 respectively, leaving 21 candy for Tabitha.\n13 We can eliminate option E for Carlos because it would be impossible for him to catch the candy if the other friends caught double of what Tabitha did and Carlos caught half of that.\n14 Therefore, for option B and C, we can test the possible combinations of the options.

{"idx": 817, "text": "The question is asking how many plates he should buy, given his home size and meal planning.\nThe first step to answering this question is to understand the size of his home as the number of plates he might need to buy.\n\nIt becomes clear quickly from the question that he might need to buy 1 plate per day for at least every other day of the week. This is because Matt has a lot of guests and he is planning on doing the dishes only once a week. With this in mind, we can remove all possible wrong answers from the question. We can eliminate choices A: 1, as this is the minimum number of plates we expect from the context and 1 is not enough plates to accommodate for all guests.\nAnother wrong choice is B: 2. The context does not say that 2 plates are the recommended amount per person.\nChoice c: 6 is too many plates that might be needed if there is always 7 people in his home. The context does not include 7 people most of the time so 4 is not enough.\nSince we have already eliminated Choice D: 4, he might be needing at least 5 plates for 6 people at least since there are more than 6 people in his home and he only does the dishes once a week, which requires more plates than is needed by Choice E: 1.\nAt this point, it is possible to eliminate Choice E: 5 as it is close to Choice D: 1, but in this case, less is better.\nTherefore, we might be able to answer the question correctly by reducing Choice D: 5 down to Choice C: 4 to make the difference more significant, but that requires further elimination first to be certain.\nTherefore, Choice D: 6 will require further elimination because a 1-person home is already 6 or 5 more plates and adding another to it makes no sense.\nAs we already eliminated Choice B: 2 and there is no other wrong choice left to be eliminated, Matt apparently needs at least 5 plas for his home to accommodate guests.\nAt this point of the answer, it was not certain that Matt needs at least 6 plas, but further elimination is necessary to be fully confident that he needs 6 plas at least and no less.\nTo", "answer": " 38"}

Now that we have a clear trend, we can use it to our advantage.\n4) Knowing that from the previous day James collects 1 less tin, let's use this information to work out how many the final day is. We have to subtract: 2755 - 2754 = 1 day's worth of tins, i.e., 1.

Knowing that Sammy eats less pickle slices than her twin sister, who in turn eats fewer pickle slices than Ron, the conclusion we can draw is that Ron must eat at least fourteen pickle slices.\n4.)

The pickle slices consumption of Sammy is 15 and that of Tammy is 48.\n7.) Ron eats 60% of the pickle slices Tammy eats and not 60% of what Sammy is capable of eating as Sammy is physically incapable of eating 48 pickle \n8.)

By making all the ticket prices even, though, it does not work out this way. Therefore, duplicates are not possible.\n7) In fact, since there are a limited number of even tickets, she can ride only one of the Ferrous Wheel or the Rollers Coaster and still have enough tickets to go on any ride she chooses.  This is how we eliminate the duplicate tickets.\n8) Let's begin with the roller coaster and ride on this one to see if we have enough remaining. \n9) If we have ridden the roller coaster successfully, then we now have enough for the Ferrous Wheels and the Bumper cars.  In this case, the answer is \"4 tickets.\"\n10) Now, if we have chosen to ride the Ferrous wheel and not the roller coaster on the second rotation, then we already have the tickets for the bumper cars and the Ferrous wheels.  The question then becomes how many more tickets should be bought to ride both the Ferrous wheels and the Rollers Coater one more time.

This means 50% of the in-person students are in the classroom on Mondays.\nOption B: school on Tuesday has 15 students. No students are learning from home, so the 15 students are divided into 2 groups: those attending in-person and those attending online. Both groups are equally divided, with 5 students in each group.

{"idx": 832, "text": "1. The question is about the number of popsicle sticks that can be used for the group activity in Art class if Sam, Sid, and Steve each contribute their number of sticks. \n2. The first step in answering this question is to identify the options for the total number of sticks that can be contributed to the activity. \n3. We know from the questions' information that Sam has three times as many sticks as Sid and Sid has twice as much as Steve, so Sam's contribution is thrice Sid's and Sid's contribution is twice Steve's. \n4. Now, we can calculate the total number of stiicks that Sid contributes to the activity. 4. The number of sticks that Sid contributes is thrice the number of sticks that Steve contributes. 5. Therefore, the total number of popsicle stick that Sid contributes is three times the number of sticks Steve contributes. 6. This is three times the number that can be calculated from the information given, so Sid contributes thrice that number too. 7. Therefore, we can conclude that by pooling their resources, Sam, Sid, and Steves contributes a total number of sticks thrice the number that Steve contributes, i.e. 12 popsicles sticks - 3 times.\n8. We already know that the total number of stsicks that Sam and Sid can contribute is thrice the number that Steven can contribute, so the correct answer must be thrice the number given in the question - 12 popsicalice sticks - 3.

Since Janelle has ten dogs, it seems reasonable to say ten dogs=20. Then, we can say that ten dogs=20 and one dog=two.\n\n9) Now using equation 8 to get Janelle\u2019s total number of dogs after distributing ten dogs: Janelle\u2019s total of 20 dogs=10/20=1/2.

His total expenses included $42 (15 * 3/5). \n3) So far we know that the total expenses are $42. 4) Let S be the selling price. Since he wants to make a 10 % profit, we can write S = 1.1 S. 5) The equation we get now is S = 1.464637*S. Since 100% * 1.46 = 1.1 (because 1.46 is 46% of 11), we can put 1.46 on the right side of the equation as 100% / 1.46. This way we'll get S = 100 * 1.425676. 6) We know that S can be expressed as S = 10*S, because S is the selling price. That way we reduce our equation to S = 10^(2/3) * 1.4. 7) We can now solve for S using the quadratic formula. 8) Since the real number 23.5044 is outside the range from 0 to 2, it is a solution. We can also see that S is approximately equal to 1.96 or 1.8465. 9) We know then that S = (2*1.4)/(3*1.4)= 1.85. This is the final answer.\nSo the final answers are S = 1.85", "answer": " 11"}

We can deduce that the break did not affect the length of the flagpole as its length is indicated (12 ft).\n4. Considering this and the context of the question, it makes sense that the length of the new flagpole would not change either.\n5. This means that regardless of how broken the flagpole is, its original length cannot change, so its length will remain 12ft.\n6. As the original tip of the flagpole was dangling two feet off the ground, the new tip should also be two feet off the ground.\n7. Thus, we can deduce that the new length of the flagpole should be 12 feet minus the break of 2 feet, or 10ft.\n\n# Example Solution:\n#  (3, 0.5, 2, 1, 1)\n\n# Final answer: A\n\n# Solution Description:\n# 1. The question explicitly states that the \"flagpole breaks, folding of it in half\", meaning it's two-point fold.\n# 2. The break is 2 feet from the broken end. [Fold line of the flagpole is 10 feet]\n# 3. We have to determine the distance of the end of the flagpole, which is also determined by the break-line\n# 4. This will become A - 2 feet = 10 feet\n# 5. The answer is A - the end point [flagpole]\n\n\n# Note that the test has no 0-indexes, so the answer will not be a 0 index \n# A final note is that these data may be presented in either one or two dimensions, but the input vector in the question is all the time one-dimensional.", "answer": " 7"}

It can be a fraction or number so can be different in decimals or any unit.

Let's see what is the lowest amount Gillian spent at the market. We know $150 more is only three times Sandi' s total so minimum she can spend is Sandi's total(600). The minimum she can spend is $600.\n6. That means Gillian spent at least $600. All we can say from these two options is Gillian spent more than what Sandi spent so Gillian spent minimum $600.

To calculate the number of sticks given to the adult pigs, follow these steps:\na. Calculate the number of adult pigs by simplifying (3/5 \u00f7 1)\nb. Use the simplified numerator and denominator to form a fraction of 3/5 adult pigs\nc. Multiply the simplified fraction above by the number of sticks (300)\nd.

One option in this list has an odd number of brackets {{ -3, 1 }, which has been excluded because -3 is a negative number and the odd brackets are considered to include positive numbers.\n6.

To begin, the dimensions of the house are 20.5ft * 10ft = 205 sqft.\n3.) Similarly, the dimensions of the porch are 6ft * 4.5ft = 27 sqft.\n4.) We can find the total surface area of these two shapes by multiplying the dimensions together:\nSURFACE_AREA(house/porch) = 205 square feet + 27 square feet = 232 square feet\n5.) We can divide the total by 144 to find the number of square feet needed for each. This gives us an answer of 1.6 square feet.\n6.) There are 1,440 sq ft in each square, so to find the number of shingle strips needed, you need to multiply 1,444 shingles times 1,6 square feet in each strip. Doing this, we find that it will take \u00bc of a strip to cover each square foot. Multiplied to the overall square footages of the house and porches gives:\n232 sqft x 1/4 shingle strip per square foot = 58 sqft\n232 sq ft x 1/4x1444 shingle = 3394 shingle strips\n\nSo the answer is 3,394.\n\nInput: A turtle has a shell which is 35 cm long and has four feet, each foot being 9 cm long.

We can start by looking at the options for making loaves of flour.\n3. There are 300g of flours available to Jim. 4. We can eliminate the options for loaves of flour that require more than 200g, since we don't have that much in the cupboard and the kitchen has less than 300g.\n5. We can eliminate the option that requires more, since we do not have enough flour in the pantry to make that many loaves of bread 6. Therefore, the answer should use 300g or less of flour to make loaves of bread.\n7. Choices C and D require the use of more than 20 loaves, which we know from the question that Jim cannot make due to lack of flour present in the pantry and cupboard. 8. However, the other two choices (E and F) require the use of 16 or fewer loaves, which is the correct answer.\n9. Jim can therefore prepare between 20 and 16 loaves of flour using 300g in total.\n10.

If Lizzie has fewer than half as many candy cane as Bobbie, then she has less than three as many candy caned as Bobbie\n4. If Lizzie is fewer than three as many candies as Bobbie, then Lizzie must have fewer than half of the amount of candies as Bobbie\n5. If Lizzie and Bobbi's amount of candies are different, Lizzie has less than three times as many candies as Billie.\n6. If Lizzie's candies are an equal number as Bobbie's, then Billie has fewer than Bobbies' amount of candies.\n7. If Lizzie does not have a smaller amount of candies than Bobbie's and Billie does not, then Bobbie has three times the amount of candies in Lizzie and Billies'.\n8. If Bobbie has three times more candy than Lizzie, Billie must have one-third that number of candy as Bobbie.\n9. Since Billie has one-third the amount of candies that Bobbie has, Bobbies' must be a multiple of three. \n10. Since Bobbie has three times less candies than Billie, Lizzie must have a multiple of three\n11. If Lizzie must have an equal number to Bobbie, then Lisi must have an odd number. So for Bobbi to have an even number, Lizzie must also have an even number.\n12. To figure out how many crayons Lizzie has, we use the following formula: Number Lizzie have x 3 = Number Bobbie have. This solution is based on the given values\n13. Number Lizzie have - Number Bobbie have = Multiplication of 2. Using this formula, we get the following equation: 3 x 2 = 6\n14. The solution is that the number of crayons Lizzy has is six, and we can confirm this by calculating it like so: Lizzie has x 3 = 6\nSo the final answer Lizzie has six cray", "answer": " 27"}

This means that in the context of scoring a point, teams are rewarded for both winning and drawing instead of focusing solely on their wins. \n4) This is consistent with the question, as the team that won 2 games and drew 2 was able to score 6 points in total.\n5) To answer the question, we need to subtract the number of points his team won (3) from the number of points the team they lost to (6).

To find their total, we'll be considering that they now have the totals and thus they added their original number of cards to the ones received as the new total would now contain the total of the cards originally owned by both of them. \n4) Thus Mark's total = 3(2/3*M)  and Lloyd's total will be 1M.

We can consider Wendi's situation by considering possible events: A, B, and C. \n6) Event A - At this point, Wendi has 13 chickens. \n7) Event B - At this point, we can imagine Wendi's situation as: 13 Chickens->B->4 Chickens->17 Chickens. In this case, when Wendi ends up with 9 chickens, B occurs 3 times before C. \n8) Event C - At this point, 9 chickens->C->4 Chickens ->14 Chickens. When C occurs, it is always followed by B, and we can assume B is followed by 4 chickens only once, resulting in 14 chicken\n9) So, if we think about how many times the 4 chickens are brought home followed by B and C, we get 14 chickers - 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 14\n10) Hence, Wendi has 4 more chicken than the number of times the 4 chicken was brought to Wendi.\nSo the final result is 4", "answer": " 13"}

Since she must be four years older than her brother, we can conclude that her age is exactly 31 years.\nLet's analyze what we did:\nWe assumed Djibo's sibling to be 6 years older and younger for them being 6 years apart so we knew their ages have to be multiples of 5.\nWe took the information that he added his age with his sibling's age to get 35, then we subtracted 17 from 35 to get 18, from here we knew that he had a younger sibling.\nSince Djibo is 6 years younger to his sibling, we knew his age had to be 1.\nSo when adding up their ages with 35, the total would be 1 + 35 = 36, a multiple of 5. \nSo our answer is 31 years. \nSo the final answer was 31\n\nInput:Where are you most likely to use a phone book?

Choices:  a: listen to music b: practice playing c: watch other people playing d: look for some new music e: play two songs\nOutput: 1.) We can already use the information here. Because we are asked, \"What can a person do while playing piano?\", we are asked to look at actions which can be done by humans, so we are not really looking at the piano but the person playing it.\n2.) We can eliminate the unrealistic options, options A: listen to music, B: practice playing, and D: looking for some new music. We know that a person cannot be playing the piano and yet be listening, practicing, or finding new songs at the same time. Since these are all actions, they should only be done after the instrument is already played.\n3.) We can also eliminate answer E: play two songs because the question is not asking what we are doing \"while\" playing but what we can be doing \"while\" playing. The word \"while\" only indicates that we play piano while doing some other action.\n4.) This leaves us with option C: watch other people playing as this can be done \"while\" playing piano. We know that, since the question is using the word \"while\", it wants us to do one thing while we do another activity. So, if a person wants to watch other people, it wouldn't be right to ask what he or she would then be doing. The person would still be watching while he or she also plays the piano.\nThus, person playing piano can be doing many things at the same time such as walking, talking, and others", "answer": " 4"}

{"idx": 998, "text": "1) The question gives a detailed scenario of what happens to the fish that is caught.\n2) Based on that information, we can deduce that the question is asking how much fish the Eskimo couple will be given to eat as a result of this exchange.\n3) To answer this, we need to first understand how many fish Oomyapeck will end up eating, and how much each individual will eat. \n4) According to the question, there are 22 fish eyes that Oomyapeck is given in the scenario. So how much will each individual get after this?\n5) We can assume that each individual is given the amount of fish they would have otherwise received minus two, assuming this is Oomyapeck\u2019s portion of the fish catch.  This means that each person will be given only 20 of the originally intended 22 fish.\n6) So how much fish will each person receive after this exchange?\n7) Because each individual is missing two fish, we need to subtract 2 fish from each portion received, to get the total fish each person receives. This means each person will receive 18 fish or 36 eyes. \n8) Therefore the question is asking how many eyes will each person be given.\n9) If each individual is given 36 eyes each, this gives a total of 72, and since 22 eyes were given Oomyapeck previously, this leaves a total of 50 eyes for the couple.\n10) Thus the answer is that each member of the Eskimo couple is given 25 eyes.\nSo the final answwr is that each member will be given 25 fish eyes.\n\nInput: The king is the head of his nation.

We cannot eliminate the first part of the statement.\n3. The first part states that they work, hence they are working at most of the time.\n4. Now, let us look at the second part and eliminate choices, we are asked what a person does during working; we can eliminate choices like reading, because there is no context to show that the person is not actually working.\n5. Another choice is eating or drinking, we cannot eliminate choice as it is possible for someone to be drinking or eating if working at home\n6. The same stands for sleeping or talking as we can do one of them if working at home.\n7. Thus answer is E: listening to music, as they are working, and they do not do things like reading, eating or sleeping.\nSo the final choice\nInput:What kind of bears would you see on a nature trip? Choices: A: brown or polar B: Grizzly, black and polar C: polar, brown and panda D: black and grizzly\nOutput: The kind of bears one would expect to see on a nature trip is grizzly, brown and polar.\n2. We can eliminate choice A: brown and polar as it is not common to see brown bears on a nature trip.\n3. Similarly, we can eliminate choice B: Grizzlly, black and polar. This is because they are all grizzly.\n4. If it is a nature trip that the bears are on they can only be grizzly or brown bears, thus choice B is wrong.\n5. We can also eliminate choice D: black and grizly because both bears are grizzly. If it was a nature trip they cannot both be grizzly as the question is asking for something distinct, thus choice D is wrong\n6. Hence only choice C: polar", "answer": " 10"}

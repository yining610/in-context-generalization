What is known as \"optimal\" in the world is just a tradeoff between complexity and memory. That it, you usually don't want to use a complex heuristic because it takes too much memory, but you do want to use a complex algorithm because it gives you a better result when you need to make quick and complex choices.\n\nThis works both ways, so an optimization problem which is really easy to solve optimally is also really easy to solve optimatorilly.\n\nThis is the key to solutioning the puzzles in Puzzle Craze, where you need to guess the optimizer, not the optimizer itself.\n\nIt is also true that if you understand what an \"optimal\" solution is supposed to be, you can build complex optimizers based on that understanding.\n\nThis is how you build a 6-letter acrostic with 13 words in a 15 letter dictionary.

There is an ending with punctuation, and an empty line below. For question type B, this is followed by a list with only one question type C. For question type C, this is followed by one choice E, then a newline, and optionally a second choice of question type C.\n\n#### For types A and B\n\n1. The first newline after type A text should be one newline after type C question type. This should not be an error, and there should only be one newline after the type A text.\n\n2. If the question has two choices, the end of the question should be the newline. If there is no question choice, then the question text ends with a newline. Also this first newline should be one after the type C question type.\n\n#### For the question type C and E\n\nThe options for the `E` should be one newline apart, and the `E` should come after the first ending newline.\n\n#### How to print this answer:\u00a0\n\nTo print this answer do not change the way the question is entered.

That will make the questions more natural to the audience you want.\n\\item Provide some example code.\n\\item Describe your goal to the goal seekers.\n\\item Make sure the questions are answerable.\n\\item Have the questioners pick their own answers for a few of the questions so that can understand the context and the goal of the questions. Use that to build questions.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nFor the example above, I would be more likely to say, `When I see the number", "answer": " 270"}

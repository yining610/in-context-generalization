When the number 2 is to the left of the decimal point, it means how many times 10 is in a number. When the number 6 is to the left, it means how many 10s are in a number. The number 3 does not mean a different number on every calculator. The number 5 to the left of the last 2 in that decimal is used in the same manner as the right-hand 3. What type of calculator are you using?\nOutput:1 The question is about the significance of the numbers 2, 6, and 3, as depicted by their positions left of the decimal in a decimal.\n2. For the calculator represented by number 2 in the number column, the 2 is read as representing the number 2,048, which is interpreted by subtracting the number 2 from 10, resulting in 8. In this case, 10 divided by 2 is 5, and 5 divided by 2 is two, which is then subtracted by 1 to leave a 0.\n3. The number 6 to the left of the rightmost 2 in that decimal, which results in the number 4,964, is interpreted by dividing the number 6 by 2, resulting in 3.

Nancy's cat spilled half the water in the aquarium, leaving 6 feet worth of water in it.\n2. Nancy filled the aquarium with 3 feet worth of water, followed by an additional 3 feet, for a total of 6 feet worth. Therefore, Nancy has now tripled the amount of water the aquarium already had. If the aquarium had 4 feet worth of water before, Nancy ended up adding 6 feet. 6 is 100% bigger than 4. A hundred percent is called a bigness factor of 100%. Thus, 3 is the bigness factor.\n3. To find the volume in cubic feet, we need to first multiply the three sides of the aquarium with their dimensions.  The formula for volume V=lwh is l x W x H. Because we know the dimensions of the aquarium, we can use them to perform calculation to find the volume for the aquarium in cubic feet.\n4. Given the fact that the volume in cubic yards is 2306.4, we can also express our answer in that denomination to fit the original question.

Answer choices A-F represent different combinations of Dale and Andrew's breakfast meals, and the total cost of each meal is calculated based on the cost of the ingredients.\n3. Answer choices A: \u00a32.20. When Dale and Andrew had 2 slices and 2 eggs, the total cost was \u00a32.20 because the cost for 2 eggs is \u00a36 and the cost for 2 slices of bread is \u00a34. This makes \u00a36 + \u00a34 = \u00a310. Dale had 4 slices of toast which cost \u00a34, making Dale's total cost of food \u00a314, and Andrew had 8 slices of toast, which cost \u00a38, giving Andrew's total \u00a322.\n4. Total cost is \u00a314 + \u00a322 = \u00a336, which is \u00a318.20, which is \u00a31.80 more than \u00a316.40, which is 2.20\n5. Answer choice B: \u00a33.20. If Andrew's breakfast was a slice of toast and an egg, the total cost would be \u00a34, so he would have had 2 slices for \u00a38. Therefore, Andrew's total cost would be \u00a312+8-1 which is \u00a315.20.\n6. Answer choices C: \u00a38.\n7. In this scenario, Dale and Andrew\u2019sa breakfast cost \u00a314 because each egg costs \u00a33 and each slice of toast costs the same amount.\n\n8. Answer choice D: \u00a38.20. If Dale had 2 eggs and Andrew had 2 pieces of toast, the total cost would also be \u00a38 because the cost of 2 eggs and 2 pieces of toasted bread is \u00a312. Therefore, the total cost is \u00a325 for each meal.\n9. Answer choice E: \u00a34.20. If both Dale and Andrew had a slice of toast, then the total cost for both would be \u00a313 if they each had 1 egg.

{"idx": 90, "text": "Given an example, the problem here is 40 borrowed books per day on the average and 40% higher on Friday. It could be 44 on average, 48 on Friday. The goal is to determine how many books does he borrow each week. Here is how to tackle the problem:\n1. To reduce the number, it is not necessary to reduce to zero. What's needed to do is to reduce the difference by eliminating the extra borrowed books on Friday but still maintain the average 40 books per day. So how many books are borrowed on Friday? The difference between days needs to be kept, so the number of books has to be the same. So the number of books on Friday is 32.4 x 10^2 (44 books-32.4 books)\n2. To find how many books do they need to take on total if they are borrowed at average rate of 40 books a day, is 40 x 5 days = 200 on average and 200-32.4=167.6. It is impossible for the borrower to take out 168 books on Friday so we have to decrease the number of books per day which is by 2 or 4 book per day because there is some extra book borrowed on Friday but the library is still open, so the new total is 168 books\n3. To make sure the total is equal to 400, we need to add some extra books to get to there but keeping the average at 40 per day. We need to add 14.4 books per day on average so that 168 books +14.4 new books is 400 which is 684.4 books. As Friday is the only date where an additional book can be taken out\n4. Adding the 200 books average and 14.4 new book averages is 344.4 added in the beginning + 68.4 added in the end, or totaling 413.2 books would be taken out\nFinal answer is 413.4 books taken out during the week", "answer": " 216"}

One way to think about this is to consider how many days are in that period, and how much food he needs each day. It is December 1.

In December, 1 cup, Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup of food in the morning and \n1/2 cup of the birds food in the afternoon. In January, Herman feeds 1/2 cup the birds food both in the morning and in the afternoon. In February, Herman again feeds 1/4 cup the birds' food both in the morning in the afternoon.\n3) Thus, Herman will need to buy 60 cups of food in December (one cup in the morning and one cup in the afternoon, 26 days in this month), 30 cups of food (1/2 cup) in January (21 days in January), and 30 cups (1/2 cup each day) in February (28 days in Feb).

The solution is $4a + 6b because babysitters earn $6 for Sally and $4 for Bob. Therefore the babysitter' s salary is $4a + $6b = $10A total babysitter\u2019s salary is $10a and $10b.\n\nThe total babysitter salary is: a + b total babysitter= $20a+ $20b the babysiters' total salary.\n\nNow consider if babysitters saved half of their salary.

It takes John 20 pages /day to write a book. Then, it would take 400 pages / 20 pages = 20 days / 20 books = 20 /20 = 1 book every day. And so, 3 books would take 3 * 20 = 20 * 3 = 60 days = 15 days.\n3. Answer Choice B: 4 days. In the scenario, John writes 20 pages / day, or 14 pages / day. The books have 400 pages total each. So, 400 /14 = 29 days. If 4 books = 4 \u00d7 (14 pages) = 56 pages. Therefore, 56 pages / 14 pages = 56 pages /4 = 14 pages = Books. So, it would take John 3 books / day 30 days = 30 * 4 =4 books = 4 / day = 30 * (4 pages) / 4 = 30 books.\n4. Answer Choice C:10 days. Three books each have 400pages. And thus it takes 400 pages divided by 20 pages and that is 20 / 20 = 10 pages / day. So if 3 books / day = 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 pages / day. And 30 pages /10 pages = 3 books. Therefore, the answer will be 3 books / day and 30 pages /day.\n5. It takes 0.6 pages /day to write one page. So if 400 pages \u00f7 0.6 pages =333 days / day and 333 = 7 days /book /30 pages. So the answer is the correct answer is 20 days / day.\n\n6.Thus, the answer is 15 days and the right answer is choice A because it is the most accurate answers.\n\nInput: A frog uses 3 gallons of water everyday.

Marvin sold 3 fewer than 45 which we can round up to zero.  Which means Marvin sold up to 45 bars  Tina sold eight fewer than 45 ( 45- 33= 12  Then 13*3= 46)  So Tina sold up to 46 bars  Since Marvin and Tina were both at number 45 bars sold  There were 45 bars left to find out how much the candy bars cost.  A total of 80$ are invested in the candy bars. Since 45 is half of 80 and we know there were an equal number of both bars. We divide each bar's price by 2 to find Marvin's price.  And Tina's price if equal Marvin's price  Marvin's price is 4$  Tina's price is also 4$.  This means $5 dollars were raised from the sale  We got there from 80-45= 35 35 divided by each candy bar is 1.07077140.....  Multiplying it by 2 is 2.14126160......

{"idx": 116, "text": "1. The question is basically asking, \"How many jelly beans could there be in the jar?\"\n\n2. A first step is to restate the question in terms of the number of jelly beans there are in the jar, and the rest of the jelly beens are still there for some reason. Let's say we know there are $n$ jelly beans in the jar. Then there must be the rest of the $4\\frac{7}{4}$ jelly beans and the rest of the $1\\frac{25}{75}$ jelly beans outside. This gives us $\\frac{4}{4}+2.25=2.75$ jelly beans outside, so $n-2.75$ and $2.75n-1.25$ are both nonnegative, or $-0.25n+1.25\\ge 0$ and $1.25n\\ge 2.25$. \n\n3. That can be rearranged as $1.95n$ is more than or equal to $2.25$. Rearrange again: $0.95n$ must be greater than or equal to $1.25$, so $n$ must be more than or equal to $\\frac{1.25}{0.95}=1.25$. So, if there are $1.44n$ jelly beansthis many jelly beans, then $n$ must go into the jar and there are $4(n)=1.44n-1.2n$ to go outside. So if $n=1.44$ jelly beans, $n-1.2=(1.44-1.2)$ jelly beans are outside. So if there are $100$ jelly beans this many are in the jar and $98.6$ are outside. \n\n4.-Now, if $98.6\\in (1,44)$ we know, just rearranging the rest of the equation that $2\\times (100-98.6)=22.4$ must be more than the rest of the jellying beans, so $100-99.22=0.3$. $98.6=1\\times", "answer": " 4000"}

{"idx": 132, "text": "As a first step, let's assume that each chapter in the book has 40 pages. Then the first thing we need to do is convert the time that Mitchell had studied from into a fraction, 10/(24 hours). So the time that Mitchell had read from the book is 10 \u00f7 24, which is about 0.416666667 hours. Now, according to the question, we know that at 4 oclock, Mitchell had read 89 pages from the 11th and 12th chapters of the book together which is equal to 29 pages. We also know that after 4 o'clock she had not read from the 11 chapters of the book, but continued her studies in other chapters of the book and read 64 pages from 13th to 17th chapters. We also know the quantity of books, that is 40 pages per chapter. Now, Mitchell read in total 89 pages from 11th and the 12th chap, and in addition to that, she read 382 pages from 13 to 17. Finally if we add the amount of pages that she had already read at 4 o clock which is 29 (which means she hadn't read 261 pages total) with the total number of pages she read in the rest of the chapters, it is equal to 410 pages altogether.\n\nSo the correct answer is (1025 - 410) / (24 / 363).\n\n### Instruction: answer the following grade math question", "answer": " 500"}

She wants to purchase her paint from a company whose average price is $2.50 per yard and which offers a 10% discount for 8 or more yards. Will Anna enjoy a 10% overall discount?\nOutPut:Anna will not enjoy a 10 percent overall discount for her paint.  The reason is that the average price for 8 yards is $2.55, which is more expensive than the average price of $2.50 for a single yard.  Furthermore, 8 yards will cost Anna $20.20, which is less than $21.80 if she purchases 8 yards instead of just 2 yards at the usual rate.  Thus, Anna will enjoy a larger discount from paying $20.2 for 8 yards than she would from paying $21.8 at the usual per yard rate.Since the discount is less than 10%, and since Anna will be paying at the usual per yard price for 2 yards, Anna will not receive a 10% savings overall.

Since it is mentioned that his record score is 4 touchdowns higher than the old record, so we know that the new record is 16 points higher than the old one; to find the old record, subtract 300 from 16, and finally we have the old record as 264.\n4: Thus, the new record total of 16 points is 264 (old record) + 16 (how many extra points).\n5: Thus, the new season record is 264 plus 16, which leads to the answer 280 points (rounded off).", "answer": " 72"}

{"idx": 207, "text": "The question is asking how many lions were in Londolozi when there were only 148 lion cubs after 1 year.\n\n1. There are at least 148 lambs left unaccounted for, so it is safe to assume that when the lions are born, when they grow up to be adult lions, and when they die, there always are at least 150 lions in London.\n2. After 1 year, when only 148 cubs are left, there are either no unborn cubs or some cubs have died.\n3. However, there are unborn cubs because the rate of birth is greater than the death rate, so there must have been one more unborn cub at the start. This means that there were 1 less cub the previous year, so the number of cubs is reduced by 150 when including unborn cubs, which results in 148 cubbs.\n4. However, it is more correct to have the unborn cub as a separate question, assuming birth and death and adding both.\n5. Thus, (1-1/5) + 1+ (1/1) - 1 = 1.5-1 + 1 + 1/1 = 2 cubs in the first year.

The 640-ft perimeter equals 128 linear feet. Because 128 linear ft x 4 linear feet/linear foot = 155 linear feet. 3 155/3 = 50/3 = 16.7, which means the 50-ft length of short side of the fencce equals 16.7 ft in length x 4 ft/16.7 ft = 100/13 = 7.7 ft long. 4 1 = 8.\n5.

In this case, we see that we are asked about the price of a house and a barn as a total price for a property.  Since the home and the barn are in the same property, we can add up the $98 per square ft price for the house, and the $98 per sq ft price for the barn to get the total price for the property.\n2. We can also use the same strategy as the first step above, so we can break down the question from three components: the home, the barn, and the total property.  For the home, the price is $98 per sq foot or 98 x 2,40\n3. Since the home is 2,46,40 square feet total, the price for the home itself would be 2,46$. The barn is smaller at 1,00 square feet of space, so we would multiply the home's price ($2,46$) by 1,00 and get $247 for the total for the barn.

No more information is given\n\nAnswer:\n\n\nTo start, we can rewrite the question as a statement:\nNumber of cars Jim has = number of model cars he collects = 301\n\nLet's start by solving for number of Fords.\nIn this question, we have the following information:\n\n\n\nJ 4 times more than Fords --> 4x\n3 more than twice F\n\n\n\nIn simple terms, we can assume that each time we increase the amount of Fords in Jim's collection by some number, that will double the amount of Buicks and Fords. For example, if\nJ 2 times more than twice F\nw\n\nThis means that we multiply the amount of Fords by two and double the amount of Fords and Buicks that we already had, which means that Jim now has [301 x 4 x 2 ] total Fords and [301 x3 x 2 ] total Buicks for a total of 1,206 cars.", "answer": " 220"}

However, this can be accommodated by reducing the class sizes of the other seven elementary grades by approximately 11% over those grades' average class size to keep class size ratios under 20 students to 1 teacher among the K-6 grades.

I immediately locked the door from the inside and stayed there. Since the clown might be hiding on my porch (where I left my front door), if I opened the door, a clown would jump me. However, to get any food or water, I'd have to let my dog out. I'd rather die than let the clown get me before getting help, since it is unlikely that anyone will hear a scream from the street. Would a good thing that my neighbor fed the dog last night be better or worse than opening the door and letting the clown capture me in order to let the dog out? Explain.  \nOutput:The situation is that a clown is hiding outside your front door, but you are locked in your house, so you know that your dog is starving, even as you realize that no one will be able to help you if the clown catches you so you will die. There are multiple ways of solving the problem, but by far the best way is to let the dog go outside. Why? The answer is that you need to allow your dog to go outside in order to keep you safe and ensure that you don't die.\nThe dog can be an additional source of security, as the dog might chase the clown away, which would allow you to come out of your house safely and call for help. Additionally, if you don't let the clown inside your house, then you can let your dog out and have another source of security when you leave your house.\nTherefore, opening the door and letting your dog out is the best course of action.\n\nInput:After months of training, you learned how to make cute puppets with your mouth alone!

Half the numbers are less than it; half the numbers are greater.  If there is an even number, the average will be the middle number. \nFor example, the two middle numbers of the group 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 2 and 3.  There\nare three numbers that fall into each half: 1, 2 and 4.\nThe median can also be used to describe the \"middle\" of a statistical sample such as a\npopulation.

For example, 72 = 5496.

How much longer will it take than if you had gone directly to the library?\nOutput: (it must be 80 percent of the walking time)\n\nInput:In the summer, you had to walk from your home to your school every day. Everyday, you get to school 40 minutes before the school day starts. On Monday, your parents asked you to run some errands before school. What time should you set your alarm so you are at school on time?\n\nOutput:Monday = 40 minutes, and the errand takes 15 minutes and you still have to go to school. (So total time spent) = Monday+15+school = 65 minutes, but since you have to walk in half an hour before school start, it would be 25 minutes before school and not the other way round, so that equals to 40-25 = 15\n\nSo you must set the alarm for 15 minutes before school starts to be on time.\n```", "answer": " 230"}

C: the volume of the prism as computed by its length as well as its width, height, and the volume of the three-dimensional shape. D: the area of the front and side of the prism. E: an object that is equal in length.\nOutput: It is most helpful to know the dimensions of the base and all of the other dimensions of the right-sided prism. We know the rectangular shape of the object; if the rectangular prism is a cube (the shape of 1\" on each side), the dimensions of the base (the bottom 1\" to the shape), height, and volume are known. If we take the area of the base and multiply it by two, we will know the product of the dimensions perpendicular to the base, and from then one can easily calculate the diagonal of the prism.\n\nSince the answer choice A contains all the information we need in our problem, thus the answer is A: the width of a base and all measurements of a sides.\n\nInput: Choose the correct option for which three statements could be arranged into fact families as shown.\n[pic]\nOutput: Statement 2 could be related to 1 by 1 = x + y + z.

How can we account for the extra $4? Since there are two extra siblings than the question, we must assume that the cost per ticket is not the same amount. That is, each of the adults are being charged $11, each of the children are being charged $9, and each of the siblings are being charged $5. Thus,\nFor each of the extra siblings:\nAdults   $ 11\nChildren  $  9\nSiblings $  5\nThis implies that the final total must be $64 + $64 + $ 24 = $152.\nIt is important to note that all prices were given in dollars. Thus, the final answer is $128.\n\n#### What is the purpose of this contest?\n\nTo encourage our students to engage in meaningful mathematics.

The statement \"He adds 1 rep a week and once he gets to\" indicates that he stops adding 1 rep after 6 rep.  Thus, when John's wall push up limit is 6, he stops adding 1 to his wall push-ups.\n3. Next we determine John's wall pushup to low elevation pushup elevation limit.  John starts by doing a wall push-up 5 consecutive days, which means that he does 6 push-ups a week and 30 per month.  In order to achieve low push-ups, he raises the wall push-up limit by 1 per week.  Therefore, after the 6 weeks that John did wall push-ups, he would need 7 weeks to do low push-ups.\n4.

The rule above can be used to find out how much the person has after each expense or deposit.\n\nThe first thing needed for finding the rule is a variable.  Let's call it X.  The value of X stays the same no matter what's happening.  We are also going to be making the assumption that the value of X remains equal or greater than zero (to keep it simpler for the first two steps, you can say the value of X has to be at the last two steps or greater than those two steps.  The math would still be the same.)\n\nThe variable can change (go up or down) if we have either an expense or a deposit, while the value cannot, of course.  The value of $10 is never going to be an expense, but it can be changed by an expense or a sum made.  Therefore, the value of X stays at $10 until either something happens which would reduce it below the value of $10, or the value is greater than or equal to the amount of money in the account.\n\nThe rule states that if we make $4, the value of X will become $9.

So it means that total number of balls are bought by Dan,Gus and Chris are respectively as follows,5dozen,2dozen,48 balls.=60,144 balls.=100 balls total.\nSo, the final answer is 120.\n\nInput: What city holds the record for most days above 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43.9 degrees Celsius)?\nOutput: 1, Firstly, it has to be known from the statement that, in which city the question is about.

It is recommended to use the dollar to make sure that it is even though, because in this problem it's recommended that you think $1.10-($1.10-$0.20) = 0.90, which is $0.10, which doesn't equal anything.\nAlso, I personally think it's weird for the question to specify that you're $0.20 short.

I chose 27 because it is less than 28 and closer to 28 than the 25 which is closer to 28, therefore I chose 27.\nInput: What're John's favorite and least-favorite subjects? \nAnswer:\nJohn's favorite subject is Math, while he least-favourite is science.", "answer": " 249"}

{"idx": 563, "text": "7. Answer choice A: 36 cups of dog food\nLet n be the total amount of dog food needed for 6 days. The total amount of food Joy will need each day is n divided by 6.\nLet's calculate the average amount of food Joy will consume each day. Since there are 7 days in the week, the average daily food consumption is 1.5(5), where 4 is the amount of dog food needed in the 4 day period after 1 day.\nThus, the average daily food intake for Joy is 3 cups of dog food.\nFor the first day, she needs 3*(1) cups of dog food, so Joy needs (3 cups of dog * 65% of the daily dog food requirement = 80.5 cups of dog food). For her second day of dog food intake, let Joy require 3 cups and puppies each require 1/2 cup:\nTherefore, Joy will need (3 (1.5)) and the puppies will individually consume (1/2 (1)) of dog food, amounting to (4.5 )*. There is (1.5) remainder, so she will have 86.5 cups of  dog food remaining. For her third day of dog food consumption, let Joy eat 2*3 cups. Puppies each will only eat (1/2 * 3) amount; thus, Joy needs (2*3) + 5*(1/2) cups of dog  food, which amounts (11)*. (1.5) cups of dog is remain\n\nTherefore, Joy needs (11.5) * cups of dog food in total. \n\nShe will need (3 * 7) = 21 cups for day 1, (3 * 6) = 18 cups for day 2, and (3 * 5) = 15 cups for day 3.\n\nThus, Joy needs 86.5 + 18 + 15 = 120.5 cups total which meets the specifications.\n\nOutput:", "answer": " 57"}

This question is a good one, since it tests the ability to understand \"multiple relationships\" between people and money involved in such an arrangement.\n2.) The question says \"he had already given $1000 as advance to each of his four friends.\" If one friend = 1.00 dollar, then it says he gave $1000 for all friends (3.00), or, in other words, there are $3 of friends that he got $1000 from every one.

If Tina started working on the keyboard after she finishes her assignment, which she has time to do, the total time for Tina to both complete the assignment and clean the keyboard is 22.5 minutes because she can add up the two tasks given and this time should not exceed the time given because then we are looking into an absolute value which will always exceed a number.\n3.

If you add 3 to each one and then divide by 2, the average is 56.  How large is the average increase?\nOutput:The average of five numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by 5. In this example the sum is 80, and dividing by 5, the average is 16. If we add 3 to this, the sum is 19, which is less than the average by 3. This is a decrease in the average, and we must subtract 3 from our average to get back to the original value. Thus, the overall average for this problem is decreased by 3, and the answer for how large the average increase is +3.\n\nInput:Jonathan just bought a new pair of jeans that slip on easily, and which fit perfectly by the time he has gotten all the way into them, but will quickly change after a time spent wearing them.\nWhat kind of jeans did Jonathan buy, if it's the case that he actually bought a pair whose size was too small?\nOutput:This kind of jean is the kind that is loose at the start, and gets tighter after being worn.

We will have 3 equations in 2 unknowns, because we already know v + 1 is 3 times the distance Freddie and Velma\u2019s flashlights could be seen, Veronica\u2019s distance, and Freddie\u2019s distance, which is v + 2.  This gives us:\nv + 2 = v + 1\nv = v \u2013 2\nWe solve for v to get v = 2,000 + 3\nThis is how I answered the question: \nTo figure out how much longer Freddie\u2019s flashlight was, I found the distance that Velma\u2019s could be seen from.  I solved for the distance that Velma can be seen and found by solving for Veronica the distance Freddie can be from Velma.  This is (Veronica \u2010 Velma) = Freddie.  I used the equation that 4 times Freddie\u2019s distance from Velma makes it as far away from Veronica as Veronica is from Velma.  So, (v + 1) = (v + 4) = Freddie.\nTo find the answer to the question, I subtracted the distance that Veronica could be seen with her flashlight.  Since Freddie was 3 times farther, which is to say Freddie was three more equations away from Velma, Velma would be as far away from Verona as Freddie was from Velma.  Since Freddie\u2019s and Velma\u2019s could both be seen from Veronica\u2019s distance + 1, Velma\u2019s flash could be seen from a farther space.\nAnswer: Velma\u2019s flash was 3000 more feet away from Veronica.\nTherefore, Answer choice A is A because Freddie\u2019s flash was 2000 more feet from Veronica, this is because it can be seen three times farther compared to Veronica\u2019a flash.", "answer": " 12,000"}

{"idx": 679, "text": "1 The question is asking how many seconds it will take the border collie, who can run at a speed of 5 ft/s, to catch up to the tennis ball that Belinda, who can throw the ball at a speed of ft/s, throws.\n2. Answer choice: seconds. It takes only seconds for Belinda's ball to reach its peak height of 20 ft after Belinda throws it. Since the ball will be falling for 8 seconds after reaching this peak, the ball must have already begun falling after traveling 20/20-20 = 0.3 miles since Belinda threw it.\n3. Answer: In the previous answer, we saw that the ball fell for a distance of 0.3 miles in the 0.3 seconds. Since we know that the dog can run at a speed 5 ft/s we can also find the total distance the dog would run in this time.\n4. Answer: From the last output it can be known that the dog can only run a maximum distance of 0.5 miles in the time it takes the ball to fall.\n5. Therefore, 0.5 miles = 5 ft * 0.3 seconds or 5ft * 0.3 miles = 1.5 miles. As such, the dog only needs time 0.7 seconds (less than one second) to catch up to the falling ball.\n6. Thus: dog can cover a maximum distance of 1.5 miles in 0.7 seconds = 13 feet per second. It can be seen that the dog would be able to stop the ball and catch it with ease, making it impossible for Belinda to throw any further.

If the width is 4 units, how many units wide is the object?\nOutput: 5 units The question asked what is the dimension of a rectangle with a width equal to 4 times its length. To solve this problem, I use these assumptions: The width and the length each equal a whole number, and the width is at least one, since 4 times a whole number always yields a positive and whole number. So one possible solution is 4 * 4 = 16, and we know the width is at least 1 (16 or 4 times the length is greater than 4 times 1). Therefore, the object can be no smaller than a dimension of 4 units. Also, we know that when a size x is twice its size y, the number of times y is smaller than x.  Therefore, this number of times is 4. (4 times 4 is 8 and 4 times 4)\nSo, as the question stated, we want to find n, for n times 4 > 4, so n > 4, and the object is 4 times longer than it is wide.

{"idx": 696, "text": "In this problem, we are given the ratios of puree and cream used in making the smoothies, but not the total volume of liquid used. The solution to the problem is to set up and solve the correct equation for the smoothies per-capita.\n1. The ratio of cream to watermelon is 9 and the ratio of watermelon to cream is 9. Thus, we'll set up an equation involving the percentage of the cream mixture and the percentage of the watermelon mixture.\n2. Let a represent the percentage of water melon mixture that's needed to make a serving of 150 mL of smoothie. There are 1170 mL total liquid (watermelon and cream)\n3. Now we have an equation with two variables that will allow us to solve for our answer. The formula for mL of watermelon mixture of the serving is: 150 m / 0.9808\n4. This tells us that we need 150 m/0.980, which is equivalent to about 156 mL of puree to make a smoothie. Thus, a = 1.56. Now we can move over to the cream and use this ratio. The formula for how much cream will be in a serving of the smoothie from the equation below.\n5. And the total volume of cream in a serving is 100/(9*0.980). Thus the total liquid for a smoothie is 1170 *(1.56) + (100/(9 * 0.98))\n6. Which can be set up a little bit more cleanly as 1170 (1.56) * (1+0.092) (since 0.98 is 0.98 rounded). We can clear off our solution a bit more by looking at the numbers in the equation.\n7. The numerator is 1174, which means the denominator is 1169. This means we have 50/100 volume of both puree and cream in the smoothie. 50/1169 has a ratio of 0.436 and 0.437. This means", "answer": " 4"}

So these three values represent the grand total of visitors on that day. Now lets see our options.\nOption A: Oil Refineries\nOption A describes 50 visitors went to the oil refinery and gets doubled so the total number of people will be increased to 100, but on the other 4 days 50 people will have to be added to 100 so the grand total will be increased to 200.\nSo the grand total is 200\nOption B: Wall\nOption B talks about the wall of 10 people to visit the library and got doubled to 20 to go to library. And now we need to subtract 50 people will visit the library in one day so in total 150 people will visit. \nSo the grand total will be 150\nOption C: Show\nShow talks about 20 people will visit the show to the visitors and will get doubled and all the rest 3 people will visit the library. So the grand total will be same\nSo the grand total of the show is the same.\nOption D: Own Home\nOption D talks about 50 people will go to their home and 10 people will visit the 7 days the library is open. So the grand total number of visitors will be 65.\nOption E: Water Fountain\nOption E talks about 10 people will use the water fountain at their library and doubled and they were visiting the library from Monday to Friday. So the grand total is 150 visitors. So the grand total of visitors will be 155 people.\nSo the grand number of visitors will be D: Own Home's 65 + E: Water Fountains 155 makes the grand total to be 220.\nThus 220 is the final answer.", "answer": " 250"}

Then calculate the probability of being out of a baseball team as follows,P(not A)=1-P(A)=1-0.59=0.41. Now you have 2 mutually exclusive events that occur with the same probability. Since the probability of both occurring is same (probability of being in a baseball with being in a college basketball team) and probability of one occurring is the probability of the other occurring (proability of being in a college basketball and not being in a college basketball) then the probability of not being in a baseball is 1 which can be expressed by the formula P(not A)=P(A)+P(not A)=0.41+0.59=1. \nSo to calculate P(not B) we just add 0.69 which equals P(A) to P(not A). This is the definition of complementary probability which is also equal to 1 in this case. \nSo in the complementary probability of being in a basketball or not being in a college baseball is 1.  To calculate the probability of being being in a baseball team then, we just need to subtract P(A) from P(not B). \nSo the answer is P(A or not A)=0.59-0.41=1-0.41.", "answer": " 64"}

When the answer choice (A) (8 miles) is selected, this is incorrect, because John would not travel this distance since he will only run for 30 minutes plus an additional 30 min.\n2. When answer choice (B) (6 miles) is selected, John would travel that distance since he ran for 30 min with his dog at 4 mi/hour and then travelled another 30 min alone at 6 mi/hour, thus 6 +6 +6 = 18 mi, and then the solution must be 18/3 = 6 miles.\n3. When answer choice (C) (10 miles) is selected, answer choice (A) would provide the correct. answer since 4 miles x 5 mi = 20 mi and an additional 10mi would be 30 mi in total, and therefore, the answer is 30/3 = 10.\n4. When answer choice (D) (4 miles) is selected, the answer choice would be also correct like answer choice (B) if 30 min (not 30 mi) is divided by 4 mi/hour, thus it would be 30/4 = 8 mi, and therefore, the correct answer ( A )\n5.

We then use the following method to calculate the number of members in the band:\n\nWe know there are 62 students, so 9 of the 62 are not in the band and 10 of the 62 students are in the band means that 61 of the 62 total are not in the band.\n\nTherefore, the solution is as follows:\n\nSince we know 62 students are present, it means 9 of them are not in the band which means 53 students can be found in the band since 64 minus 9 equals 55. So there are 53 students in the band which, when divided by 7 students equals 7.9290.", "answer": " 1500"}

One method would be to find out how many slices of bread have to go in each sandwich, and multiply that by four, that would give you the slices it takes to create each sandwich.  Now that we know how many slices we need for each sandwich, all we need to do is multiply it by the number of sandwiches, and you get our result.  This formula works for any combination of sandwiches and slices in them, though it is easiest to write for 2 slices bread to be inside of each sandwich. Let's work this out to see what the formula would look like. So, 8 x 2 = ___________\n7. Once again, he has given you the number of sandwich that he has made, so we will find out the number of slices that go into each sandwich, and then multiply that by the amount of sandwiches. Now you will need to multiply the number of sandwichs by the number of pieces of bread that go into one sandwich.  It can be rewritten as follows: The number of sandwhichs x the number of pieces of the sandwhich (or the slices of bread that go in it) equals the number of pieces of slices of bread you need to make the sandwiches (if I've done my math correctly).

To solve this problem, we first calculate the cost of the each ride individually.\n3. The cost of riding the bumper car is $2.\n4. The cost of ridden the space shuttle is $4.\n5.

{"idx": 790, "text": "19 days\nThere are several ways to approach this problem. An intuitive way might be to say that, given that James hurt himself exercising, exercising again will hurt him and so this will add 3 days.\n\nSo at this point, James has suffered 6 days.\n\nIn this 6 days, 3 days have passed and he has healed to the point that he can start exercising again. Note that if James had not injured himself, then these 3 days is the time it takes him to recover from minor exertion, so there is no change to the 3 days.\nThe next question to answer is how long James is going to wait before he starts exercising again. This will be the next 3 days.\nSo, in a total of 12 days, James has already been hurt and has already healed.  How many total days will it take for James to fully recuperate so that he can start lifting heavy again?\nThis will be another 5 days. So, if there were 12 days, 12 days will equal 15 days, but it would take a total of 19 days until James can lift heavy again.\nThe conclusion here is that he will take a total of 22 days. But, wait! Doesn't the pain subside after 3 days? It probably did, but this does not account for the pain that healing causes and the pain caused by exercising heavy. So, the final answer is that he will take 22 days.\nSo the final sentence is that James's injury will take 19 days to fully heal and he will take 2 more days to wait before he exercises heavy again.\nSo the answer is B: 19 days", "answer": " 39"}

First we get the distance covered by the cyclist and train in a minute. The speed of cyclist is $60$ km/h and that of the train is $60km/hr$. Then let the $t$ be the variable to determine the time it takes for cyclist to catch the time with the speed $60$ kmph. Now total distance covered by both the travelers in one minute would be $60km/t+x$ where $x=0$. The total sum would be $60^2-x$. This sum would be minimized when the value of x would be zero. And in that value of $x$, total time is $60$ minutes. Hence the answer is 60.\n\nInput:-x-12.5=-0.06. So x=498.25 km.\n\nInput: There are 1890 students", "answer": " 345"}

Here's how the math works out - Since you start off with \"10 dogs and 17 cats.\" Dogs=10, Cats=17. 10 divided by 10 equals 1; 17 divided by 17 gives you a decimal, 0.1 or 1/10. You could replace 0.1 with 0.01 if you'd like. So there are 10 dogs. Divide to find the number of dogs your left with, now 10 divided by (1/10), means that there was a decimal that you subtracted from both sides. 10 divided 0.1 0.9 (or 9/10) to get 9. You can replace 9/10 with any fraction as long as you remember to subtract the original 1/10 from both the numerator and denominator.

The combined effect of these two means that Andy would age by 30% of what Rahim now, and Rahim would be 14 times as old as Andy in 5 years.\n4- Now let's compute the difference between Rahim and Andy. They are both 6 now. In 5 years, Rahim will be 11 and Andy will be 9. Therefore, they will age for 6 years and Rahim will be 5 times the age of Andy, for a difference of 50%.\n5- Andy would be six time the age of Rahim. When it comes to age 9 + 30% = 11, plus rahim age of 6 + 50% = 9 means 9 + 6 = 15 so andy is 9 times as old as Rahlim\n6- Conclusion: Andy would have aged for 6 years.

In order to solve this question, we need to \n1) find the distance the 1 miles head-start give, and \n2) find the total time needed.\n\n3. To solve question 1, let's first convert the answer choice from miles per hour to minutes per mile so we can compare directly. In a mile, their conversion rates are 6/mph=15/mi, 9/mph=18/mi, where (15 or 18)/mi=1. 6/60=1/10, 9/60=1.167/10, so Jim ran 16.7 miles further.\n4. Then to solve question 2, I use an equation where d=distance, t=total time, c=speed. \n5. We already know that their speeds are 6/miles/hour and 9/miles/hour. \n6. So, we can put in:\n1) d=0 which is how much time after question 1 that he gets caught, \n2) t=total time, \n2) c=(speed in answer choice) which is 9 in this case for Jim.\n\nSo we need to use another equation that has a function we can plug in: rate=distance time.

We can't figure out the number of bolts from just this one piece of information, so we need to use trial and error.\n\nLet us assume the final number of bolts was \\(B\\), and we calculated the final number of nuts to be \\(N\\).

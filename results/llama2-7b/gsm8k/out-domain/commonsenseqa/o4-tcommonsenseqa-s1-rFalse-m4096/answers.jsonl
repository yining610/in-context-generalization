How we will draw such a conclusion is based on human logic and experience. Logicians often use inductive and abductive reasoning. You can choose inductive reasoning to give your conclusion.\nFor example, I have a set of information. After analysis, I find there is no contradiction, so I tend to draw a conclusion that the information is true. This is abductive reasoning.\nFor example, there are two possible conclusions from the following information that I think are not too outrageous. I choose the second conclusion because I know the information is true and the second conclusion seems more logical. This is inductive reasoning.\n\nInput: There is no more information than this.\nOutput: I think the following conclusions are not too far off:\n\n1.

Some examples of them are: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There are also a few other ones that are in the same category. The first one is the modular arithmetic. It means that the output of the operation are only allowed to take one of the available input values. For example, the most common example of the operation is the modulo operation, where the remainder of division is the output.\n\n\n#####Question 2\n\n## What type is this? It also has a name:\n\n### Operations with fractions\nFractions means that you are taking parts from a whole and that is what you would be doing when multiplying, dividing or adding fractions. The thing about it is that you cannot multiply by a fraction. This is why there is a special way of doing it. The multiplication of three fractions is not done in the same way as the multiplication of one fraction.\n\n\n####Question 3\n\nHow is the addition done?\n\nAddition of two fractions with different denominators needs you to find a common denominator. The best way to do this is to multiply both top and the bottom by the LCM. The LCM here is the Least Common Multiple.\n\n\n###### Question 4\nHow is addition of two fractions with the same denominator done?\n\nThe addition of two fractions where the denominator is common to both is done by addition of the numerators using the usual mathematical operation.\n\n\n#### Question 5\n\n### Division of fractions\n\n## How is division of fractions done?\nThe only difference is that you need to divide numerators instead of the usual division of two numerical values. The way to do it is to find the common denominator of both values and divide both numerators with it.\n\n\n# Question 6\n\n### How the multiplication of a fraction by a fraction should be done?\nThere are special ways depending on what the denominator has in common with the other denominators.\n\nMultiplication by a Fraction with Inverted Reciprocal as Denominator\nMultiplication", "answer": " 2"}

We start by filling in the unique cells in a 3x3 grid:\n\n* *\n***\n* *\n\nNote that the 2nd and 3rd cells are unique. Since they both have to contain the number 1, then it must be that the remaining cells must also either contain 1 or 3 (since a 3x3 has exactly 6 unique cells).\n\nThis leaves us with 1, 3, 6, 10, and 12. We must have that each cell cannot be the same number, which means our solution must be a combination of the 6  numbers. If 1 is placed in a cell, then we can only have 3, 6. If 6 is placed in a cell then we must have either 3 or 10. If 3 is placed in a cell the only other possibility is 10.

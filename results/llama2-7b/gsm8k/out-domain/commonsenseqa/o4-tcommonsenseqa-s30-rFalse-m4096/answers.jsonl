The first step is to identify the meaning of the word problem by reading the question. The second step is to state the question with a question mark. The next step is to read the question carefully to make sure that the question is clear and make a note of any information in the question that would be helpful to solve the question. The next step is too write the first assumption that is required to solve the question. This is followed by the solution to the question. Here is an example that shows the solution to \"How do you find 100% of a number?\" \"How do you find the percentage of a number?\" First step - identify the meaning of the question  Question - \"What is 100%?\"  Now Write the question with a question: \"What is 1.0?\"  Now Read the question carefully. Remember to make a note of any useful information in the question.   Next make the first assumption. Example: The question is What is 1.0?   100% of 100 is 100.  Solution: The question states that we want to find the percentage of a certain number. To find a number's percentage requires 2 values, i.e. the number itself and the number we want its percentage. To obtain the percentage of 1, we need 1 and we already have 1 itself, so the other value in the equation is 0.1. To find the percentage in decimal, write 0.1 as 0.1 * 100, and we get 0.1 *100 = 100 or (100/100)=1. This is how math works.

I decided to look up the term \"Traffic Light\", thinking I would find a program called \"traffic_light\", but instead I found an article with a similar name, this article said nothing about traffic lights. I looked up the term green-light because I thought maybe \"green-light\" might have something to do with the question. I found this Wikipedia Article. The answer was contained within the article and is below.\nGreen Light = the most flexible signal - the signal for 'go'\n\nA green traffic signal is a signal for 'go' to traffic.\n\nIf a road has more than one lane, which is marked by white lines and are separated by continuous white lines, the green light is for the lanes that are marked for a left turn, also known as a U-turn or a turning movement. The yellow light that comes before this green light is a signal that you need to prepare to turn, and the green light is telling you when to go. If you go before your green, there will be no one there and you may end up hitting a car turning in their lane.\n\nWhen you get to the white line, which is the start of the lane, stop moving.\n\nB.\n\nA red light is an indicator, or light, used to convey the meaning 'Stop' (or 'do not proceed') for anything on the road (typically a motor vehicle (such as a car, bus, or truck), including pedestrians and horses. Many red lights also indicate the signal to stop for emergency vehicles.\n\nBecause of road marking laws, if a red light is shown it must be obeyed. If a red light is being displayed, the vehicle, horse, or pedestrian must 'come to a complete and controlled stop', and wait one full cycle of the light. When the light is still red, the vehicle, horse or pedestrian must obey the signal. This is because if the signal was broken in some way, and the", "answer": " 11"}

In order to divide, you first multiply the first number by 100 (the first 4 in 435, this goes to 400 and 3 in 35). Then move the divisor one digit to the left (5). This leaves 3 digits in the dividend. Now you move to step 2.\nMultiply the three digits in the dividend (the last three in 435) by the divisor (5). This leaves you with 8 digits in the product. \nIn this case, the product is the quotient (the answer you are looking for). The 80 is the quotient, so this is multiplier. \nFinally, divide the 435 by the quotient. In this case, you have to divide by 100. Doing so, you end up with 4.35 (rounded).", "answer": " 5"}

If they flip until one doesn't turn up heads and the other doesn't turn up tails, the person will be determined to be human. If they flip the coins and end up hitting a tie, the person will be decided to be a robot. The person was given a $500 hand of blackjack and rolled double sixes with both flips. They asked for a second flip and the coin landed on a heads. If you know that that person is a robot, is the coin fair? (If the coin is fair or not can be determined by the following expression: (6/12) * (1/2) which equals 1/4)\nOutput: The coin is fair\n<br />\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/EugeneRoh/EugeneRahMath/blob/master/images/5.png\" style=\"zoom:50%;\">", "answer": " 247"}

So she threw her son up into a tree and climbed up after him. Now the tiger was 5 meters away! A man happened to notice them in the tree. She thought, \"I need someone to help us!\" So the man decided to climb into the tree. She thought that was brave. So the woman decided to climb out of the tree.\nOutput: Explanation: First the boy(or woman whoever climbed into the tree) would have had to make some sort of distance from the Tiger. However, since the Tiger is 5m away, that would mean that person(or Mother/son since they are in the tree) would have to be 4m or greater away from the tiger to put 2m distance between them and the tiger. So, in order to do this, mother or son would have to climb down to a height of 4m from the ground and climb back up to a height of 8m from the ground. They would not have to actually touch the ground since the tiger is between the two in proximity. Then, the man would have to climb up the tree from the ground and down from the tree back to the ground. He/she would then have to stand on the ground.\n# This was an easy one\n\nInput: The number 17 can be written 341 in base 4.

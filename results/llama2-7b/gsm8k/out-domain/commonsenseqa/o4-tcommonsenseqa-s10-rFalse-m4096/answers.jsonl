First, I add both Q and R to X, the carry digit in the bottom row.\n2. I then move the sum of the digits in the bottom row from X to it's corresponding place in the top row, from A. The carry of the 1 in A3 to A31.\n3. I then add Q1 and R1 from the bottom to top.\n4. I then take the digit sum of the top row (A from top to bottom) and subtract the sum of the bottom row (X from top to bottom). This gives me 1, which should be plugged into the corresponding place in the top. (A3).\n5. Repeat from #1 till all columns are done.\n\n#### B\n1. The first thing I do is take each digit of column B and set them as their own number. For instance, B1 will be left open since it has a dash. I will then take B2 and use it to set B1. To set B1 I'll take B1 again(since it's now empty). Then I will multiply B2 with B1.\n2. The same process will be done with each digit in the row below (e.i. B5, B6, etc.)\n3. Once I get all the digits of each column set I can take the sum of the digits for each column to the digit sum. I'll take B21 which is equal to the sum of all the digits in B2 (2). Then I'll subtract the digits in each column's sum from B21. This will give me my new digit sum.\n4. This process will be used with column A, C, D,", "answer": " 59"}

{"idx": 156, "text": "30 mangoes\n\n#### My approach:\n\n```\n1. Direction is to find out the solution of the given question.\n   Solution of the given question is determined by the number of options(choices)\n   that will make the question easy to solve.\n   \n2. For the above case one choice (B) is eliminated as it has no\n   relevance to the question. One choice is not a best fit to the above question.\n   \n3. All other choices are good to use, they will be used after some modifications.\n   \n 1. Modifiable: Modification of the wording that increases the clarity to the answer.\n        For the above case we have modifiable choices(choices) are: \"at what type of seller?\" -> \"where would you buy? \"\n        The question in the above case was clear to the user so we keep the choice as it is.\n      \n 2. Simplification: Simplification of the choice(choice) means removal of redundancy\n        For the above use we have only one choice(choice) need modification which is:\n \"at what type of tailor shop?\" -> \"in tailor shop\"\n        Now this choice is modified and it removes the redundancy of using the word \"tailor shop\" again.\n    \n 3. Shortening: shortening means reduction of the size that is given without removing the usefulness\n        For the below choice(s) the above choice is good so we have nothing to do with\n        the choice. We can only do one choice out of six choices to modify the choice.\n      \"at what type of garment\"?,    \"in garment shop?\",      \"which fabric is in sewing room?\"\n\n 4. Removal: removal means completely removing the unrelated information. For the case there\n     is no meaning of removing any information. It will effect negatively if we make\n     any changes.\n   \n 5. Reordering: The order of option(choices) which has a significant effect in the process of\n     the answer. We can change the question order according to the need to make the\n     solution clearer to the user.\n     We may change the order to avoid duplicate option\n      \n 6.

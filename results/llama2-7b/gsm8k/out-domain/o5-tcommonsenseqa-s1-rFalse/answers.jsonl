Be concise.\n\nInput: It was the beginning of a beautiful trip: the temperature was a moderate 78 degrees Fahrenheit; the breeze was strong and refreshing; the sun's warmth was soft and bright; there was no precipitation, in fact it was a lovely day. If it were a little cloudier, or a little bit cooler, it would have been the perfect hiking day.

She looked out over the peaceful lake and breathed in deeply as a light breeze blew warmly across her open face. Arlene awoke to find that, in her three hours of hike, she had only traveled 17.718 miles.\nOutput: It never even occurred...\n\nInput: What if you were a thriving plant, and you needed water?

He was standing in the aisle trying to decide which brand of potato chips to buy, a large bag of chips for $4 or small bag for $0.94? Which one would you choose and why John?\nOutput: \n\nJohn is always being a smart alec. \nWell first I would try to decide if there was any kind of difference between the two types of chips.\nAnd if I cannot determine the quality then I would probably go with the large bag. \nSure I would end up consuming more potato chips with the large bag but if I end up not using all of the potato chips then I am not really out any money since the price is cheaper. \nBut if I had to choose then I would say buy the large bag because you cannot go wrong with large bags of potato chips and how can one possibly eat only the small bag?", "answer": " 7"}

{"text": "17\n\n## Suggestion\n\nI have used an idea which was not original. The idea is to consider a sentence that contains keywords(like: the) in its words. Then based on this keyword, we can select a word from the sentence. The code is provided here: [Sentence_Tokenizer.c](https://github.com/HassanAbbasi9/DataStructuresandAlgorithms/blob/master/04TextSearchingandManipulation/06BasicSentenceManipulation01/Sentence_Tokeniser.c). \n\n### Discussion:\n\nI have used \"sow\" because we want to select a word and we can't select \"oil\". So \"sow\" is a keyword.\n \n### Solution:\n\nHere are the steps:\n\n1-I used C to get a random integer.\n\n2-I separated the input by space. \n\n3-I separated the input words by space.\n\n4-I separated the input with comma. \n\n5-I did loop here. \n\n6-I used the output to the input again (to select an element from an array).\n\n7-This is the first instruction. so I have added one and one. So in the end I got: 1+2+3+4+5+6+7 = 20.\n\n8-Now I have used 20 as the second number of the second instruction.\n\n9-I have called the second instruction from the first instruction.\n\nNow let's see what is the main idea of the main part of this program. we use the first part of the program as inputs. We put the outputs in an array and we iterate between their index and their name. So we do this:  \n\n    while( i < a[n].length) \n    {\n        if( (a[n].[i] == a[n].[i+1]) && (a[n].i < a[n].l + 1) )", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "E: $4\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the above question.\n\nIn this section, we will see what \"programming\" is by writing down a simple \"Hello, World\" program and run it in a development environment. In a C/C++, we print Hello, World to the STDOUT stream which can be viewed by pressing  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> while the program is still running. On Windows, you can use both command prompt and PowerShell to execute programs. In Linux, you can use shell to execute programs (a similar thing as \"cmd\" in Windows). \n\n```c\n#include {\n    #include <iostream>\n    #include <stdio.h>\n    using namespace std;\n}\n\n\n\nint main ()\n{\n    //cout << \"Hello, World!\";\n    printf(\"Hello, World!\");\n\n    \n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n# Tutorial 2: Hello, World in a different programming language\n\nHello, World! is the first program for any programming language. This program is simple to understand and also demonstrates our understanding of the syntax of the programming language. It does not matter if you are writing code in C-like programming language, or in DSL-like programming language, hello, world should be the program you write first.\n\nIn this chapter, we will see what can be done in \"Hello, World\" programs if we use functional programming language. The most important point to note is that all variables we create must be immutable. \n\n```haskell\nmain :: IO ()\nmain = [print $ \"Hello, world!\"]\n```\n\nOr, without using Haskell prelude:\n\n```haskell+functional\nmain :: IO () \n-- | Hello world in Functional Programming\nmain = [print \"Hello, world!\"]\n```\n\n> [print $ \"Hello World!\"; print \"Hello World!\";] -> Printing statements in a sequence\n\nWe have printed `Hello, World!` in a different fashion. If we print it three-times, we can get: \n\n```h\n1. Hello, World!\n2. Hello, World! \n3. Hello, World! ```\n\n![](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&r", "answer": " 15"}

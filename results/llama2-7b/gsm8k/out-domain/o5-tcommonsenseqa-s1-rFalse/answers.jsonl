We can then also find the total number of children in a family. We can then subtract the number of girls from the total number of children. We can then remove each boys fraction from the total number of boys. Then we can then add the total number of boys to the total amount of money given to boys and divide by the number of boys.\n2.What feedback would you give the writer to make the solution easier to read?\n-\n* Write the input for the statement, with the correct spacing and punctuation.\n* You may also add the input as part of your solution, although it may be clearer if you write the input as an example rather than as part of the solution.\n\n\n### Conclusion\n- You did pretty good with this exercise.\n#### **Next steps:**\n- Keep trying these tutorials with your father and get him to help you aswell.\n- As you get better at writing more complex algorithms, write some of them on your own.

What is the probability you get different results on the two die?\n\n### Demosntrations:\nInput: There is a 66% probability you get different results.\n\n### Inputs:Two different dice are rolled.

There is a probability of 77% you get different values.\n\n### Response :There is a probability 57 of you getting different values, for all three input events.\n\n### Rational:Out of 2 possible dice, each one will throw a six with 6% probability. With 2 dice rolled, there is a 6/24 * 1/24 probability of getting 6 sixes if all 6 are in the same box. This is not a possible outcome for either of the dice, but there is a 58% chance out of the possible 25, that the dice will throw different sixes 25/25 * 57/25. Another way of thinking of this:if you try 1000 times, you will only get the same dice 994 times, with only a 6% chance of the same dice out of all 1000 repetitions.\n\n### Notes:Another way of saying this is a 57% chance for the two dice to produce different 6's.\n\n### Example:Another way of describing this without using the word \"dice\", it's the same as a sample size of 1 from a set size of 10.

I know this solution works because, I solved it myself, but I was only a few grades into elementary school, probably third grade or so. At the time, I thought I was pretty good at puzzles and riddles, but I can't even imagine how someone could really use this solution at all in the future. I've seen these same kinds of riddles before, and I feel like they are a thing that some employers and school programs like to use to test the deductive reasoning skills of applicants and students, but I haven't heard a story or seen a situation where this kind of reasoning was ever necessary, or even useful to somebody in an actual work setting. I just learned this on my own about a decade ago, but what I've learned in the intervening years is that most of the things we're taught in elementary school and middle school aren't exactly usable when we get older. Even the things we use, in practice, are a small set of skills, and the math and science that we are taught in the elementary and middle schools are mostly useless, and the thing that I have realized most of all is that the most useful things that any of us learn in school, are the skills that we learn outside of class, and the skills that we use to learn things on our own.\n\n### Feedback:\nI learned a lot from this activity and how to effectively respond to it.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Faith went to the bakery and she bought flour that cost 5$ and a cake stand 28$. We can begin to solve this equation by adding the cost of the flour plus the cake stand to the amount she paid the cashier. Flour = 5 and a cakeStand = 28 $= $33. She then gave the caisier 20$ and 3$. Whenever you receive 20s and give the cashier 20s, then you do not get any change. She then gets 3$ in change. She therefore pays $30 because the 3 $ in change is counted as 9$.\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Addition:\n\n### Subtraction:\n\n### Multiplication:\n\n### Division:", "answer": " 10"}

A plastic cup with a larger mouth will easily pick up water that has dripped from the drinking cup in the process. The plastic cup's mouth will not get clogged up with the water at any point because its' mouth is larger.\n\n### Solution: \n`\nThe answer for the first part was '1,2,4,8'. \nSo, the answer for the second part must have a similar answer that is '1,6,12,24'. \nSo, let's try this : 4 + 6 = 10, and since 4 doubles to 8, so the number of kittens in the 10th bale equals the number of kittins in the 4th bale. The number of kittens increases by 2 by every stage in the process.

An alligator is a meal that you would eat whole, but that is not always the case. For example, alligators are more likely to prefer smaller meats than larger ones. This means that you should be more careful when cooking them and they will be more likely to be eaten from the larger sizes. It is also possible that all of your favorite meats, such as steak and vegetables, may be cooked and combined into a single meal and then all of your other options may be taken away.\n\n#### Input\n\n> As you said, I prefer to be more careful when cooked. In addition, I would be more likely to eat from the larger sizes since these are usually more flavorful because they are prepared in more flavorful recipes. So for me, yes I would prefer to eat from the smaller sizes so that I had more options available to me. The smaller sizes were also often more affordable since they were prepared in more cost effective recipes.\n\n\n#### Response\n\nMy favorite meats are beef and vegetables, so I think that would be the best way to go.\n\nI would probably go with a combination of alligator meat, seafood, and vegetables.\nAlligator is much more flavorful that what I ate when we were young and vegetables are very inexpensive so it's a great choice.\n\n#### Input:Which one of the two dishes would you prefer to eat? Would you rather eat pizza without a crust, or a sandwich?\n\n#### Response:The crustless sandwich (the crust off the sandwich) is much better to eat because it's a much better tasting sandwich. The more tasteful option is the crustless version. It's not like the sandwich is without a crust it has a crust so it's a good option.\n\n\n#### Input:In which of the following ways would choosing either of my choices improve", "answer": " 46"}

If an error occurs, you will get the error displayed in the deployment summary. If everything works you will get a deployment summary telling you that the deployment completed successfully.\n\n### What are the errors that can occur using the CDK?\nThere are several possibilities. Here is a list:\n\n- Failed to deploy the stack. This usually happens if your solution is not functioning\n- The stack does not have an output that contains the result expected by the test-tool\n- The output does not match the expected output. This is mainly when you use a CDK dependency that has several version requirements. For example, you can use a CDK dependency, but use the wrong versions.\n- When using cdk deploy, a permission error occurred.\n\nIf you get this", "answer": " 2240"}

{"text": "The formula for conversion from inches to gallons: 1 inch =.5 gal\nThe formula for conversion gallons to money: 1 gallon = $1.2\n\nSo for each gallon I need to multiply.75 (because 50% of a gallon is.75)  Then I can subtract.75 because that's the number of gallons (or.75 gallons times.75 to convert back to inches =.625 inches)  Finally, times the money to get the sales price. So for 4 inches rain we need.625 x.75 x 1.2 = $1.50  However, because we can only sell all the water because we only got 3 inches rain $1.2 x.75 x.625 = $0.60\n\n### Demostration:\nLet's find out the formula for converting between inches and gallons: 1.0 inches =.0833 gal 1.0 gal =.878 inch\n\n### Input\nThe formula to use is:\n3 in= 2.4788 gal $1.20\n1/2 in =.833 gal $2.49\n.5 in =,75 gal $1.60\n.75 in = 0.625 gal $1.50\n1.0 in =.878 gal $1.49\n\nSo we have:\n3/2 in (use 1 in for gallons)= 6.5 gal $8.40\n2 1/2 in (use.5 in gallons)= 3.3 gal $2.98\n3 in (use.75 in gallons)= $3.25\n2 in (use.878 gal gallons)= $4.60\n2 12/2 in (use. 3 in and.5 in gallons) = $5.32 because of the $1.60 conversion for 1 1/2 in\n\nA total of $36.60\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/jaredrourke/Grade9JaredRourke.github.io/blob/master/assets/2017-", "answer": " 126"}

Lisa had 5 pens and if all four pens were black and Lisa had no colored pens of any other kind she would know she has 4 pens. Pens would still be greater than 4. Mary said that Lisa had 3 pens before Lisa made them disappear. That would mean that Lisa must also have had pens that weren't black so she lied. Mary knows Lisa's pen colors because she could ask.

If it stops at 12:34 am, 4 minutes early, how long was there from the time they left the station to when the bus arrived at the work place?\n### Response:  892 mins because the first person to get on the bus is 5 mins before it leaves and the bus had 55 passengers so 110 mins between the first and last person.  The bus stopped late and Mary walked at a moderate pace between the station to her work for 4 minutes so it was 196 mins between the station and work.

{"text": "It seems the answer to this problem is 274 eggs. (7) eggs Tank gathered in round one. (10) eggs Emma gathered in round one. The total number of eggs collected after round one was 110 eggs. (The difference between the totals of the two rounds.) In addition, Tank gathered 20 fewer eggs in round two for a total of 40 eggs. Emma, however, gathered 60 eggs. Adding the total collection of eggs from both rounds yields 150 eggs. The 3rd round involved 6 other people. 400 divided by 7 is 57.5. 57.5 rounds to collect 60 eggs is 57 + 5 = 62. Adding the 150 and 62 would yield 212 eggs. Round four involved Tank. 20, because he gathered 20 eggs fewer than round three. Therefore Tank gathered 62 eggs. Emma gathered 60 in round three. Adding Emma's 60 eggs to Tank's 62 yields 122. Additional maths show the grand total to be 400 rounded to two decimal places equal to 122 eggs. If the number in round three had consisted of an odd number of eggs rather than an even number, the grand total would have equal an even number of eggs instead.", "answer": " 220"}

{"text": "In Sally's Woodworking LLC's records, a single piece of furniture cost $134. This means that 150 pieces will cost the company $20,710. If Sally is reimbursing Remy, then she would overcharge $30. This means that she would take $20,740, then remove an additional $30, meaning $20,770.\n\n### Explanation:If you subtract the price of furniture from the total amount, you will come up with an estimate.\n\n### Input 2:Brady had a 700-gallon gas tank at a full service gas station filled by a single pump. If a single fillup pumped the tank 1% slower than the nozzle, what would take the extra gas-time to get him by the next time he returned? Choices: 1: 7 hr 2: 7 min 3: 7 sec 4: 0.7 sec 5: 0.7 minutes\n\n### Response 2:The pump was 1% faster, so it took Brad 700/(100-1%) = 708 seconds to fill, so divide this by 1 which would take the entire time. That would mean it would take 708 seconds or roughly 12 minutes to fill the tank.\n\n### Influences:\n\n### Hints:\n* Think of a percent of your time that you can take (1%)\n* Subtract 1 from 100 (100-1=99)\n* Divide your time by this number to get your answer.\n\n### Questions:\n### Demonstartion Question:\nIn your previous example why can't you take 0.1% because it's different between 0.1% and 1%?\n\n### Inuctions Question:\nWhy does 700 need to be divided by (100-0.1) instead of (100-.1)? It's just going from 700% to 700-(0.1)*100, shouldn't it be a difference of 700/(0.9) *10", "answer": " 600"}

{"text": "There are 6 audiobooks, each is 30 hours long. So the total time to finish the six audiobooked is 360 hours or 86 days.\n\n### Evaluation: There were 6 audiobooks to finish, and each book lasts 30 hours. It takes her 2 hours to finish each book. To solve for when she could finish her final book, she needed to solve for the x in the equation 2x=30. This will give her the number of hours she needs to finish the final audiobook. This number would be x= 15 hours. We now know it will take her 15 hours to finish the final book. To solve for the total number of hours, we can use the rule of the distributive property (x-1x). x-1x= 6x and we can cancel the x's so we have (6x-1)=6. You can multiply 6x on the left side and (-1)x on the right. (6x)(-1x)= -1. 6x= 6(1). So 6x= 21. Now that we know the total number of hours needed, we will just multiply 6x, 30. 6x (30)=180 hours. So Fernanda needed 180 total hours to listen to all of the audiobooks.", "answer": " 90"}

For example, a spreadsheet that takes several minutes is likely more advanced than a spreadsheet that takes only a few seconds. We can describe advanced features by finding an average spreadsheet creation time. Which would be a better way to complete to average spreadsheet creation time: to compare to the time it takes to make each different spreadsheet or to combine the time it takes to create the spreadsheet with the time it takes to complete all the advanced features in a spreadsheet? Explain your answer.\n\n### Solution: It is better to 1) compare the time it takes to finish each example spreadsheet, and 2) combine the average time it takes to finish the spreadsheet and the average time to finish all the spreadsheets with advanced features.  By combining the time it takes to use the spreadsheet, it gives us a fair comparison.  By just making each spreadsheet and stopping once we think we've seen an advanced spreadsheet, we could be leaving out some advanced features that may still only take a few seconds to use.  This will give us a better average time to finish our spreadsheet.", "answer": " 96"}

{"text": "45 miles\n\nInput: If I could learn to work efficiently all day, how long would an ordinary day (without learning to work efficiently) last me based on my pace?\n\n### Demostration:If it rained for 6 hours. A=6(6) If it rained for 4 (2x2)=8 If it rained for a=2 hours. (4x4)=16 If it rained for b=4 hours. (4x6)=24 70. If it rained for x hours, x(x+2)=96 If it rained 2 hours longer than 6, x=3. 3(x+2)=24 +a(x+a)=36. If it rained 3 hours 4 minutes longer than 6, then x=3.30.36=24.36/36= 70.15 minutes.

I had to just work on each individual word to find the correct answer. This is an area where I feel that I need to improve upon is coming up with the answers that work on the spot.  It seems as though there are some instances where no matter what word you put together it simply do not make sense.  This is one reason that I can see myself not understanding some math problems and other areas of education.  While math may have formulas that can be used to solve it, English is not as clear as that.  There are times when you can not use a word to another word.  You have to think of it in different ways to find the correct word to use.  This is an area that I can work on to become stronger.", "answer": " 5"}

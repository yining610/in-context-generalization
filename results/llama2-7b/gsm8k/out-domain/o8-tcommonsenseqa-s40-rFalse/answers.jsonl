{"text": "10 pages\n\n**Solution:**\n\nI spent a significant amount of time pondering \"what would the programmers expect?\"\n\nI wanted to answer all but the most obscure and strange, and do so in a way that didn't sound contrived or ridiculous.\n\nAfter some time, I decided to focus on the general \"sense\" of the question, and not on the specific words. This is key, because many words are synonymous with others, but you can tell the question writer, by their word choices, what they are *looking for* when they use a specific term.\n\nIn the first example, for instance, they are clearly looking for \"thorough,\" but not \"complete, \"detailed,\" nor even \"thoroughly.\" \n\nSimilarly, they expect \"express yourself\" from the second, \"create art\" from the third, \"poor workmanship\" from the fourth.\n\nThus, I decided to attempt to answer these questions in as few words as possible. If they expected more than 5 words from me, no dice. I wanted to hit the key word in every question, so I had to learn the specific vocabulary.\n\nBecause of my general focus on specifics for vocab, it turned out that nearly every question had a specific word that was the only 5-word answer in the entire thing.\n\nSo, the trick was to figure the key vocab for what they were looking for, then pick the right phrase that hit the 5-word mark. In fact, it was almost too specific and technical in vocab. As such, the final output is fairly close, as if the answerer had been someone from a very high ranking profession who knew specific vocab very well.\n\nIt may have been possible to pick up even a wider variety of words had I chosen. But for the first 5 of these, it was all I could do to stay inside 5 words. \n\nFor the last, I decided a 6th word would work, and I'd lose a tiny bit of precision. \n\nOn the whole, it was a fun challenge to do these questions.\n\n### Instruction: What is the next number in the series?\n\nInput: 10,15, 20, 23, 24\nOutput:", "answer": " 42"}

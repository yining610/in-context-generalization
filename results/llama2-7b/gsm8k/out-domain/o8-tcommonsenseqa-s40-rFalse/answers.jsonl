The `while True` pattern should only be used if the code inside it is meant to run only once, and is often used in cases where there is some type of infinite loop that runs forever. In your case, you have created a new file every time the function is run, which is not what you want to happen.\n\nInstead, you want to run the file only once, and not run the do_your_work function in a loop. You'd also want to fix the way you call the do_your_job method. The current code tries to call the function inside a local variable `do_your_job()`. This won't work (and you get an \"unbound method\" error message as a result). What needs to happen is `do_your_work()` needs to be called as a function.\n\nI can't properly show you how to do this without seeing specific data, but I'll point you in the right path. The python docs on functions ([here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#function-definitions)) indicate that each file that has a do_your_work method can only call it with the signature do_your_work(some_file_data). You should think about trying to use the data stored in other files you have written using the `with` statement before you even get to your do_your_work() method, and not just rely on the `with` statement when you do have data.\n\nYou don't want to end up using the `while True` structure when you do your own code. You want to think about using it from a separate file if other code makes a call to", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Kate bought 126 red bouncy balls more than yellow bouncy ball.\n\n### Input A: Kangaroo: Kangaroos jump because they're used to their feet being pulled up with a very high acceleration, rather than being pushed off the ground.

When those feet strike the ground, they quickly pivot and keep speeding forward, propelling the kangaroo forward with a long, bounding jump.

{"text": "50 pounds.\n\n\n\n(The challenge is written as a markdown flavored plaintext)\nIt's been a while since I did a challenge like this, mostly because it takes up a big chunk of time to complete and I don't often have the time.   Luckily, I happened to see this recently and I had something to work on.\n\nMy approach was to try to create a REPL environment, so that I would not need to type out answers to each particular problem individually.  Creating and using the `python -i` command worked as a rudimentary REPL, and with some minor adjustments, I was off to the races.\n\nIt occurred to me, that if this `python -i` line can be put in a more permanent place, that I could write my own REPL as a command line tool, and the challenge would be just a matter of providing the input (in a given format).\n\nThe actual REPL I eventually wrote is very rough around the edges, and only does basic arithmetic on integers.  It's a very simple example of how one might go about creating their own REPL-like tool.  \n\nI had a few minor issues with formatting.  For instance, the input and output are formatted in a way that makes things a bit difficult to read, however, after writing the REPL, I had created it on a Windows machine, and copying it over to my Linux server, I had to fix some of character escaping that was messed up.  This wouldn't be a problem if I'd done it from linux, but I made a few additional adjustments to make things even simpler.\n\nThe REPL tool (to copy-paste straight into windows) looks like this:\n\n    /#\n    0 + 1 = 0\n    1 + 5 (enter) = 6\n    (10 - 9) / 2 = 5\n    (5 * 2) / 10 = 0.5\n\n    The result is an int or float (i.e, a number)\n\n    /# exit\n\n### My REPL is designed for plaintext input and output.  It does basic arithmetic operations on integers, and returns an integer result.  It's very primitive.\n\n### My task from the challenge is as follows:\nThere are two tasks for you to", "answer": " 34"}

{"text": "The garden can be divided into three equal parts. That can be done by the mathematical formula of 64 divided by three and then add 3.33 (58 in 6's) to the answer of 3.33.  Then you divide the answer by two to get the correct answer.\n\n### Response 2:\nJoel's answer to the first question is 71.5 feet. Then Joel can divide the total square feet of fruits left by 72 and multiply by 4, which gives him a total of 283. Joel can do the same with the vegetable square feet and multiply by 4 which gives him a total vegetable square feet of 728.\n\nJoel now takes his remaining 48 square feet that remain and divides by 4, which yields two pieces, each 44 square feet each. Multiply 44 by two, and the resulting area equals 88 square feet.\n\nSo your answer is two sections of fruit, each with a quarter of Joel's fruit square feet, plus two sections of vegetable of the same size each.", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Hannah has 20 bananas. She needs 20 cups of mush for 3 cups each for banana bread. She can get 20 cups by making 10 mounds 2 high (the 3rd cup will be the one on top of the 10th). Each mound requires 4 bananas. Therefore, she has to make 40 mounds to get enough banana mush. To get 20 cuppers, she needs 20 mounds. In the end, she needs 2 mounds 10 times. 1. Divide 10 into 2 to get the number of mounds. 2. Divide 40 into 2 to find out how many mounds of banana mush should be made. 3. Double both numbers to get the number of times each mound should be made. 4. Multiply the number of mounds in step 3 by the number of bananas per mound to get the number of bananas she needs. The answer is 800. 1 mound is 2 cups, and 3 cups per mound will make 6 cups. To make 20 cups you need 20/6=3.33mounds. 5. Multiply that number by the number of bananoas she needs, which is 800/6=133.3 mounds of banana.\n\nI think this is correct because I used the same techniques as 4th-grade math when finding the answer. The only difference is I needed to find out what a mound was  and how much bananas there are in one cup of mush so I had to double everything.

Your focus should be more on the algorithm and less on the output.\n\nI like that you are working really hard, but your work is more on the surface level, instead of on a higher level. \n\nWhat you need to do next is to make the computer do something without your help. \n\nIn other words, try to write your code without looking at the output.  This is what will help you grow. \n\nI think you are already working on that as you are making the output match the instructions that are given for the input.\n\nI think this is what is missing. \n\nA great next step would be to work on an algorithm so it works without any help from the output.  Make it algorithmic like this:\n\n```\nlet(X=4) if(X>19) X=X-20\n```\n\nFor example, let's say you try to make a calculator. The output would look like this: \n\n``You need to add 10 to the input``\n\nI think you should try \n\n``You can input the number 10``\n\nThen the program would have to add 10, without any help. \n\nKeep working on it.

It is made of 3 different colors. He only has 4 balls of yarn that each represent a different color. What can you do to re-knit the sweater from the original yarn?\n\n### Demostration:\n- I have a yellow ball of yarn, a purple ball of yarn and two more colors that I don't know to choose from yet. Each ball of yarn represents a different color. \n\nIf I only have those three, then I am left one of the colors undecided- which is not a helpful situation. \n\nSo I decide to look at it this way: since the sweater is 3 colors, and I have 3 different yarn balls, I can assume which color is which simply by counting. \n\nThe blue colored one is my purple, and there are 3 of them.\nThe green is my yellow, and there are 4 of them.\nThe red one is my other color- and there are 3 (or one left over).\n\n### Input\n- It turns out that I still have one extra ball of yarn lying around. I have my purple (3), green (4) and red (3) so when the sweater is done I will have 1 ball of yarn left, because each ball represents one color out of three. \n\nBy following this logical pattern, I would have to have 1 ball of one color, and a 2-1 ratio for the rest.\n\n### Response\n- I solve this problem by making the red and green colors each half as much yarn as the others, which gives me a 2-1 ration at the end. (There is one unused color (red) and the green and purple colors are a little less than the amount that the blue and purple colors were). \n\n### Input \n- Now I will do the next half of the sweater:\nI now need 2 balls of purple, because", "answer": " 3"}

If it took 20 seconds to travel 210 ft, the cheetah would then be 210 + 120 + 20 = 350 ft from the gazelle after 20 seconds; this means the gazelle would've traveled 210 ft in the 20 seconds after the cheetah had traveled 350 ft.

The question is in the top left of this webpage.\n\n-There are a few things to note about the question here. First, it is not necessarily talking about all of the math students, as there is no mention of percentages of class size, percentages of students that have completed a similar assignment or the difficulty of the question. We can infer that the question is asking what the total assignment completion percentage would be, not the completion percentage of how many students did this question compared to how many total students did not do it.\n\n-The percent increase is.19 because, when we figure in how many days the students have done it on, we see that out of a ten day assignment, only 5 days were actually assigned to do the assignment. That means 50% of your assignment was complete in 5 days (50%). That means the students are 50% finished with your assignment. Now, add 50% with the percent increase (A).

{"text": "A hot air baloon can float to the distance from the place where it starts at 35,000 feet to reach the top of the Earth's atmosphere, which is 200,000 feet. It would take over 4 hours to use your math to determine how many of the total balloons are left. You need to estimate that it takes half an hour to use all 200 baloons. Half of the 200 baloon have blown up in the first half hour so therefore you need to multiply the hours it took to use those 100 balloons by 20 to get the total number of baloons that remain intact. Here is a equation I found, it may help you to solve this problem, it equals half: n* t +(1/2)*(n -t). Example, you need 21/2 hours to use 108 balloons. 21/2*20 = 120 balloons left.\n\n### Input and instruction:\nA car is moving at 64 mph on the highway. This speed is just a little higher than 10 mph over the speed limit. If the driver needs to make a 15 mile journey, how long will it take?

Multiply that by 30 km/hour which equals 300 which is how many minutes it will take to cover 15 miles, or 24 km.\n\n\n### Input\nAn airplane is flying at 750 km per hour.

{"text": "I see this task as being in the form of the sum of two fractions. Let's call the two denominators D and D', and the two numerators N and N'.  As D=5 and D'=1 we can see that D'<D since they're divided by 5.  So we use the \"rule of addition,\" which is that when you have fractions with like denominators,  \nthe sum is found by changing fractions into the reciprocals of their denominators and then adding. So we get that 5N'.   \nNext we have that N/D'<N'/D, which means that the sum must be 5/D'.   \nNow we need a way to convert D' and D into multiples of 2, preferably in a way that allows us to use our calculator (if it supports a fraction property key). In other words, we need to convert them into something like (20/10) and (20/12), so that we can simplify and get a sum that is easy for a calculator to evaluate.  \nSo we have (20/11), and (20/4).

Your response consists of three parts: the request specification, your interpretation of the request, and the response.\n\n## Task:\n\nCreate a parser that will create an object that has a method \"solveRequest\" which can handle your requests.\n\n### Description of the Task:\n\nCreate an object called \"parser\" that can answer any question asked of it.  This problem requires two main structures: a parser and a request class.  The \"parser\" class contains a function that takes a request as a parameter, that function is supposed to be able to create an object that understands the request and returns an appropriate response (one of the possible responses).  To create a parser you should find a way to take input that has two properties:  information about a question and an answer to that question.  This information is a tokenized string.  The parser is supposed to look through the input string and determine the category of the input string (question or answer or nothing).  It is also supposed to extract the parts of the string that belong to each of those category.  Then the parser will use the extracted question and the extracted answer to create an object that will be able to answer the request.  The object is created using a method like \"solveRequest\" that takes a request as an input parameter.  It also has a private method called \"getRequest\" which will be used by the method \"solveRequest\".  This method will take the string parameter and return a Request object.  \n\n### Solution Procedure:\n\nBefore attempting this problem it is suggested that you complete the practice problems below.  \n\n## Practice Problems:\n\n![Practice Problem 1](practice-problem-1.png)", "answer": " 22"}

So, the 24 clocks would be equal to 4.  Next, we can convert Chapter 11 into paragraphs as Chapter 11 times twelve equals 131 paragraphs, which gives us twenty.  One plus two equals three.  Afterward, we convert one hundred forty paragraphs into pages, which equals forty.  We have now calculated that Mitchell read altogether, thirty-nine paragraphs.  For one point, a paragraph equals four quantities.  Adding the total number of paragraphs, we have 141.  Because they are not a simple fraction, we know that these numbers must be added.

{"text": "There may be some ambiguity around the word half.  The first time we are told he takes a whole pizza, which we presume to be two halves.  Then the next time we are told he cuts it in half, which would be 40 slices.  We could assume that Lard cuts 1 pizza into two halves.  If he chooses this pizza over taking another half, then he would cut the whole pizzas into 2 halves which would be half the first half, and half the second half.  The number of slices in a whole pizza is 2 * 40 which is 80 pepperoni slices.  In this case, we can divide that into 2 because the pizza was cut into two halves, giving 2 * 4 * 40 = 160 pepperoni slics.  Then once he cuts the whole thing into halves, that is 4 slices.  So he ends up with 2 * 4 = 8 slices.  After he gives one slice to jelly, he has a 7-slice pepperoni sliced pizza that he keeps for himself.\n\n### Input : The dog in the front yard was barking.

{"text": "Lavinia\u2019 son is 6 years older than Lavinia\u2019 daughter\n\n### Instructions:Answer each question.\n\n## 3. How can I add two numbers whose product is a prime number?\n\nThe answer is: (a +b) = p. Prime number p can't be divided by any other number. We can start with (a + b)^2 = p. It will be (a+b)^2 = p. So, add 2 and we will get p. If p is a prime number, the method will be: p = (a+b)^(2*2). We will get (a+b)^4 by multiplying 2*(2). (a+b)^k will be the power of both (a+b). For example, if a+b = 6, we will get the product 36 as (6+6)^k.\n\n## 4. How can I add an odd and even number?\n\nThe sum of odd number and even number is even number. We can get the result by subtracting one from odd number or adding one to even number. If it is less than 100, we can do this. If it is more than 100 with two digits, we can convert numbers into two more digits after thousand. So, we will get a two digits number. Then we can do simple addition or simple subtraction.\n\n## 5. How can I add large numbers whose digits are separated by two digits?\n\nThe sum can be got by adding two digits. If two digits of bigger number are twice two digits of smaller number, we will get twice sum of bigger two digits minus twice sum of smaller two digits. If two numbers are in even times of each other, that is, if two numbers are multiplied by two, it will double sum. (Example, if we can sum 101 + 102, the problem is the same with 210 + 211.)\n\n## 6. How can I calculate the volume of a solid cube as a function of the sides in the cube?\n\nLet's say we have a cube and its sides are 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. So, the area of the cube is (1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5).

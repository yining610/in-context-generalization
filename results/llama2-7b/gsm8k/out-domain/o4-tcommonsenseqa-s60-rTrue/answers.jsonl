{"text": "1) This is a math quiz, so the answer will lie in solving a mathematical equation. 2) The input states that Julie reads 12 pages yesterday and today she read twice as many as yesterday. This means she might have read either 24 pages or 36 pages (half of the pages she read yesterday). 3) But since the input states that she wants to read half the remaining pages, she would have to read the number of pages that are not twice as many as yesterday's pages. And in this time, we can say that the input has given us the number of pages that she read today. 4) So, we can substitute the number of pages that were completed by Julie today, for the variable of \"x.\" 5) And the input states that Julie wants to read half the pages remaining, so she needs to find out the value to which \"x\" needs to be divided by 2. 6) So, the equation will be, half page read + half page read = 36 6) Therefore, 36 + x = 72 7) Then, x = 36 9) Thereafter, the answer would be, Julie should read 36 pages.\nSo the final answers is 36 pages \n\nInput: If you bought 2 pizzas for $20 total, what would you pay for each?

The question asks for the cost of three candles.\n2. We can subtract the total cost of each candle from the grand total of the candles to find their relative prices.\n3. First, let's calculate the cost for one candle: subtract $2.00 from $7.00 to get $5.00. This means that each individual candle costs $5.00\n4. Next, let's calculate for each candle (two) using the steps we calculated above: $5.00 - $2.00 = $3.00 for each individual candle.\n5. Now, let's multiply each individual candle price by the number of individual candles in the set: $3.00 x 2 = $6.00 for each candle\n6. Therefore, adding $6.00 to $5.00 for the first set of candles and $6.00 x 3 to $5.0-0 for the second set of candles gives us $6.00 + $5", "answer": " 36"}

If the shop owner plans to make a profit of 25% on all sales, in what range of prices would such a shop make the most profit overall?\n\nOutput:\nSolution: Let 'c' be the common number to be multiplied to all the given prices for making a profit of 20% by selling all 4 bicycles. Now we need three numbers which when multiplied with one 'c' equal to 20% of the individual price of each bicycle. 3 numbers which when multiplied will give us 20% for an equation in slope-intercept form is: 20=3x+b.\n\nNow, 25 is 5% more than 20. Hence, when we solve the equation we need to add 5% or 5/100. The value of one 'c' is added to all the prices and 3% to the overall profit percentage. This value can be added to all the already added one 'c' to each price and 3% of the overall profit percentage. The final values will be: $682.50, $812.50, and $414.50. Hence, the answers lies between $682. 50 and $812. 50.\nSo the final range is between $682 and $812 in dollars.", "answer": " 60"}

{"text": "1) First, calculate the number of red hats Paityn has. (Paityn has 3 more red hats than Zola, so she has 3 + (4/5) red hats. The total number of blue and red hats she has is 24, which means Paityn has (24 + 24 - 3) + 4/5 (24) = 29 red hats and 3 blue hats.\n2) Now it's easy to find the total number of hats. Just multiply 29 by 6 to get the total number of hired and share it equally to get: Zola-10 and Paityn-9. Zola and Paity have 10 hats each.\n3) The number of hats Zola has is equal to Paity's number because they are each going to be given 1/2 (or 50%) of their original hats. However, the number of hats in each group is not equal because Zola has twice as many blue hats as red ones. Therefore, they will divide the number of hats that is Zola's by 2, getting Zola-5 and Paityn-4.5\n4) There are no more hats for them to share because they gave Zola twice as many blue hates as she had, and Paityn got one less than she did.\nSo the final total number of hats is 40, making Zola get 20 red hated and 10 blue hate. Paityn also gets 20 red hates and 12 blue hates.\nSo the final answers are Zola gets 20/2=10 red hats and blue hates, and Paityn 20/2.5=8 red hats and 12 blue one's.", "answer": " 54"}

The formula for calculating the total number of fish needed to feed the second tank would be = volume in the second tank (72 gallons) divided by the volume of each fish (1 gallon).\n2. The formula for calculating total number of fish needed for the first tank would be = total volume in both tanks (120 gallons) divided by total volume of the fish in the second tank (14 gallons).\n3.

On the second day, the company paved 1 mile less than it did on the first day, so it took 2  truckloads of asphalto pave this amount of road.\n6. Therefore the total number of truckloads needed to pave 4 miles of road is 3.\n7. On the third day, the company will need to pave 4 - 1 = 3 miles, so it needs 3  truckloads to pile new asphalts to complete the work.\n8. So, the final answer is 3  truckload of asphalts. \nSo the final answer: 3  trucks of asphalts for 4 miles of road\n\nInput: A new bicycle costs \u00a3160 and its components cost \u00a370 and sales tax will be \u00a317.

{"text": "1) We need to first determine the cost of apples and bananas per dozen according to these two sets of purchases. 2) By adding the total for each column, we have our answer of $1.02 for a dozen. The total cost of a dozen is the sum of the values in each column. 3) A bunch of bananas costs $0.18. That means each individual banana costs $0.12.\n4) When we look at per-bunch cost of bananas, the cost is $0.18, or 1.80. In this same light, the cost of apple is $0.68, or 6.80.\n5) So, a bunch of bananas costs 1.80 times less than a bunch of apples (0.18 compared to 6.80).\n6) Therefore, the cost of bananas per bunch is $0.12, while the cost of apples per bunch is $078.

A customer buys 7 pairs for $29. What is the discount rate?\nOutput:  This question is about finding the discount rate of a store when a customer buys 7 pair of gloves for $29 which was $30 original price. \n\n1. The discount rate is 4% and the answer is $1.\n2. In this question, we are given a set of price. Therefore, we need to find the discount rate.\n\n3. The discount rate = (10/(7*30)-1)/30 = 4%.\n4. \"A store offers 10 pair of gloves for 30\" means the original price of gloves is $30 and the store sells 10 pair for that price.\n5. If you bought 7 pair, it means by 10% less than the original price. \"10(100-7)/100 = 4%.\"\n6. The store offers 10 glove for $30/100 = $0.30. If you buy 7 gloves for $0.30, you save $0.30 x 7/10. This should be done to the original price. This way give you that the discount rate is $30 x 10/30 = $1. \n7.

From the table, we can see that 4/5 + 1 = 6/6, which means she has 6/6 of the cupcakes. When dividing two fractions and fractions that are not common are cancelled.\n3] The last step is to find how much is the 1/6 left after 1/6 is divided by 6/6. When the fractions are divided again, there's 5/3 left, which has a common denominator of 1. Hence, Anna has 5/3 cupcakes left after the first part of the question.\n4] The second step is similarly to divide 3 + 5/3 = 10/3 by 6/6, but both the numerator and the denominator share a common denominator of six, which is the total number of cupcakes(60). Hence, Anna has 10/6 cupcakes left.\n5] The process of dividing 10/3 + 10/6 = 20/6+10/6 by 6/6 results in 16/56. Both 56 and 56 share the denominator of six as 60. Hence, Anna is left with 16/6 cupcakes. \n6] At last, the fraction can be simplified to 16/6 = 8. A table can be created to represent the same. Thus Anna has eaten 8 cupcakes at the end of the process.\n\n### A: There is still some work to be done; a missing piece is that the answer is the number of cupcakes Anna has. So:\n\n7.

Choices:  a) 1250 b) 1896 c) 1996 d) 2009 e) 1976\nOutput:The Olympics started in 776 BC according to legend.\nThe first recorded Olympics were the Games of 776 BC in Ancient Olympia. This took place 28 years after the legendary founder of the Games, Hercules, was said to have brought the ancient Greek athletic competition to Olympia. The Greek philosopher, Phocion, told the Greek city-states that the games had originally been created from an offering given to the Greek sun god, Helios. He suggested that the original festival be revived when warlord Pheidon united all the cities in ancient Greece. Pheidon, along with his cousin, Pisander, organized the first modern games of 776, which was the first time the Olympic flame was used as a symbol of a celebration, the 1st marathon ran was 43 years later in 724 BC and were won by a man called Kleomenes. However, the ancient games were interrupted many times with periods of about six centuries separated by time by wars of varying intensity.\n \nThe Olympics has continued to grow with 97 countries participating in Summer Games and 78 countries participating in the Winter Games. The winter games are far less popular than the summer games with more spectators and more athletes. Although there are many countries that participate in both the Winter and Summer Games, only two countries have hosted both games: Italy (in 1", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "1st approach: 1. First, we can use a list of rules to understand the problem. The problem states that Timothy has $50. \n2. We can assume that $50 is the total number of available dollars we can use to buy items. \n3. In this problem, there are three items that we can buy using these $50: \n- T-shirts- Price: $8 \n- Bags- Price: $10\n- Key chains- Price: $2, so 3 pieces cost $4 each\n4. Timothy only buys two t-shirts but needs to buy three key chains. However, according to the information given, he only has $50 to use. How can he buy a key chain when he doesn\u2019t have enough to buy the second t-shirt?\n5. To understand the problem better, I\u2019ll simplify the information given and use the number of available dollars to keep track of how much Timothy has used. I\u2019ll call $50 \u201cX\u201d. X, I have $0 (since X is equal to $50), and I must buy 2 items. I\u2019ll call the price of the shirts and bags and use different colors to highlight the remaining amount of dollars X and the price of items.\n6. If he buys $4 worth of key chains, he only has $6 left. He can\u2019t buy the 4th key chain because money isn\u2019t the factor he has to worry about.\n7.

What is important in this case is finding enough information to solve what can be considered as one of the \u201csub-problems\u201d. \n10. A simpler problem can include only three items, without specifying which ones and the total amount needed.\n11.

The number has to be larger than 16 to leave us with any of the 16 to give away.\n4) The number left at this point is X/2 + 8.  After we give some more light bulbs away, the number left is (X/2 + 8)/6.  And so on.\n5) This would give us one of the possible values (X/2, X/4, X/8 and so on...) where X is the total number of bulbs.\n6) This leads to the first solution Y = 25- X \n7) We can further simplify this and get Y = X -1, which is our final answer.\n\n6) We can further simplify  and get Y = X-1. We can finally conclude the answer is D: Y=X-1 \nSo the final answer here will be D: Y= X-1 \n\n\nInput: John\u2019s birthday party was a blast. There seemed to be too many cookies.

{"text": "1.\"The total cost of buying four lawnmowers two years ago was 2/5 of the total cost today\". 2. This problem can be modeled as the following question: \"How much more does Mr. Lucian need to pay today to buy the same lawnmowers as two years ago?\". 3. We can express the same problem as a function, which is equal to the first year price divided by the second year price times four. It should be noted that the result has to be a rational number and the function should be a 1/1 ratio, which implies that if the second year price is equal to 100, then the ratio of the price of 1/4 of the lawnmowers is equal to 1/5, thus the function returns a 1/5 number. 4. The function can be used to find the price of Mr. Lucian's lawnmowers after two years.\n5. Since the function returns a 5/1 ratio and 1/5 of the original price for a lawnmower equals 32, then we need to add three and a twelfth to the price and multiply by four to get 430. 6. Hence, the final answer is D. Since 3/5 is equal to 60, and two years ago the cost of buying one lawnmower was equal to 600, then buying four lawn mowers would cost 430.\nSo the final answered is D.\n\nInput: What is the area of a circle?

Since any missing body part is a loss in itself, simply stating that a person lost nothing is reasonable.\nSecond, the loss of a part of a specific body part is also not considered. For example, if the man lost his right hand or finger, this would not be considered loss of any body part.

{"text": "11. To begin with, let us understand the data and format of the given question.\n2. First of all, we can understand that carrots, zucchini, and broccoli are the three primary vegetables here.\n3. Now, if the merchant sold half of the vegetables that he had installed, then he would be left with half of this mass of vegetables (half the sum of his original stock). \n4. This would make all the vegetables he had stocked worth 1/2 the total sum of his original stock.\n5. Let us call this mass of vegetables 'M'. Hence, M = M1/2, where M1/2 is the original sum of all the vegetables he installed, which is the total mass of carrots, zuchinni, and broccoli.\n6. Substituting the values in place of the constant, we get 11.5 kg of vegetables did the merchant sell.\nSo the final answers is D: 11.5kg\n\nInput: A clog of boats travel along the river.

{"text": "1: It's important to understand the different types of croissants sold by Harrison.\n2. A regular croissant costs $3.50 per day and an almond croissants costs $5.50 per day on Sunday's.\n3. We want to know how much does he spends on croissants in one year in total.\n4. Since he would buy a regular croissant on all the other days of the week too, and it costs $3.5 per day, the total expenses of Harrison on regular croissants in a whole year is $78.\n5. Moreover, on Sundays, he buys an almond croissanta, which is double the price of his regular croissant.\n6. This would mean that he would have bought an almond croissant on Sunday's 22 times for the year, which equals 110 x $5.5 = $624.\n7. This would make his total yearly expenses for croissants equal to $624 + 78 = $702.\n8. To answer this question, we need to calculate how much Harrison spent on croissants in the past year.\n9.

{"text": "125 packs and answer to the question\n2. It is crucial to break down the problem into smaller, comprehensible steps, and the most logical approach is to begin with the given information.\n3. Using the given information, we determine that Hayes does three loads of laundry per week, and each load uses a detergent pod.\n4. If we assume that he uses a pack of detergent pod per load, then he needs to do 3 loads per week times 52 weeks.\n5. Therefore, Hayes will need to consume 3 packs per week times 51 weeks, which is 155 packs per year.\n6. Since we have already assumed that a detergent pods pack comes in 39 pods, it is logical to conclude that Hayes will need 39 packs per 52 weeks, which makes 125 pack of detergent per year.\n7. We conclude that Hayes will require 125 pack in order to fully cover his yearly laundry process\nSo the final answer if 125\n\nInput: The average speed of a boat is 35 miles per hour how many hours would be needed to travel 1000 miles?\nOutput: 28.57 hours\n2. Read the question\n3. The first step is to identify what information we're given and what we are asked to find. In this case, we are asked to find the answer to the given question: \"How long would it take the boat to travel 10 miles?\"\n4. It is essential to determine if the \"average speed\" implies \"constant speed\", or if we can assume any reasonable range of speeds for the boat.\n5. Constant speed is often used in measuring distance and time in transportation, so it is reasonable to assume that the boat maintains a constant speed throughout the entire journey.\n6. To determine the answer, the most crucial step is to determine the distance covered and the time taken.\n7. We begin with the given information that the average speed is 35 miles/hour.\n8. Using the formula for speed, 1 mile/hour = 1.61 kilometers/hour.\n9. Substituting the given information into the formula, we obtain 22 kilometers/hour. Therefore,", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "1. The question is about estimating the amount of time it takes to recover 2 animals from the zoo.\n2. It is asking for the total amount of time, but the question is phrased in a way that makes it seem like the amount of time is determined by each of the animals.\n3. It is logical to assume that the zoo would spend 2 hours to recover one animal, and then spend another 2 hours to recover the second animal.\n4. Alternatively, the zoo could spend 1 hour to recover both animals at once, but the question doesn't specify that this is an option. \n5. However, the question does not provide any context for the zoo's recovery process, so it cannot be ruled out that the zoo would take longer to recover multiple animals at once. \n6. Additionally, the question doesn't indicate how many animals are being recovered at once, so the time taken to recover the 2 rhinos and the 3 lions could all potentially happen in 2 hours.\n7. Therefore it's important to realize that the question is ambiguous and the time taken to recover animals from a zoo could vary based on various factors such as the specific animals being recovered and the zoo's recovery procedure.\nIn conclusion, the question is asking for the amount of time it would take to recover 2 animals, but the actual time taken could vary due to various factors and is not specified. \nSo the final answer based on your analysis would be A: does not have enough information to determine time\n\nInput: The zoo asked for donations, how much do you think that they made?

In one of his earliest, and most famous, works, Composition V (1913), he sought to remove a specific, real, subject from the picture. He believed this would lead the observer to focus on the underlying color and rhythmic qualities of a work, giving it more meaning. One could speculate that a man painting a boat in the background is Kandinsky himself. Another interpretation is a figure from Minoan art who has morphed into a modern person. The color shifts across the canvas indicate a change in direction of a river or a road.\nOutput: 1 Kandinsky believed that by removing the real subject from the picture, the observer would focus on the underlying color, rhythm, and composition.\n2 The image depicts a boat in the background and a figure from Minoa art that was morphed into a modern-day person.\n3 The color shifts across a landscape depict a change in direction of the river or road.

{"text": "Answer:\n1. First, let's write the problem like this for clarity's sake: \"Jacob has half thenumber of shoes Edward does\"\n2. And, \"Edward has 3 times the numbers of shoes Brian does\"\n3. Then, we can plug in the numbers from the table to get a mathematical equation: \"Jacob (10)has half (5)the number of shoes (20)Edward (20)has\"\n4. Similarly, we'll write, \"Brian (10)has (20)22(2)times the number of shoes (6)Edward (2)has\"\n5. From this expression, you can see that Brian has 6 more shoes than Edward does; 22-6 = 16 shoes.\n6. When you add the two equations together, Edward has (16+20)16 pairs of shoes, and Jacob has (5+10)5 pairs of shoes.\n7. To find out how many pairs of shoers they have altogether, you can subtract this equation: (5+10)-(16+20)=-16\n8.

{"text": "1: The question is asking how long does Jeff spend working in a week given his weekend and weekday habits. 2: The first step is to analyze and understand the pattern of the given information. 3: In the weekend, Jeff spends two hours. 4: The first day of the week has four working hours and that is double than the weekend, therefore Monday is four times the weekend. The same logic can be applied to the weekday where Wednesday is double of Tuesday, which is again double of Monday, which is four times the weekends. 5: Now, the working hours can be easily calculated because there were two working days this week, which is double of the weekends. The total working hours of the week is 8. 6: Let's say Jeff spends three hours on weekend to catch up, and he spends a total of 3*4 = 12 hours weekend. He has 12 hours from weekends, so each day of week he spends one hour on Monday and two hours on Tuesday. 7: The same calculation can be continued for other days. The total time spent on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday is 3, 2 and 1 hour respectively. When all the days' times add up, it adds up to 12 hours. 8: Now let's solve for the weekly working hours. If we know each day of week has 3, 2, 1, 4 and 4 hours of working days, if Jeff adds another 3 hours which was mentioned in the question, then the total working hours is 4*5 +3 + 12 = 1 + 2 + 12 =15 hours. 9: Therefore, the working hours of Jeff is 15 hours a week.\nSo the final answe is D: 15 hours. \n\nInput: 1.878279 * 1.27 278397 Is one of the answers? 3112.57\nOutput: 1) Yes, the answer is yes. 27831.582 is one of the possible answers. \n2.8783298 is 89 digits long.

{"text": "1) This question poses as a typical arithmetic question with a numerical format (3.00, 6.00, 4.00, and so on), but it also includes information about how to prepare and price the granola. However, the correct answer does not require any additional information from context.\n2) For the question in its original numerical format, the initial cost can be expressed in terms of the amount of goods available and the amount of profit received. The total cost is (3.00 x 20) = 60.00 and the total profit is 60.0 - 6.0 = 54.00. So the amount of goods initially available is 3.00 / 54.0 = 0.056.\n3) Based on the quantity of granola initially available, the cost per bag can be expressed as ((60.0 - ((3.00 / (0.056 x 55))) = 6.30 (rounded to 6 dollars).\n4) The initial retail price is (60.0 - (3.00 / ((75 x 20) x 0.055 x 55)) = 6 dollars per bag.\n5) This means that the price per bag after the initial selling rate is (6 x 15)/(15 + 5) = 4.17 (rounded to 4 dollars).\n6) The final net profit can be calculated as (6 x 5) - (4.17 x 15) = 60 - 67.8 = -7.8 dollars.", "answer": " 50"}

Therefore, we know the width and also length of the shape.\n3) Also the width we are trying to calculate here would be equal to twice the length of the flower bed subtracting 1.\n4) So we need to divide twice the length by 2 adding 1 to it. This gives us the width of the garden.\n5) To find the length we again divide length by 2 subtracting 1 from it. This would give us the length of the fence needed after deducting 2 meters of fence from the length of the garden.\n6) Now we have all the dimensions, we just need to multiply them by the length of fence needed. This gives us 68.\nSo the answer is 68 meters.\nSo the final answers are:\n1. A: length = 6\n2. B: width = 8\n3. C: length needed = 68\n\nInput: What is an apple a day for?

{"text": "1)To answer this question, you need to calculate the odds for losing and winning each of the two lawsuits, respectively. The odds of winning the first lawsuit are 30% x 5000000 = 150000 (Win) and 0 = (Lose)\n2) and the odds of winning the second lawsuit are: 50% x 100000 (Lose) and 50% x $2,00,00,0 (Win)\n3) Subtract these answers and it indicates that the probability of winning both lawsuits is $2,007,000 (Win).\n4) However, it's worth noting that the odds of losing both lawsuits is calculated as (not winning each lawsuit) - $2,006,000 (not win) = $1,00,060,00 - $2,010,000 (lose)\n5) Which means that the odds of Andy losing both lawsuits are $2,005,600 x 1 = $2,004,000 (Loss)\n6) Therefore, the odds of a win for Andy in both cases are $2,090,000 x 1= $1,006,219.19\n7) Subtracting the first value from the second gives a total of $30062.19, meaning that the odds of winning are $2,300,008.69 x 0.30 (lose)  x $5,00,0,00 (Win)  = $10,00,598.09 or $3,005,598.40.\n8) This means that the odds that Andy loses both of his cases is three times more likely than winning both lawsuits.\nSo the final  answer is: B: 30062\n\nInput: What is the ratio of numbers 19, 20, 24 and 28?

To solve this problem, it is important to first calculate the total cost of materials that went into making one bracelet. The strings come for $1 a piece, and there are three beads for each bracket, so that would be $3 per bracelet.\n\n3.) We can then determine the total profit that can be made by using a simple calculation. The selling price of each bracelet is $6, but we also need to subtract the total cost of materials needed. The materials cost for one bracelet is $4 ($3 for beads and $1 for string).\n\n4.) Multiply the selling price by the number of bracelets and the profit together, and then subtract the cost of materials. The result will show your total profit from selling a bracelet.

It's important to note that \"plant the flowers\" is not exactly the same as \"buy a flower\". The two concepts are related, but there are important differences. \n2. First of all, consider that \"plant the flowers\u201d does not have a specific value. It is a concept that refers to the action of putting the flowers in the ground. \n3. Similarly, \"buy the flower\" has a specific amount and it's different from planting it in some ways.\n4. To determine the cost of buying the flowers, one must then consider: the number of flowers and the price of the pot.\n5.

When it comes to using \"plant the flower\" instead of \"buy the flower\", all the steps remain the same. \n7.

{"text": "1) By reading the question, we can infer that the number of apples left in the basket at the end of the day depends on the total number of apples at the beginning of the day.\n2) Let's look at the first sentence and see what the original number of apples is. The beginning of the sentence says that there were '74 apples in the basket'.\n3) From the sentence we know that there are two people, Ricki and Samson, and that Ricki removes 1/6th fewer apples than Samson.\n\n4) We can now plug in some numbers into the equation. The initial number of apples was '74'. We know that Ricki picked 1/6th as many apples as Samson. This means that Samson picked '74 + 14' apples, while Ricki picked '74 - 14' appels.\n5) Now that we know that the value of Ricki's pick is 60 apples, we can plug it into the equation: 'basket apples -ricki picks +samsom pick = total baskat apples', which gives us 'basket apples = 60 + samsom picks'.\n\n6) The next step is to solve the equation: 'baskat apples = 66'. \n\n7) To further evaluate the equation, let's plug in some values.

The question asks the number of bolts and nuts used for the project, indicating that the remaining items after the project is completed should not be included in the calculation.\n3. The project required 7 boxes of bolths and 3 boxes of nits.\n4. The number of remaining nuts (6) is greater than the remaining bolts (3) implying that he used only the entire quantity of bolts (11 x 7 = 77) and only part of the nuts (15 x 3 = 45).\n5. Since each box of bolts contains 11 bolts and has a different number of nuts, it is not known how much of each kind of nut was used.\n6. An approximation can be made by reducing the quantities of nuts and bolts based on their respective ratios. By substituting 11 for 3.333333, it can be noted that 15 nuts are used for every 3.33 nuts.\n7. When this value is applied to the remaining nuts, it yields the approximation of 75 nuts.\n8.

The first thing to do when working out a mathematical problem like this one is to look for any clues provided in the question before doing any actual calculation.\n2. After carefully reading the problem, the first thing to note is that Margaux collects $5, $8, and $4 daily.\n3. This means that Margaux collects a sum of $21 on any individual day. \n4. Based on this understanding, the total amount Margaux collects after seven days should not be more than $21 multiplied by seven.\n5. In other words, the total amount collected by Margaux should not exceed 157. Based on this calculation, the answer is $157.\n6. To validate the answer, it's also necessary to consider how much each individual person gives on an individual day.\n7. Assuming Margaux collects $4 daily from her cousin and $8 daily from her brother, this means they give her a sum of $16 and $24 respectively on any individual day.\n8. At the end of the week, the total amount Margoux collects from her cousin is $16 multiplied by 7, which is $112.\n9. The total amount she collects from her brother is $24 multiplied by 7 which is $168.\n10. To ensure consistency of interpretation, it should be noted that the seven in the question suggests a week in a single instance, rather than a series of weeks.\n11. Margaux collects $21 on any day and has collected a total of $157 after seven days.\n12. Therefore the final answer is $15,700.\nSo the final ans is $15,070\n\nInput: How many cats does the teacher have? Choices:  H: 12 C: 2 I: 15 J: 0 S: 6\nOutput: The answer is \u201cC\u201d: 2\n1.

The key to understanding this question is to focus on the details of the scenario and to avoid common errors that can lead to incorrect answers.\n\n3:. The first error to avoid is to assume that alligators traveled the same route as Paul, although this might seem obvious.\n\n4:. However, it is important to consider the travel time for Paul as well as the additional time it took for the other alligators to travel with him.\n\n5:. If the other alligators took the same route as Paul initially, then their travel time will be twice as long to cover both directions compared to Paul's original round trip.\n\n6:. Therefore, the travel time for the other five alligators would have been twice as long as the travel time for Paul.\n\n7:.

This equation means that $x = y + c$, where $ c $, or $ c $, is any constant.\n2. Using the rules of algebra, you can rewrite the expression as $ (y - x) + c = x $, which means that there are different types of $ 4-sided shapes that are pentagon. \n3. However, it is important to remember that the constants $ y $ and $ x $ are both of a different type from $ c $.\n4. As a result, we must find a way to reduce the values of $ y $ and $ c $ by one or more variables, using the values of $ x $ and $ z $.\n5. To do this, we can use the values $ x $ and $ y $ in the algebra equation to reduce $ c $.\n6. So we can work out: $ c = x + y \\implies x = y + c $\n7. Now we put these values of x, y and c in the equation: $ x = y + c $, which means that the answer is a total of $ x $ = $ y $ + $ c $.\n8. Therefore, the final answer is C:$ x = y + c $.", "answer": " 14"}

That will result in 12 feet (1 tree) per one day (cut down one foot per second).\n5) If one elm tree is cut down in one day at the rate of one-foot per second, how many pieces of wood could be cut from it?\nAnswer: Since 8 feet is one tree and we want to cut 12 feet, so we have to cut down two trees on the first day, then next day we cut down another tree and the day after day.\nSo we can say, by cutting down an elm tree at the rate of 8 feet per second, an average of 32 trees can be cut down in a day. \nSo the final answer will be option B: Option B: 32 pieces of wood could be made from one elm tree in one week; 496 in one month; 9,832 in one year; and 247,672 in 60 years\nSo the final answer in this instruction is Option B: 33 pieces of wood could be from the elm tree", "answer": " 2"}

This implies Linda didn't initially start with any money and just received the $5.\n3: The second clue provides insight into the amount of money Lucy originally had. It states, \"Lucy had originally had $20\".\n4: From these two clues, we can conclude that Linda started with no money and Lucy initially had $20.\n5: The question then goes on to ask how much Lucy had at the end of the transaction.\n6: Since $5 was given by Lucy to Linda, Lucy would have the exact same amount of money as her at the end of the process.\n7: Therefore, after Lucy gives $5 to Linda, Lucy has $15 left.\n8: Hence, by using the clues and mathematical logic, the answer to the question is $15.\nSo the final output is $15 \nSo the final answer for input is $15", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "1) First we need to know that each unicorn walks forward with each step. We cannot say the same for each plant that comes up. So the question basically gives us 6 unicorns and 4 flowers. 2) We need to know how many flowers sprout to arrive at the right answer. 3) We can conclude that the flowers will sprout as each unicorn steps forward. It is also mentioned that the unicorns don't walk in parallel, which implies that they might walk in a different sequence. 4) We can notice that every 9 km, each unicorn will be in a different position, and we don't know if plants will sprout or not if one unicorn will not be behind another. 5) So, the right question is \"Will every unicorn be within 1 km of each other?\" 6) Since the question states that there are six unicorn in the enchanted forest and each unicorn can walk forward by 3 m, and will travel 2 km every 3 steps, the total flowers in an area of 20 km would be 8. 7) ANSWER: 8 Flowers because every unicorn would be in a different part of the forest.\nSo the final and correct answer is 8.\n\nInput: How do we write $1,400?

Therefore, we can deduce that there are seven gnomes in the fifth house.\n4. This information, combined with the fact that there are a total of twenty gnomes on the entire street, allows us to conclude that there are thirteen gnomes in the fourth house and four gnomes in the third house.\n5. Finally, by subtracting the thirteen gnom es in the fourth house from the twenty gnomes on this street, we know that there are seven g nomes in the fifth house which is the correct answer.\nSo the final answers are: 20, 3, 3, 7, 13, 4", "answer": " 8"}

We note that Lilah's grandparently took 400 photographs of the family during their 2-day stay at the Grand Canyon. They took half as many photos on the first day as they took on the 2nd day.\nLilha then took 120 more photoons on the 2nd than on the 1st day of the trip. By adding all the 400 photograph to the family gallery, Lilah can obtain the total number of photographs in the gallery.\n\n3: To determine the total number of photograph in the gallery. We first have to calculate the total number of photograph taken on the first day and second day, then determine how many times the total number of photograph are in the family's photograph gallery\nSo, the grandparents took 200 pictures on the 1st. So, we could get the total number of photograph on the 1st as 200+120. Thus, we can get a total of 320 pictures on the first day.\nSimilarly, we can get 120+200 photos on the second day. So, the total number of pictures on the second day would be 320+120=440 photos.\nTo find the total number of photograph, we need to multiply the total number of photos taken by the number of times total photograph taken. Thus, the total number of photograph. Thus, 400+320+130\u00d72=440+180+260\u00d72=1640+520\nSo, the answer would be 1650.", "answer": " 920"}

{"text": "1) Firstly, we note that some values in the problem are missing and may be obtained mathematically from the given values. For example, the recovery rate for the second day, given that there were 500 new cases on that day, is 10% or 0.1. \n2) It is given that the total number of positive Coronavirus cases reached 2000 on the third day when there were 1500 new positive cases. Thus, the number of cumulative positive cases after the third = 2000 + 1500 = 3500 \n3) After adding 500 to 2000, we get 2500, which gives us 2500 + 10% of 500 = 2650 + 50 = 2700. \n4) After adding 200 to 150, we get 3500 + 300 = 3800 \n5) Then by subtracting 3800 from 3500, we get the answer to the question = 350.\n6) Thus, the total number of positive COronavirus cases after the third day is 350. \nSo the final answer(s) is C:350", "answer": " 3750"}

{"text": "1 The question asks to calculate how much money Missy had put in the bank, in dollars, in the first year.\n2. The formula for a geometric sequence is a_n = ar^(1/n), where ar is the common ratio and n is the number of years. \n3. From the given information, we know that the third year's amount multiplied by two is $800, the fourth year's amount multiplies by two is $1200, and the second-year increase in her contributions is $200.\n4. To calculate the amount she contributed to the first year, we can start with the assumption that the first year's contribution is double the second-year contribution.\n5. In other words, Missy contributed $200 the second year. She contributed $400 the third year, and $600 the fourth year.\n6. Therefore the first year's amount is $120(double the $60), and we can use the formula: a_n = ar^1/n\n7. The geometric series formula states that, for a geometric sequence, the common ratio r is a percentage. For this example, r is 450/1450 = 0.3, and the sequence continues to multiply beyond the tenth year, which would represent the current amount. \n8. Therefore, by using the formula and the given information, we can calculate the amount Missy contributed to the first year: 120(ar^(1/10)) = 36.5\n9.

The first thing I notice are the numbers with a \"/*.\" before them, followed by an operator (//) and another number.\n2. This format indicates that the first number on the left of the operator is being multiplied by the second number on the right of the operator and then both answers are being added together.\n3. In this case, the answer being added together is -1.\n4. Another way to write this expression as \"7711 / 10491 = -1879\".\n5. We now know that the 1st number, 7711, is being divided by the 2nd number, and the two answers of the division are being added together to get -1879.\n6. If you multiply this entire equation by -1, then you are subtracting the results of 771 from 771 and doing the same for 10492.\n7. If you remove the first \"7711/\", it becomes -1879*-1871 = -37571.\n8. Subtract the answer of 7713 from 37571, we get 0.

We need to find out, how many pages did Sabrina have to read to finish the series?\n5. To answer this question we need to first decide the number of volumes. This will depend on the number of pages.\n6. Thus, the number of volumes = ( 200 x ( number of books ) ) / ( number of pages available ) = 200 x 14 / 2 = 14000 pages / 2 = 7\n7. The total number of pages will be 14 x 7 = 14 x 200 = 2800 pages.\n8. Now the total number of pages = 140 pages + 2800 = 3100 pages.\n9. So the total number of pages is 14 x 140 + 28 x 1400 = 140 x 2150 + 280 x 140 = 21400 + 37280 = 58680 pages.\nSo the final  answer is 58689 pages.\n\nInput:If the answer is 31, can you find the sum?

To solve this problem, we need to first find the total number of vibrations experienced in 5 minutes, which can be calculated as (1600 vps x 5 minutes) where vps is the number of vibrations per second (VPS). \n3.) Now we can calculate the rate of change by dividing 600 vps (highest setting) by 1600 (lowest setting) to get the value of x (change of rate) which is equal to 0.375. \n4.) Next, we need to find x squared (second power of x) which is equal to equal to (0.375 x 0.37) or equal to 0.14375. 5.) Once we have obtained x squared, we can use it to solve for the total number of vibration per minute. \n6.) To do this, we multiply the value of x squared by 5 minutes, which gives us the resulting total number of vibrating per minute, 0.146375.

First of all the question we have to understand what is meaning and the relationship between the numbers 2,30 and 900. If look at the number 30 so the relationship is 2:30= 2 gram of charcoal for 30 ml water. So 2 =30 means we need to multiply or divide a number so for that we make an equation. So the equation will be  2:30 = 30:30 means we need 6:30 or so, it is also called \"parts to whole\" in math. \n3.After that we have another question that is if jason add 900 mls of water so it means he need 900:30 or 30mils of charcoal added for 900 m. Now we can make another equation by multiplying two given numbers. That is 900:1 = 30:900. Now we substitute a number into that equation like 900 to a, now a=900 so, 900=30:90 the rest canceled.  900/90 = 10 so charcoal added is 900 m to a=900 m to get a so, we divide 900 by 90 so it comes out to be 10. \n4.So the final answer to the question is, 900 m =20 mls of charcoal and to sum up this math question and its answer it would be that, 2 grams of black paint have to be mixed to every 30 mls of water. 900 m of water requires 20 mls of black paint mixed to it.\nSo the final equation will be  2 : 30 = 900 : 10 that is 900 = 90 or 9:1, so charcoal = 900 m= 20 m= 9:1", "answer": " 60"}

The rope has to be purchased so it makes a nice even rope, so that is 6 pieces of rope.\n3. 25% off is calculated by dividing by 2 and multiplying by 5 when you purchase two 10 foot ropes.\n4. So how many times 1 does 5 is 5.625\n5. How many times 5.62 does 20 is 131.\n6. $130.62 is the price of the rope. So how much longer is it than the rope? 6 inches which are 0.625 feet.\n7. So the total cost is $130.00 + (0.625) * 100% = $130.75\nSo the final answer should be that we buy six ropes and a cost $130.50. We have a price of $130.25 for four, 10 foot, pieces of rope, which are a total of 40 feet, and we pay another 0.50 cents for the 6 extra feet, leaving us with 40.50 feet.\nSo the final cost is $40,00 - $6250 (after lashing together).

{"text": "1: The problem can be rearranged to read: \"After losing 60% of his marbles outside and 50% down a sewer, Archie has only 20 marbles left, so how many did he start off with?\".\n2. The first step is to understand the problem and its steps.\n3. Archie started with 100 marbles and lost 60% (60) of them through the street, so he is left with 40 marbles.\n4. As the street is the only place where he lost marbles, he has already left only 40 marbles outside.\n5. Archie lost half of his marbles when 50% of them went down a sewer. \n\nTherefore, Archie is left with 0.5 * 0.5 = 25% of his marbles or 10 marbles.\n6. This left him with 40 - 10 = 30 marbles at the start. The final answer is 30.\nSo the final solution is 30 is the answer to this question\n\nInput:The king of Spain lived in the kingdom of Spain.

We can first see that Naomi will be doing different types of laundry, including cleaning sheets, towels, and clothes that need to be cleaned.  \n3. We can then learn that Naomi will be separating the laundry based on the type of laundry and how she wants to wash it. \n4. For example, she will be sorting the clothes that need to be on the gentle cycle into one pile, while the towels will take twice as long to wash and will be sorted into another pile. The sheets will be washed in less time than the towels and will be sorted into the third pile.\n5. We can use this information to deduce that the total amount of time it takes for Naomi to washing the laundry will need to use different times to wash each type of laundry. \n6. Based on the given information, we can start to make some guesses as to the time it will take for Naomi to do each kind of laundry.\n7. First, we should account for the difference in time between washing the towels (twice as long) and the clothes on the gentle cycle.\n8. The information given to us (that the towels take twice the amount of time to wash) shows that it takes one hour for one pile for washing and 2 hours for a different pile.\n9.

During the hiking trip, she consumes two pounds of water and one-third the weight of food per pound of water every hour.\n\n2. The question can be broken down into two parts: the initial weight of Karen's pack, and the weight she will be carrying after six hours. The first part is simple enough: the total weight of her initial pack is 65 lbs.\n\n3. The second part is more complex: during the six-hour hiking trip, Karen will consume 2 lbs of water and 1/3rd of the weight of food per lb of water every hour. This means that she will consume 25 lbs of food and 25 lbs for water during the trip, making the total weight she will be carrying 90 lbs after six hours.\n\n4. The question asks how much weight Karen is carrying after six hours, so to answer this properly, you will need to use the formula W1 + (W1 \u00d7 t) + (W2 \u00d7 t2) = W3, where W1 is the initial weight of her back pack, W2 is the weight she will consume during the hike, and W3 is the weight she will carry after the hike.\n\n5. Solving this equation and simplifying, we get\n\nW3 = W1 + (W2*t) = 65 lbs + (25 lbs*(1hour/6 hours)) = 85 lbs\n\nTherefore, Karen is carrying 85 lbs of weight after six hours.\nSo the final answers is C: 85 lbs", "answer": " 34"}

After identifying these parameters, the question is asking how many hay bales would be left by the end of a month if a farmer starts feeding his horses at a certain date and considers the additional acres of grass the farmer planted this year.\n3. The key information from the question can be reframed as: \"The farmer has x bales of harvested hay and his horses consume y bales of hay per day. How many hay bales will be left after feeding the horses for one month?\"\n2. With the question reframed, we can start solving it by first identifying the relevant information: the farmer has x bale of harvested hay, each horse consumes y bales per day, and the farmer starts feeding the horses from September 1.\n3. To find the total number of bales left at the end of the month, we need to find the total number of y-bales of hay consumed by the horses over the course of one month.\n4. We can calculate this amount using the formula:\n5. Now that we have the total number of hay bales consumed over the course of one moth, we can divide it by x to get the total number of hay Bales left at the end. This gives us the answer: 190\n6.

The maximum weight specified in the question (600 lb) is equivalent to 6 children whose average weight is (64*6) =324.\n4. Considering this and knowing that two children just enter elevator (children avg weight =32.5 lb) remaining weight is 324 - 2 x 32.5 = 298.\n5. One adult with avg weight 140 lb is also sufficient to load elevator. 298 + 46.7 = 344.7 lbs, <600 lbs => max weight = max (344.7, 2 x 140) = 344, max weight = 344 lbs.\n6.

This can be found by multiplying the total number of eraser (1152) by 0.75 to determine that the total sale amount would be 871 dollars. To determine the total of erasers that were sold, we must subtract the total cost of 9000 from the total sale amount of 871 which indicates that 831 erasers were sold in the sale. \nFrom this, we can determine total profit earned by subtracting the total cost of 8087.50 from the total sale of 871 to find a profit of 683.50.\n\nSo the answers are 831 and 683.\n\nInput: After graduating, a young boy decided to take summer courses in college before enlisting in the army.

This makes the number of birthday presents purchased in December come to a total of 3 (2 brothers born in December + 1 for Santana). \n5. Now, to find the number of presents to be purchased in the second half of a year, we must subtract 3 (the number of birthday presents bought in December) from 7 (the total number of birthday presents to be bought). \n6.

{"text": "1.) It is important to understand the problem statement before proceeding with the solution.\n2.) The question asks for change obtained when a $50 bill is used to purchase 3 pens, 4 notebook, and 2 folders.\n3.) The question mentions that the pens are bought for $1 each, the notebooks are bought for $3 each, and the folders are bought for $5 each.\n4.) In terms of cost, the total cost of all the items is $17 (3 * $1 + 4 * $3 + 2 * $5).\n5.) Based on the information provided, we know that the total cost was $17, but we also must know how much the purchases were separated.\n6.) Knowing the total cost gives us an idea of the cost of each item, but in order to get the change, we need to know how many of each item are purchased.\n7.) Therefore, we can restate the problem as: How much change do you get when you spend $17 and buy:\n6 pens, 28 notebooks, 5 folders, and a $50 bill\n9.) The answer would not be the exact change because the problem does not specify what the payment in cash was made with, but it does require the answer to provide an approximation.\n10.) Therefore, the best way to approach this problem is to break down the total cost into the components for each category, and then add it to the amount from the $50 bill to be given change.\n11.) In this case, the total cost is $17, so we know that we need to get change for the difference between $17 and the amount from the $40 bill. \n12.) After breaking down the components and calculating it is easy to find the difference, since we just need to add the total amount given by the $50 bill.\n13.) The total amount given by the 50 bill is $55 (50*5/10).\n14.) Finally, we can get change by adding the first part of the total ($17), the remainder from the second ($55) to get a total of $72. So, the change from a 50 bill is 12 dollars more than the total purchase.\nInput: Is it better to go to the gym at home or at", "answer": " 25"}

Choices:1. add2. subtract3. multiply4. divide\nOutput: 1: 1+1=-1 2: 1+0=1 3: 1+2=3 4: 0+1=1\n5. The question asks which mathematical operation \"toward\" represents in a given example.\n6. To answer this question, we need to analyze the operation \"toward\". \n7. An operation is defined as the transformation of a set of inputs to produce a set of outputs through a set of rules or logic. We can do this operation in various ways, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, etc., depending on the context. \n8. In this case, we need to consider the type of word \"toward\", which is a preposition, rather than \"toward\" as a mathematical operation. \n9. Prepositions are used to indicate the direction in which something is moving or the place where something is being directed. For example, \"toward\" can be used to describe the direction of something that is moving or advancing, such as a ship moving \"toward\" a port or an animal that is \"running toward\" its home. \n10. Another example is \"away from\". If someone is \"running away from\" something, it indicates that they are moving in the opposite direction, away from that thing. \n11. The \"toward\" word is also used to express the end goal or final destination. For example, \"move toward\" is used to describe the action of a person or animal moving or advancing \"toward\" something. \n12. Another example is \"turn toward\", which is used to describe the motion of someone's head or body \"toward\" the direction of something. \n13. Moreover,", "answer": " 265"}

Firstly, consider the options. None of these options appear to be related to what the question is asking for.\n3. To begin to solve the problem, multiply the number of quarters in Karen's bank by 0.25 to get the total number of dollars in her bank.\n4. The same can be done for Christopher's bank.\n5. Next, subtract the amount of quarters in Christopher's bank from Karen's. This will give the dollar amount in Christopher's piggie bank.\n6. Finally, subtract the dollar amount in Karen's piggie from Christopher's. This will be Christopher's value.\n7. Given the inputs, we can write the following equation to solve for the value:\n(Karen's piggy +1/4) - (Christopher's piggy x 1/4) = (total value of both piggies) x 1/4 \nKaren's piggies = 1/4 of Christopher's, so to solve for value, you subtract that from both sides to get: \n(Karen' value + Christopher's total value) = value \n(1/4Karen's value + 1/4Christopher's value) \n8.

{"text": "The question is asking how many floors the Chrysler Building has. When the number of floors in the Leeward Center is known, we can use this information to determine how many more floors the Chryslera Building has.\n1. We can start by using the relationship between them and write an equation.\n2. Let f represent the total number of floors at the Chrysler Building\n3. We are given that the total number of flooring in the Leeward Century is L\n4. We can rewrite our equation by applying knowledge to replace f\n5. We know that L + 11 = f and using simple math we can solve for the equation\n6. We have f = L + 11\n7. We subtract the equation from both sides to isolate the unknown variable (f) and to reduce to lowest terms\n8. To be precise let f = 10, 20, 30, 50, 80, 120\n9. We can simplify the equation and obtain 11f = 10 + 11 *21\n10. To solve for f we know that 11L + 121 = f\n11. Since the value of f that satisfies this equation is 120, we can conclude that the Chrysler Building must have 120 floors\nSo the final answer from this is 120\n\nInput: If you combine two cats and a dog they become three kittens.

Option B is not correct as Lloyd would have no cards if an extra 60 were acquired, and option C would result in more cards for Michael (140 extra cards) than Lloyd (40 extra cards).  \n4: The correct answer can be determined via a calculation. If Lloyd currently has 200 cards, Michael needs 100 cards more, and an extra 60 is needed to reach 1000 in total (for Lloyd to have 100, Michael to have 140, and then Lloyd to have 200 altogether).  \n5: Hence, we need an extra 340 cards.

{"text": "1., The question asks the volume of a box with certain height, width, and length dimensions.\n2. The volume formula is V = L * W * H, where V refers to the volume in cubic inches and L, W and H represent the length, width, and height.\n3. To calculate the volume, we need to use the dimensions provided in the question. Let's start by finding the area of the base, or the dimensions across the shortest side of the box.\n4. The width and height of the box each measure '3' inches, and the length measures '4' inches.\n5. When the sides of a box are each a multiple of the height, the combined dimensions can be represented as a series of the heights.\n6. The perimeter of the base is thus 12 + 4 (inches), which equals 16.\n7. The area of the base is equal to the length of the base multiplied by the height, which is 16 * 3 = 48. The volume of the box can thus be calculated as:\nV = L * W * W = 4 * (3 * 4), which equals 54 cubic inches.\n8. The correct answer is the one that maximizes the value of all the terms in the formula, which is C: 54. The volume is found by multiplying 12, which is the height, by 4 since the width is the same as the height.\n9.

The options \"A. 30\", \"B. 77\", and \"C. 134\" seem to be irrelevant and are eliminated.\n3. Next, we must break down the given question into simpler parts to find a logical answer. Given the answer, \"847\", we can see that each ship must include a minimum of two people and have doubled in size over time. Furthermore, the deep-sea monstress has only eaten three ships' worth of people since the earliest recorded case.\n4. Thus, the answer is to simply double the number of people eating and the total amount eaten. Given this, we should multiply \"30\" by \"2\"to obtain \"60\" and multiply \"77\" and \"2\" to obtain \"154\".

{"text": "1.) The initial question asks how many ounces of a particular soda Peter bought after paying $.50 and having $.00 to buy soda with. \n2.) This question can be broken down into two simpler problems: \na. How much soda Peter could buy with the $2, or, how many.25 ounces of sode could Peter have bought with $2. \nb. How much soda did he buy with the change, or, how much change did he have to buy the remaining amount.\n3.) Looking at the question as a whole, the information given does not tell us if Peter bought one soda or 5, how many of the remaining.25 ouncers there are in the new amount of $.50 or whatever else.\n4.) The only way to narrow it down is to get the answers to both smaller portions of the question and then figure out what the final answer is.\n5.) The smaller question is \"how much soda could Peter buy with the $2\". \n6.) This question can be answered with a little math since the cost of the soda is $.25 an ouncer. \n7.) To find how many ounces/ouncers Peter could buy with $2, simply divide 2 by 0.25 to find the solution. \n8.) So the answer to the smaller problem is \"1.0\" ounces/ounces of soda.\n9.) The remaining problem is \"how much sodo did he buy with the.50 change\". \n10.) Since he bought \"1.0\" and left with $.50, that leaves him with.50 - 1.0 = -.50, leaving him with.50.\n11.) And since he spent a lot of money and didn't waste anything in the process, he will have -0.50 + change = 0.50.\n12.) Then, as the two problems are solved, the final answer is \"0.50\" ounces of sodo.\nSo the final answers is 0.50\n\nInput: Can a person's height ever be negative?

{"text": "1. The question asks how many cups of food Herman needs to feed the birds for all 3 months of December, January, and February.\n2. We know that Herman feeds the birds twice a day, once in the morning and once in the afternoon.\n3. From the statement, we can assume that the amount of food given at each feeding is a 1/2 cup.\n4. To solve the question, we can simplify it by rounding the amounts of food given in cups for each month.\n5. Let us assume that for one month, the number of cups of food given in the morning is c1 and the number of cups given in the afternoon is c2. \n6. We will find the sum of the cups c1 and c2 given for that month.\n7. Let's try to solve for January. The amount of food given in the afternoon on January 1 will be c2.\n8. For example, if c2 is 1.5 cups, the amount given on January 1 will also be 1.5 cuffs of food.\n9. Similarly, the amount given in the morning for that day will be c1, which is again 1.5 cuppers.\n10. So, the total cups of food given for January are c1+c2 and will be equal to 3.\n11. After that, same logic will be applied to feed the birds in February and March.\n12. The total cups of food required for all 3 months to feed the birds in the morning and in the afternoon will be 3+3+3, or 9 cups.\n13. Therefore, the answer is 9.\nSo the final answers are E: 9 cups.", "answer": " 90"}

The number of pets cannot be 2.\nOption E: The same logic as for A, but twice as many fish should make twice as many fish.\nOption B: The option clearly states the total number of pants is smaller than the total number of cats and dogs. The total should not be able to exceed 33.\nOption C: Here, the total number of cows (fish) exceeds the total number of hens, which should not be possible.\nOption D: This doesn't explicitly state a contradiction, so we cannot eliminate it.\nFrom here, we need to find the contradiction.

Choices: \n    A: North America\n    B: South America\n    C: South Pole\n    D: South America\n    E: North Pole\nOutput: 1) The question is asking which is the correct answer of North and South Poles. 2) As North and South Poles are the two opposite points on Earth's rotation axis. 3) The axis does not run vertically down through the centers of the planet; rather it is skewed about 23.5\u00b0 off the vertical. This means north and south are at different points on Earth than where the north and south poles are and so the north and south poless on the Earth doesn't necessarily mean north and south poles on the planet. 4) Since the south pole is on the South continent and the north pole of the Earth will not exist as it will not lie on a single continent so as to represent it 5) Since only the option C represents that it lies on the South Pole 6) The answer is therefore C.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "1) It can be assumed that Simon bought pansies, hydrangea, and petunia in order to get flowers that his mum could plant for Mother' Day. If these were in order, total amount to be paid should be $28.25 i.e. $20 + $8.25.\n\n2) Since it is mentioned that Simon paid with $50 bill, he has paid $50 more than the total amount of all the flower he bought. Thus, he has paid a total amount of $88.25 (20 + 28 +10)\n\n3) It can be deduced from the given statement that he received change of $2.85 (10/50 * 88.25 - 88.20 = 0.25).\nSo, given that he has paid $88.20 and received change of $2, total amount he has paid is $88.22 (88.25-2)\n  \nNote:- \n  - For 3) Given that the total sum should be $88.24, but as 88.24 * 10/50 is 7, total change he should have received would be $3.60 * 10/2(for 10%discount) = 1.80  i.e. total amount would be $88.88 (88.22 + 1.80)\n  - 88.82 = (5*21.96+15*10^5+5*10^(-5))  where 10^5 = 10^5 5 = 10 ^-5 i.e. it could be either (-5) or (+5)\n  - The last of the choices of 88.88 could be 88.80 and this isn't a valid option.

The first three terms of the weight sequence are represented by A, C, and (A + C). 3.) Therefore, the fourth term (A + C) must be A + A + C. 4.) It can be observed, the third term A is also the first term (A + C). A + A + C, therefore, equals 2(A + C), i.e., (2 * A + 2C). But (2 * A) + (2C) = (2 * (A + (2 * C)) = (2 * (2 * A)), i.e., (4 * A + 4 * C). 5.) The first and third terms are A & A + C. The middle term is C(1). Therefore the middle term is (C x 1) = C + C = C. 6.) Add A + A + C + C (last) = 2A is 38 lbs. 7.) The answer is B. 38 Pound.\n\nSo the final the final answer 38 lbs", "answer": " 46"}

This scenario raises the question of calculating the cost of five ounces, two ounces, and five pennies. \n3. Since we have been told there are a total of 21 dollars, we can determine how much each ounce, ounce, and penny cost, respectively.\n4. To find the cost of an ounce, multiply ounces by its cost in dollars (21 dollars). \n5. The value of an ounce is then (5 ounces \u00d7 ($21/5)) for $11.20.\n6. Since there are two ounces (2 * 5), their total cost is $22.40.\n7. Finally, the cost of five pennies is $0.05 \u00d7 5 = $0.25. \n8.

It's possible to travel a given distance in a reasonable amount of time, but if the speed is too slow, the time may be too long.\n2.) An object's speed is more important because it describes how fast the object is moving, and this can be used to measure the distance traveled. 3.) Also, time can be used to measure distance, but in most cases, an object's speed is a more direct measure.\n4.) When measuring an object traveling at a given speed, time is often used as a reference.\n5.) By measuring speed, it is possible to estimate how long it will take for an object to travel that distance.\n6.)

In order to find the weight of Karen's tote bag, we need to write the sum of those two weights as a ratio and solve for Karen's totem bag.\n5. Since we know that the weight of Karen tote and briefcase are both 8 pounds, we can plug in those values and divide by 2.\n6. We get, 8 divided by 2 = 4.\n7. Therefore 4 is the weight of Karen bag.\n8. Let's now solve Kevin's briefcase and laptop by substituting in our knowledge of what's in his briefcase and laptop for these terms.\n9. Since we know that Kevin's briefcase (1) contains twice the weight of Karens' tote and contents, we can divide by 2 and simplify.\n10. The result is 8 divided by 4 = 2 pounds.\n11. We know that the work papers make up a sixth of the contents of his briefcase. We know from above that a sixth of those contents are 2 pounds. How many pounds are they?\n12.

Total number of people: 10\n5. Number of people who want to go: 10\n6. So the total = 30 * 10/10 = $ 300\n7. Now the question asks, how much amount of money is left after paying for people to go to the pool?\n8. The answer is, it cost them $ 300 to go to the Pool ( which is a total revenue)\n9. Which means they have $ 30 left to spend on something else.\nSo the final answer for this question is $ 30", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "Step by Step Answer\nStep 1: The first step is to determine the profit made by the production company.\nStep 2: The second step is to analyze the data provided and to determine the cost of producing the movie.\nStep 3: The third step involves calculating the overall profit earned by the production company by multiplying the cost of producing the film by 60, and then adding the total revenue earned after subtracting the cost of production from the total revenue. This will give an estimated profit of $120,000,000 x 60% = $72,000,\n000.\n Step 4: Once the profit is calculated, it is vital to validate the solution by determining if the total profit is above or below 60%. \nStep 5: A final step involves confirming if the total profit is indeed $72,0,000.\nSummarized Answer: The production company earned a profit of $72,0.0000 by producing the movie with a total cost of $60,0000. \nSo the final answer to: A new movie get released and makes 120 million in box office for its opening.

However, we can further subdivide the marketing time into its parts.\n3: The marketing time is divided into one part that is equal to the total time spent on customer outreaching and another that is half of that time. The marketing total time is 10 so the marketing time that is equal to the time on customer outreaching is 6 which is also 60 percent of the time as 10 is 60% of the given marking total time.\n4: The total time of one marking part is 10. The time on advertisement is also 6 which can be calculated using the part ratio.\n5: If the ratio of the time that is equal to customer outreach to the time for advertisement in terms of percentage is 60:40 then the time on advertisement can be calculated to be (10*40)/(60*40) = 25% of the marketing time i.e. the time on advertisements is 25/2.\n6: The calculation of the time for marketing posts can be simplified to be ((10-6)/5)*4 hours, which comes to 2 hours.

{"text": "1 The question gives us the total amount of rain that fell in a week (in inches), along with the individual rainfall amounts on several days throughout that week. The answer lies in determining the daily average rainfall for the week, which is a critical step in solving this problem.\n2. To begin, the question gives us the total rainfall (in inches) for the week in terms of the individual amount on each day.\n3. Based on this information, we first subtract the smallest amount of rain (2 inches) from the highest amount of rain (Monday and Friday total) (5 inches) to get 3 inches as the difference.\n4. From this information, we can now make a conjecture about the daily average rainfalls.\n5. To determine the daily average rainfills during the week, we first need to subtract 1 inch from the cumulative weekly rainfall. This step ensures that our average daily rainfalls will always be positive.\n6. We then divide the remainder from the subtraction step by the total number of days in the week (5), which gives us our daily average rainfall (0.5 inches).\n7. We can use this information to determine the total weekly rainfall of 8 inches, as the sum of each day's daily average and the individual amount on each given day.\n8. The daily average was 0.5 inches for the week, which was combined to 8 inches. This information can be used to determine the actual total daily rainfall from start to finish for the week (8).\n9. Therefore, in order to answer the question and calculate the daily rainfall average for the week, divide the total rainfall of 5 by the number of days in the given week (7). This will then provide the answer in inches.\nSo the final average daily rainfall for the whole week is 0.714 inches. The answer is 0.75.\nSo the final amount for daily rainfall is 1 inches.\nSo the daily rainfall in inches is 0.706\n\nInput: When a restaurant is full, they may place a sign on the door that reads \u201cfull\u201d to keep others from entering.

If there are 6 people in a group and each bag weighs just under this much weight, how many bags of luggaged weight does this group?\nOutput:\n1. The question asks how many bags of total luggage weight does this group have.\n2. Assume the individual weights for 6 people are = 62 and the total weight of luggage carried by all 6 people are 100 pounds.\n3. The solution to this problem is to determine the number of bags of total lugged weight that can be carried by the given amount of luggage.\n4. To determine how many bags of 100 pounds of total luggage can be taken by any group, you need to first know how much weight can one bag take.\n5.

Note that 2.2 is an even number and that it is not divisible by 2. A value that is not divisible by two is called a remainder. Since the amount of desserts is distributed equally among people, each person should receive a remainder, equal to 19.\n5. We can solve this problem by rounding off a fraction and applying rounding rule 19 and 2.5 to ensure each person gets the same amount of desserts.\n6. Based on the equation, we can see that the number of people should be 3 and the amount of cookies should be 0.4.\n7.

{"text": "1) We can draw a graph to solve this problem. 2) The independent variable is the left street length (variable \"L\"). The dependent variable is the number of flyers Donna drops off. 3) To help visualise the problem, we start by drawing an imaginary line to represent the distance Maisie walked down the left street. The independent variable (L) is plotted on the x-axis. Then, we draw a line to represent the dependent variable, which we will label as y, as it is number of flyers dropped off. Now, we need to determine how many flyers Donna dropped off at each house, which is the height (y) of our line.\n4) Using the graph, it can be determined that the number of flyers dropped at each position on the x axis is y. For example, at the bottom right corner, the house is 33 and the amount of flyers is 5. We see that for every two meters up the left street, there were 5 more flyers.\n5) When the independent variable increases by one (1 unit), the dependent variable (flyers dropped) increases by 5. This graph describes the growth of flyers from an initial y = 0. Therefore, for y = x + 1; x = y-1. The y = x + 5 = 5 + y - 1 = y - 6. When y = L - 6, the dependent variable = 10. Therefore, the most number of flyers Don has placed is 10. 6) Now, Donna had already placed 6 flyers. Therefore, the total number of flyers is 10.

{"text": "1: This question asks about the chances of Jack catching either Zika virus or Malaria after getting bitten by a mosquito, considering that he is taking the malaria vaccine. \n2: Firstly, we need to calculate the chances under the situation when Jack does not take the malaria vaccination. \n3: This is calculated by multiplying the percentage of mosquitos that are infected with Malaria by Jack's location with the percentage chance of getting infected with malaria without a vaccine. 40% * 50% = 20%. Jack has a 20% chance of contracting Malaria after being bitten by an infectious mosquito. \n4: The question mentions that 20% of mosquitos are infested with the Zika virus. Thus, 20% is multiplied by the percentage of mosquitoes infected with Zika to get 10%. 40% (Mosquitoes infected by malaria) * 10% (The Zika virus) = 4\n5: After calculating the number of mosquito bites with malaria and without it, we can further deduce that there are 60% chances of Jack in getting malaria if, without the vaccination.

Given this context, the question requires us to determine the difference between the prices offered by the different stores.\n3. The first option, \"$150\", is incorrect as it is not a percentage of the price but a difference in the final price. The question did not ask us to subtract the prices of both options. \n4. The next option, \"$40\", is incorrect as the question does not ask us to find the percentage difference between the prices offered.\n5. The third option, \"\u20ac30\", is incorrect as percentage difference and the number difference between the two prices.\n6. The fourth option, \"20%\", is incorrect as it doesn't take into account the discount offered by both stores. Sara is looking for the difference in price, meaning any discount should be taken into consideration, as the question states that she can apply a discount of 5% and 6% at the respective stores.\n7. The fifth option, \"10%\", is incorrect for the same reason as the fourth option.\n8. Consequently, the only option that is both mathematically correct while simultaneously taking into account Sara's options to apply discounts is $40.\n9. The answer to the question is $40. The difference between the two prices Sara is considering is $40. Sara can use either a discount of 6% or 5% or any combination of both for both stores to arrive at the final price.

In this question, we can find the numbers to replace x and z. We have: 50 + 2*50 = 100, so x = 50.\n3. Now that we've found the value, lets substitute it (50) on the formula again to find y. 50 * 2 = 100.\n4. Substituting 50 for x, lets us re-arrange the formula as:\n5. y = ((100 * 2) - (50))/2\n6. We now need to find the value of y.\n7. Lets substitute the value of x (50). ((100*2)-50) = -50\n8. Now that we have the value of y, we can plug in the the numbers found in the question (50 / 2 + 50 / 2) to find the value for z. Z = 100 - y.\n9. So now we have 3 equations based on the values provided in the problem. (50/2)+ (50/2) + (y/2) = 10 +10 + (100-y).\n10.

Firstly, it's important to understand that the snake's length is measured in inches, not feet or any other unit. \n3. The first part of the problem is to understand that Jake's sne is longer than Jenny'e snake, which is given in the problem statement.\n4. We can rewrite the question statement as follows: \n    $$\"(l_n-x)+x=\\frac{(l_n+l_m)}{2}$$\n    where x = length of Jenny's sneh\n5. $12$ can be subtracted from both left and right sides of the equation, which gives: \n$x-12=-\\frac{l_m}{2}$\n6.

This amount is then added to the bill to get the total of $42.30.\n3) A similar approach can be used to calculate the total bill when the total bill is more complicated. For example, suppose that Yvette's bill for a hamburger dinner and soft drink combo was $8.95 plus 5.5% sales tax for a total of $9.45.\nHamburger meal = $8.95 Sale tax = $0.55 Total = $9.40\n4) This approach takes into account the discount of 5.5% that applies to the meal and adds that to the tax to get the total price of $9.40.\n5) The 20% tip is then applied to the meal and tax to get a total of $10.62, which includes the tip.\n6) This approach is helpful when considering the total bills for multiple items as it takes into account any discounts or taxes that may apply.\n7) By working through this type of problem using these steps, Yvette can calculate that her final bill would be $42.3 + $2.7 = $44.2, showing that her bill after the 20% gratuity is $41.60.\nSo the final explanation is $41.80\n\nInput: If the number was an \"even\" number, or if the number was an \"odd\" number?

We can replace \u201cbought at\u201d with the word \u201csold\u201d to find the bike he bought for 20% of the bike he sold, which is also equal to 40% of its sale price.\n4: From the toaster cost at 10 dollars he bought for 150 cents.\n5: We then have to find the difference between the total price of the bought items and their prices individually. \n6: The bike he bought for $400 is also worth $700, so he bought a second bike of the same price.  For this, he spent $3000, which is 9 times the $300 that makes up the 700, which is a profit of $400.  The 500 is a profit of $200, the other bike costs him 400 cents, and the remainder is $150 cents after the toaster.\n7: So we have 0 plus $200 plus (2/3 of 400), which is $265 plus $300 plus (400/3) (not a 1/3) which is $197, plus $150 (remainder) plus $10 more for the toaster.  \n8: We arrive at a final value of $1803 by rounding off all the numbers 0-3.

This indicates that we should pay extra attention to the word \"lost\" and consider the correct placement in the sentence.\n3. First, let's look at some of the options that do not fit with the word \"lost.\" The expressions \"turned white\" and \"turned pale\" are incorrect because the prefix \"pale\" means \"light-colored.\"\n4. Moreover, these terms do not refer to changing in color, but rather to \"fading\" or \"getting tired.\"\n5. The options \"turning yellow\" and \"turning green\" describe changing in color, but the word \"turn\" has been previously used in the sentence, so this makes these options unlikely.\n6. The remaining options - \"turning blue\" and \"turning purple\" - are the most relevant.\n7. In the context of the given sentence, \"turning purple,\" which denotes an extreme shade of red, is the more suitable answer.\n8. Purple is a shade of red that is a deeper, darker, and cooler shade than red and nearer to blue.\n9.

For $100, he buys 4 bottles of drinking water. \n5. Let us say after Jack buys the 4 bottles of $2, he has $79. Thus, the total spending so far: $79 X 4 = $316.\n6. After buying a total of $316 in drinking water, Jack's mother calls him to go buy 24 bottles of drink.\n7. Using the same math as before, if he spends $316 on 4 water, then for $316 * 10, he will need to buy 10 water.\n8. The bottles of water are the same $2 price, but he gets 10 water for $20 - which equals $10 less.\n9. Therefore, for $316, he could have purchased 10 water - or he could have purchased 24.\n10. The last thing Jack buys is a pound of chees, which is $10 - but the math needs to be calculated a bit.\n11. If Jack bought 24 water bottles, and 1 cheese = $10, then for 10 water = $20, Jack is left with $140 for cheese.\n12. If Jack bought 10 water bottles, and he got 1 cheese = 1 cheese =$10, then Jack is left with $20 for cheese.

In this scenario, there are 3 possible answers: X = 1, X = 2, and X = 0.\nWe are given in the question that Paul watches 2 movies that are on average 1.5 hours long, which means the total number of hours Paul watches movies is 3 hours. This means, Paul watches for 3 hours and runs for 1 hour. That is to say, the amount of time Paul watches movies and does nothing else is equal to 3 hours.  As a result, the amount of time he runs is equal to 1 hour.\nGiven Paul runs on his tredmil that takes 12 minutes to run a mile in his given scenario, in order to run for an hour, he must run for 6 miles.

Therefore, the total number of water, flour and salt cups is 46 cups + 10 cups \u2013 8 teaspoons = 58 cups. \n3) To make it easy to understand and solve the problem, we start by simplifying the number of ingredients as 10 cups x 16 cups x 2 teaspoons.\n4) By applying mathematical operations, we come up with the following expression - (10 cups x (16 cups \u00f7 46 cups - 8 teaspoon)) - 10 cups. \n5) This can be simplified to - (16 cups x (1 - 46)) - 10 (16 - 8). \n6) Next we simplify by subtracting 16 from both sides.

Berries were eaten during summer, acorns in autumn, and salmon in the next season.\n4. The bear feasts on berry and small woodland animal during the summer, devours acorns during autumn, and eats half the remaining weight in salmon over time.\n5. Solving for the total amount of the weight gained in all categories, we can find the answer by adding these values together:\nSummer: 1000 + 500 + 5 = 2075 pounds\nAutumn: 2075 + 2000 = 4075 pounds\nWinter: 0 + 200 = 2000\n6. Hence, the bear gained a total of 6075 pounds during the various food groups.\n7. We want the amount the bear gained from eating small animals, which came after it ate acorns and berries.\n8. Using the information given in the question, we can find the total weight of the small animals eaten by the bear. These animals were 25% of the remaining weight to be gained by the bear. They only accounted for half of the weight gained by the bear in the final season, which means that they accounted for 46.5% of the remaining amount.\n9.

Jeff then skipped 4 more skips than Sam in the round.\nJeff got tired and only completed 50% of the skipping actions as Sam in the last skipping competition round.\n\n3) If Sam skipped 9 more times than Jeff in the first half of each round, then Jeff only completed 50 % of the total number of skips that completed as Sam.

{"text": "1. \n2. This question is designed to evaluate students' ability to solve mathematical problems.\n3. The first part of the problem, \"Stella and Twinkel are filling up a trruck with a capacity of 250 BPH per person\", refers to the rate at which the blocks were being filled, with 6000 blocks being the capacity and 4 hours being the total time it took. As the problem indicates, the initial 2 workers, Stella and Twinkle, only did 4 hours' work, but they were joined by 6 more (for a total of 20 workers). \n4. Each worker is adding 250 BPS to the truck. This means that the capacity of the truck is being filled at a rate of 25 BPS per hour. Thus, the first 4 hours took a total of 2 * 25 BPS, or 50 BPH.\n5. The second part, which asks how many hours it took to fill the truck, can be evaluated based on the data provided:\n6. The total time taken to fill the truck is 4 * 250 BPI, or 1000 BPH.\n7. Thus, the total number of workers is 7, resulting in 2 * 100 BPH, or 200 BPH being taken to fill the trunk.\n8. Additionally, the total capacity taken was 6,000, resulting in a time taken of 600 BPH.

It's important to note that this estimated value may increase as additional details about the towel usage patterns of the families, or household members, are taken into account. \n4.\nWe also know that the washing machine can hold a maximum of 14 towels per load, which means that it can handle 10 loads, or 140 towels, in total. \n5.\nTo calculate the number of loads required, we can use the following formula:\n1 load = total number of towls / maximum towls per load (140/14) => 10 loads.\n\n6.\nThus, to answer the question, we can say that the number of washing machine loads required to wash the total number of towel is 10.\n\nSo the final answer for the family was 10 loads or 10 batches of laundry.\n\nInput:\nA woman's hat is a sphere, her scarf is a cylinder, her coat is a triangle, and her handbag is a cube.

{"text": "1)Let's first answer this question with the assumption that the tree is not cut.\n2)The height of a tree of a certain species is dependent on where that species grows. For example, a tree in the Amazon rainforest is different from a tree in Antarctica. Different conditions affect how tall trees grow.\n3)So, we need to specify under what conditions our tree grows and if we consider conditions like weather or the amount of water present, we need to add in a lot more complexity by introducing factors like the climate, temperature, humidity, and even whether it's raining or not.\n4)After all, the tree would grow differently in a forest versus on a desert island.\n5)However, this question doesn't ask that. So let's keep it simple.\n6)Here, we are talking about tall trees like sequoias or redwoods that are found in the northwestern United States on the Pacific coast (specifically in California and Oregon).\n7)These tall trees (Sequoia sempervirens) typically grow between 92 and 136 feet.\n8)In contrast, the trees in the lower part of the United States tend to be short. \n9)These tall trees don't grow at the same rate of about 3.65 to 11 inches per year.\n10)Also, our tree does not appear to be growing as fast as a regular tree.\n11)So, the answer is A: 30.93144432309772 years.\n12)This means that if it started growing at the end of 11/2017, then it would have reached a height of 136 feet, or 41.45 meters by the end of 21 / 2019.\nSo the final is A: 31.\n\nGiven the following information about the class, which of the following statements is true?\n(1 Point)This is a basic linear equation, it cannot describe real-life situations that can change every year.\n(1 Point)The line with the equation 9x-4y = -6 shows that for any combination of x and y, the values of x and y have to satisfy certain conditions in order to produce a positive outcome.\n(", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "1: We start by understanding the statements and equations to determine the age of Ironman if Thor is aged 1456.\n\nThe first statement: Thor is 3 times older than Captain American and hence 13 times older if he was 4 times older than Captain American. This can be understood as it's 3 times Captain American but also 13 times Captain American, adding up to 1456 times Captain American.\n\nThe second statement: Captain American is 3 times older that Peter Parker, so Captain American is 7 times older if he was thrice older than Peter Parker.\n\nWith Thor being 13 times older, Captain American is 13 times less then his age. Put Captain American's age as 1 minus 13 or 9 times his actual age.\n\nThe third statement: Ironman is thrice older than Peter. Peter is 8 times younger than Ironman. Hence Ironman is 1 time older than Captain Marvel if he is thrice older.\n2: With Thor being 13 older, Captain is thrice older and then Captain is 1 time older, so Captain is 3 times what he was. Thus, Captain is 12 times older than Peter Parker. Adding a Captain's age as a minus will be the age of Captain minus 12 (this is done as it's already included in the first and second statement).\n\nThe third statement Ironman is thrice aged Peter and hence is 8 times less than Ironman's age. Ironman's age becomes 2 minus 8 5 times his actual age. \n\n3. Summarizing the statements, we have 12 less Thor's age than Captain's age, and that 5 times Thor's age.\n\n4. We plug the values in place of the variables and the formula of division by remainder becomes: Ironman's age = Thor's age -12, remainder 5. Thus, Ironman is 11 years old if Thor is 12 years older.\nSo the final ans : Thor's age=12, Captain's age=13\n5. Ironman's equation is: Thor's age - 12, remainder 7 = 11\nSo the final ans = Ironman is 12, Captain'sh age=13", "answer": " 48"}

That means the pickers must pay 20 to get the strawberries. \n4. Next let's look at the question itself.we have 3 people pay $128. That means they paid a total of 40 to get the strowberry. \n5. Now we have 40-20 = 20. \n6. Now we can see that each person gave $20 for the strawberry harvest. The same 20 and the 48 the first one got for 20+20.\n7. From all that.we have solved the whole problem.\nSo the final answer: 2 pounds\n\nInput:At the end of each quarter, the manager reports on the company\u2019s sales. This past quarter, the sales rose by a total of 7 percent. During this quarter, the sales increased by 2.2 percent in January, climbed 3 percent in February, and went up by 4 percent in March. Which of these months did not have rising sales? Choices : A: February B: March C: January D: All of the above\nOutput: 1  :First answer for question :B : 2.2 percent, 3 percent and 4 percent have a value in common so it makes it the biggest possible gap.\n2.Now we can figure out how big the gap is between 2.2 percent and 3 and 4.we can figure it out by subtracting the first one from the second and third one.\n3. So the answer from first step is 0.8, from that we have to subtract 8 from 0.8.It means 7+1 =8.we divided it to 7 because 2 and 4 has a biggest value.\n4. So one of the most probable options from the first set of options is March.\nSo the answer is :D: March.\nInput: What is the sum of 16.5 +", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": "1) First of all, we can eliminate the choice E, as it is an imaginary (or impossible) value. So we have options {17.5, 19.5, 20.5, 21.5}.\n2) Using the information we\u2019ve received from the question, we can narrow in on the options. We know that in the first 15days of november, the rainfall is approx. 72 inches in total in the given month. So, option 21.5 and 20.5 are not possible.\n3) Now, we can look into the second part of the question, where the average daily rainfal is 4 times the rainfal during the first 14 days. The average daily rainfal here is 4 times the amount of the first 15, multiplied by the 2nd 15, which is 20, and 4.8, which is the rainfall during the period of the second 15 days. The rainfal after 30 days can be calculated as { 4*15 + 28 + 8*28 }, which gives us 30.5, which falls in choice 19.5.\n4) Answer is 30.5.\nInput: A pizza parlour had a day off yesterday to prepare for the opening of their new location.

What is the probability that one of the students at their old location has not found a new school within two years?\nOutput:  The answer is 1/6. It is justified based on the problem statement, as the problem asks for the probability that a student at an old location has not found another school within two years.\n1) The pizza parlour had had a day off yesterday. This means that two years has elapsed after the pizza parlour had provided food for the school at their old location. So that's why we are looking for the probability that the students have not found new schools after the pizza parlours had stopped providing food.\n2) A student can find a new school within two year, or it might not find.

In fact, given that each bottle of champage holds up to 4 quarts, he actually buys 4-quart bottles. \n8. To find how much champagne he can afford, we need to determine the total cost of this quantity of champagne. This cost depends on whether he purchases this quantity in 4-quarts or in smaller quantities of 1 quart.\n9. The cost in 1-quart quantities depends on how many 1-quart bottles he needs to purchase: 40 gallon - n quarts = n bottles, n > 4.\n10. Therefore, to buy the requested volume of champagne in smaller quantities of 4 quarts, the minimum number of bottles he needs to buy is n' = 16, (40 gallons minus the number of gallons he expects to purchase.)\n11. The minimum cost of champagne he can afford with the above discount, when buying his champagne in smaller quantities, is (16 gallons -16 gallons * 0*4) * 1/4*4*50 \u2248 3833 dollars. \n12. The minimum cost of the champagne in 4 -quart bottles that he can afford with the same discount is ((40 gallons -16 quarts)*1/4*4", "answer": " 6400"}
{"text": "1) The given question deals with the calculation of James's amount of ownership according to the given information.\n2) The first step is to identify the relationship between James and Ali's ownership.\n3) This involves using the information provided that James owns $250 and Ali owns $110 more than James to formulate a mathematical equation to represent this relationship.\n4) One way of approaching this would be to add James' and Ali's ownership together to find out the total amount they own, which can then be divided by two since they own the money together.\n4) Another approach would be to use division to find out the amount James owns relative to Ali's ownership. This would involve subtracting Ali's ownership from $250 to find out the amount remaining with James and dividing it by the amount taken away to give an idea of the proportion of James' ownership compared to Ali's ownership ($250 - $110 =$140, so $140 \u00f7 $110 = 0.125).\nSo let's start with the option that involves finding out the total amount they have:\n\n5) To calculate the total amount the two together own, we simply write down the expression 250 + 110 = 360; this is the total amount owned by James and Ali.\n6) Afterwards, we split the total value given in the option equally between James and Ali and subtract the amount of money James holds to find the amount James has left, which is: $(360/2) \u2212 $110= $140.\n7) Now, let's divide $110 by $140 to get the proportion of Ali's ownership compared to James' ownership.\nWe can calculate it by dividing $140 by $110 and getting 0.129, or the approximation 12.9%.\nTherefore, the answer to the question is $110/1270=0.045, or approximation 4.55%.\nThus, the amount owned by James is 4.55 times his money($40), which is $172.\nSo the final option is 172.\n\nInput:If someone was driving home and you were to give them directions", "answer": " 145"}

Output:\n1. Given that Ivan's speed is 5m/h, it would take him 60minutes.\n2. The calculation can be done by applying the following formula:\n\n[x] = [time] x [m/h] = 300 x 5/60\n\n3. This gives us the answer to be 60 minutes.\n4. 5m/h would make it take 45 minutes.\n5. Since Ivan is walking at an average speed of 3 m/h (instead of 5) it would take him an 110 percent time.\n6. This is because the time he would take is 60m (instead of 300m). The time Ivan would take to walk at a speed of 5m/h is 300m x 5/6o.\n         The time Ivan would take with an average speed of 4m/h (instead than 3) would be 400m x 4/6o.\n7. It does not make sense that Ivan walking at an average speed faster than 3 m/h would take longer than walking at 5 m/h since the distance he would cover is smaller.\n8.

{"text": "1.) The question is about calculating the salary of a teacher who works 5 periods a day for 24 days a week throughout a year.\n2.) There are two ways to approach this problem: a.) Work out the total number of hours worked throughout the year by multiplying 24 days by 5 periods per day and 24 hours per day. This yields a total of \\(24 \\times 5 \\times 24 = 2,160\\) hours.\nb.) Alternatively, one could divide the teacher's salary by his hourly rate of $5, obtaining a total of \\(2500 / 5 = 500\\) hours in one month, resulting in a total of \\(6\\times 500 = 3,000\\) hours in six months of work.\n3.) To solve this problem, begin by determining how many periods are in each day. There are typically 10 periods in a day, meaning that the teacher works 50 periods per day and 500 periods per month, resulting in a grand total of \\(500 +500 = 1000\\) periods for the teacher.\n4.) Next, determine the number of days in a year. There are typically 365 days in a year, meaning that there are \\(365 \\times 5 = 1825\\) periods in one year. Combining these numbers, the teacher has worked \\(1000 + 1825 = 2825\\) total periods, or \\(24 \\times5 \\times 2825 \\approx 0.75 \\times 2500 = 2062.50\\) hours in one year and \\(2062. 50 \\times $5 \\approx \\$ 10,312.50\\) in total salary.\nSo the final amount is about $10,313.\nSo the final result is that the teacher has worked 1825 periods for 2825 hours and earned about $10,000 in total for about $10, 315.\nSo the final output is $10,354\nInput: The astronaughts found that Earth used to be much closer to Sun hundreds of years ago and that", "answer": " 3600"}

{"text": "1) We first look at the question to understand what it's asking. It's asking how much Melissa or Tolu will spend altogether. From the question, it's clear that it's Melissa who is spending the most and Tolu or Robert the least. Let's put Melissa first as our example. Melissa is going to spend 20 cents * 3 = 60 cents.\n2) Next, we look at the question again, and notice that Robert wants 5 pcs and Tolu just 3. So let's put them next to Melissa as our examples. Let's say 2 cents because 0.02 is very small. So you have, Melissa = 60, Robert = 0.02 and Tolu = 0.03\n3) Finally, I like to leave these questions because they are the easiest questions to get stuck on. If we've left them out, you can move on to the next questions.\n3) So if we want to figure out how much the total purchase will be, we simply add up all the expenses for the 3 of them. That gives us 64 (60 + 0.02 + 0.03).\n3) That's all. If you've gotten that far, you got it!\n3) Let's see how that breaks down:\n64 cents will be spent on students on Tolu, Robert and Melissa will spend 64 together, and Robert and Tolu will each spend 0.02 cents. Putting it in our question, 64 is the amount that they want to spend together.\n3) You can see that in all the questions, answers are always a whole number.

We will then draw straight lines for $150, $160, $170... and so on for whatever number it takes to cover the remaining part of the roofing. \n2) To find the total price of the metal roofing, we need to add up the values of all the segments that were not given for free. So we have to draw the line from $150 to $450 to cover the remaining parts of the building. \n3) Since the last number will be drawn on the right side of the original line, it will be drawn on $8. After that, we will use the second line to draw the remaining values from $390 to $452. These values add up to $452 - $390 = $62. \n4) Since the last line is drawn on the top right side of the first line, it will be divided into four smaller segments. \n5) So adding up the value of $8, $150, and $62 will give us $220.

There are two main pieces of information given in the question- 500 customers and the customers will purchase 2 heads of lettuces and 4 tomatoes at some price.\n3. We can start trying to answer the question by subtracting 2 from 500- because we have 500 customers, and each customer buys only 2 lettuces and 2 tomatoes. We get 498.\n4. We know that each lettuce costs $1, so the total expenditure in lettuces must be $498 dollars.\n5. Now, we go for option F that says customers buy 4 tomatoes each at $0.50, while the total tomato purchases are $498.\n6. So, the total amount of tomatoes that the customers bought is 2,496 and each tomato costs $0.50.\n7. At this stage, we can conclude that the total amount that customers will spend on tomatoes in a month are $1,248.\n8. Therefore, the total amount that the customers will spend total on lettuce and tomatoes is $1,674.\n9. So the monthly sales revenue is $1,617.

So, the number of people waiting can be calculated as follows: The total number of possible passengers in a train station- The number of passengers who do not board the train and/or are not waiting for a specific train. This solution can be used to answer questions like \u201cHow many people arrived by train and how many people are waiting for a train?\u201d or \u201cHow many passengers are waiting for specific trains?\u201d\n\nInput: The number of people that participated in the survey was 39. The numbers 81 and 19 were among the participating people.\nOutput: 81 and 94 as the answer. 81 was among the participating survey participants, so that would be the correct number.\nAnother set of numbers that could potentially be included in the survey is 94. This 94 is one of the numbers that was also counted in the survey. Therefore, the two numbers that are possible answers to this question are 81 and", "answer": " 10"}

In other words, each screen shows 3 movies throughout the day.\n7) We can simplify by noting that 3 movies x 1 screen = 3 movies, for each screen throughout the day.\n8) There are 6 screens, so all of the screens can show a total of 6 movies.\n9) Next, we will consider the total number of moviegoers.\n10) Let's assume that each screen has a movie going simultaneously, so each screen has 1 movie and the other screen shows the movie from the previous screen.\n11) In total, the movie theater has 2 movies showing at any given time, as each of the 6 screens has at least one movie shown.\n12) If we multiply 2 with 3, we will come up with a total of 6, since 2 movies x 3 screens will show each movie 3 times throughout the day.\n13) We can simplify again by noting that 6 movies x 1 theater = 6 movies, for each theater throughout the day.\n\n14) In summary, there are a total of 6 screens, each with 3 movies, and a total of 6 theaters, each with 6 movies, which brings it to a total of 36 movies shown throughout the day.", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": "It is important to understand the question is asking about the total number of miles walked in 30 days, not in one specific day.\n1. Start by identifying what information is given in the question. These include:\n`Clover goes for a 2-mile walk every single day`\n`he will walk 1.5 miles every morning and 1.5 miles in the evening`\n2. The first statement about Clover's walks implies that we are dealing with a recurring event that happens every single day. Since we are not told how long a week lasts for Clover (for example 7 days a week, or 28 days a month) we need to assume it is a regular week (7 days) and that the walking happens daily.\n3. The second statement further specifies the details of the walks. Specifically, we have `1.5 miles every mourning` and `1.5 miles in evening`.\n4. Based on the given details, we can make the following conclusions. Clover walks:\n    -1.5 miles in a morning and 1. 5 miles in the evening every day.\n    -1. 5 miles mornings, 1.5 miles evening in 7 days (week)\n    -1.625 miles in morning, 1.625 every evening in 7 days.\n5. Based on the given information, it appears that we are asked to find the total number of miles that Clover walks in 30 days. To do this, we start by converting the times to weeks (7 days) and calculate the total miles walked in mornings and evenings in 30 days (from the 30th day until the 59th day).\n   **Morning:**\n    -7 * 1.5 = 10.5 miles [30 = 59]\n   **Evening:**\n     -7 * 15 = 105 miles [30= 59]\n     -1.6245 miles every evening in 30 days\n6.

{"text": "1) First of all, find the total cost of the coffee and milk for one week. \n2) Note that each cup of coffee has 1.5oz of coffee beans and each cup of coffee contains 2 cups of beans as per the coffee per day.\n3) Therefore, 2 cups of cofee = 3 cups of beans and each cup = 1.5 ounce = 18 grams. \n4) In one week, Maddie makes 2 cups each day and each cup contains 18 grams of beans. Therefore, in one week, each day she uses:   `= 18*2 = 36ounces =>`  36*18 grams per day. \n5) In one week, she used 36*36ounces of coffee = 1296oz. Therefore,  10.5 ounce/ounce = 10.5% = 12% = 12/100 = 12% of 1296 ounces = 158.04oz of milk. \n6) Hence, each cuppa coffee = 36ouncsof coffee and 1/2gallon of milk is 32ounces.\n7) Therefore, 36ouncs of coffee /32ounces of milk = 1.1 gallons of milk.

We can't just do division it's important to compare it with something or to simplify it. 1/3 as 0.33 or 0.333 if we compare it in fraction it's 4/12 not sure if you can compare fraction with decimal\n11. 0.33 * 20 = 6.\n12. We found out that Mike didn't ate 20 but he ate 6.\n13. We know that Jenny a ate twice the number that Mike ate so by definition Jenny ate 6 * 2 = 12.\n14. Jenny ate 24 squares. \nSo the final answer 14.\n\nInput: If 6 + 5 = 23 and 10 subtracted from 100 can equal any 4 digit number, what is the value of 12?\nOutput: 92. \n2.

{"text": "1) The question asks how many stickers Paige has left after giving her 3 friends an equal amount of stickers.\n2) To solve the problem, you need to understand the constraints of the problem, namely -\n- Paige has 150 stickers in total - She will give them equally among 3 friends\n- She decides to divide each sheet into two equal groups - Each friend will be given an equal amount of stickets from each sheet\n- So there will be 3 different groups and each group will have 3 friends making a total of 12 different groups\n3) Paige starts giving stickers to her first friend and then gives stickers till the last of her third friend.\n4) For instance if Paige's first friend, asks for 10 stickers, then Paige needs to have at least 10 stickers left for her third friend to give him stickers. So now, Paige will divide the remaining 80 stickers equally among her first two friends and still have 10 stickers for herself.\n5) Hence, there are 4 ways of dividing the remaining 80 sticker equally among her first 2 friends and a last way for dividing the remaining 10 stickers.\n6) There are 4 different possibilities for the remaining 150 stickets -\n7) The first possibility 1 is 50 cat stickets in one group and 100 outer space stickers in the other group. However, this is not feasible as this means Paige will be left with 50 cat stickts and 12 outer space stickers. But as she has 12 different groups, that means each group would have 10 inner space stickers if she divides them evenly. So this would give 12*10=120 stickers to each group and Paige would have nowhere to give 5 more stickers. Hence this is not an option.\n8) Similarly, the second possibility 2 is 100 cat stickers in one group and 50 outer space stickers int he other group. However,this is also not feasible as this creates a similar situation as in the first option. Hence, we can eliminate this possibility as well.\n# So there are only 2 possibilities remaining which are 3 and 4\n9) The 3rd possibility", "answer": " 3"}
{"text": "1) This is a very tricky math question that asks about the amount of food grown and harvested from orchards.\n2) The first step is to identify the fruit that is grown using the given information. The answer is apples and peaches. \n3) The total harvested fruit would thus be the total mass of fruit both apples and peaches gives.\n4) So the question becomes, \"What is the total weight of both apples and peach in the orchard?\".\n5) The mass of apples is given as 150 kg per each apple tree and in total it is 150 x 30 = 4500 kg.\n6) Now, let's calculate the mass of peaches. The mass of peaches are given as an average of 150 kg but it is given per each peach tree. To find the total weight of peach mass, we can multiply the average weight of 65 by the total peach trees of 45. \n7) To find the total mass of the orchard, we now have to add the mass of two fruits, apple and peaches. Total mass apple + total mass peach + total mass remaining = Total mass in orchard.\n8) The equation should be\n\nTotal(Apple + Peach + Mass remaining)/Total apples and peach.\n\n9) The total in mass remaining is only 4500 * 0.1 =275 kg because we are considering two types of fruits and one is already given.\n10) Therefore, the final answer is 4500 + 1612.5 = 6112.5 kg.\n\nSo the final answer it is 6112 kg.", "answer": " 7425"}
{"text": "1)The given question requires us to find the total number of stawberries picked by the family, and to divide it equally among them.\n2) Let's start with the simplest statement: \"8 times\" the amount of strawberry Kimberly picked.\n3) We can eliminate the incorrect answers quickly if we first consider the correct ones.\n4) Looking for the value of \"13\" is helpful because it's the only integer that can replace \"14\" in the equation \"8 times 14 is 112.\"\n5) We have \"8 x 13 = 112\" but \"8 x 12 = 96\" doesn't work.\n6) Since we know \"8 x 14 = 112,\" so this means 112 cannot evenly divide by the \"14\" and \"13\" strawberry Kimberley picked.\n7) Similarly, \"8 x 15 = 120\" does not evenly divide by 14 and 13.\n8) This means that Kimberley can have \"123\" strawberries.\n9) The given equation shows that her brother picked \"3 x 15 =\n11 strawberries.\"\n10) Let's assume her brother's basket is the largest basket, which has 20 strawberries. This makes \"7 strawberries in the middle basket\" and \"5 strawberries\" in the smallest basket.\n11) If we assume that \"93\" strawberrries are picked by her family, we can determine that her parents have\n89 strawberries. Based on this information, we can say that her brother, mother and father can have \"97,\" \"83\" and \"56\" strawberries, respectively.\n12) Based on these, we can calculate that \"164 strawberries\" are left over after everyone has their share, and we can divide it by equal among them.\nSo the final equation is: \"164 \u00f7 4 = 41\" strawberries for Kimberly, her brother, her mother, and her father.\n\n\n\n## \ud611\ub825\uc131\nInput: In which of the following sports is scoring the", "answer": " 168"}

{"text": "1The question can be understood as a simple case of mathematical calculation involving the cost of the shoes based on several factors. \n2. We know that Bobby pays $250 to the cobbler to make the mold for the expensive shoes. \n3. Next, the cobbler charges Bobby an hourly rate of $75 for 8 hours to produce the shoes.\n4. The cobbler offers a discount of 80% on all work-related charges for this project that is below the industry standard rate.\n5. Therefore, the total cost for the shoes comes out to $250 + ($75 * 8) - 80% * $75*(8) = $175.\n6.

E: It would be annoying to know that someone was bothering her cat\nOutput: 1- The sentence \"She would get mad at (whoever) was bothering her cat\" indicates that the \"cat\" is being bothered in some way, but it does not specify who exactly is causing the disturbance. \n2. This implies that the \"she\" in the sentence may be angry at someone, and the word \"whoever\" allows it to refer to multiple people at once. \n3. \"She thought someone should bother the c\n4. At: This choice contradicts the sentence's logic; if \"she\" thinks someone should bother the cat, it contradicts the fact that she becomes mad at whoever bothers the cat. \n5. Therefore, this choice can be eliminated, leaving us with C: She would scould whoever was bothering. \n6. Because the question asks about what the author meant when writing the sentence, the author clearly intended to mean C: She would scolder whoever was bothering, not B: She thought someone shd bother the cat, as this would contradict the rest of the sentence. \n7. Therefore, we can accept the answer C: \"She would scold whoever bothering.\"\n8.

This means that we are looking for a combination that contains 1 or 2 employees. For example, an employee that speaks English and Spanish is an invalid combination, so we subtract it from the total of '40 speak English and at least' '20 don't'. \n3. Next, we can eliminate the unnecessary options. Since at least 20 of the employees do not speak Spanish, the minimum amount should be subtracted from 40 to get the total of '4\nThis can be represented mathematically as follows: English/Spanish speakers = 40 - (40 + 20). \n4.

{"text": "1 The question mentions a \"printer that crumples every 7th page\". It is not clear what type of printer this refers to: a 2-color home printer, an 8-color commercial printer, etc. It is more likely that it refers to a laser printer, as this type of printer is most commonly seen in homes and offices.\n2 The \"7th page\" is referred to as \"page $n$\". In mathematical notation, this would be written as \"p$_n$\".\n3 The number of pages that are not crumpled nor blurred (\"neither crumpled or $b$\") is given by the formula $n_0 = \\frac{42-3}{7-3} = 28$.\n4 If all the pages in a book are printed on one piece of paper, the book would not need to be bound together. In fact, a book with unbound pages is more likely than not to have its spine creased by a corner. (The word \"book\" does not appear in the problem.)\n5 The problem may be changed slightly to make it more clear. For example, it can be stated as follows: \"James has an old printer. If he prints $42$ pages  on one sheet of paper (which will result in unbound pages),  then $3$ pages are crumpled and $3$ pages are blurred.\"\n6 The mathematical symbol for a blurred page is \"blurred\", with an opening parenthesis to indicate this. The variable \"$n$\" represents the sequence of pages printed, starting with 0. A \"$b$\" next to a page number indicates that the page is blurred.\n7 James can print more than $42$ pages on one sheet of paper. For example, he might print a booklet of $42$ pages.\n8 Although only $3$ pages are actually crumpled and blurred, these $3$ pages may represent $3$ consecutive pages that James prints. The only difference is that he might have to fold the paper in half before printing the $3$ pages.\nSo the final answers are 1: The answer to the problem can be summarised as follows: $n_0 = 77 - 3 = 74$ pages are not crumple.

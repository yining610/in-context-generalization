Suppose it costs $4000 to purchase and install an air conditioning system. Select the state whose sales tax rate is closest to the combined tax rate in the system's current cost.\n\n### Response\nTo determine which sales tax rate is most similar in the context of purchasing and installing an air conditioning system, one would need to analyze and compare the total sales tax rate provided from each state. \nOne common scenario that many people would encounter often is the need for an air-conditioner to help them survive warmer and hotter temperatures. Since air-conditioning is considered a necessity by many, sales tax rates on air-conditioning products may vary from state to state due to varying tax codes and rates. \nThe sales tax rates from different states and the associated cost for air-conditioning can provide insight into a person's or family's ability to purchase and install an AC unit. \nTo determine the most similar tax rate, one would need to take the total cost for the air-conditioning unit, $4000, and subtract it from the combined sales tax rate for each state to find the difference between the combined sales tax in each state, ranging from $111 to $183. \nAmong the four states, the closest tax rate to the total sales tax rate is $111, which is from Texas.

Hence, we should first identify to which set we should choose from. We have been given that the four numbers should obey certain characteristics:\nOne higher: this can either be a positive or negative.\nOne lower: similarly, this is either positive or negative.\nSo we know that the second digit has two options: positive or negative.\n\n### One larger: we then require the fourth digit to be either positive or negative. So, we know we have 3 options: positive, negative and positive. The final number, or \"higher/lower,\" is then decided by the second digit (from an above calculation)\n\n### One smaller: Since we have decided on the final number (\"higher/lower\"), we move on to the third digit. It can either be positive or negative, making it the \"2 digit\" required.\n\n### Since these are the \"2 digit zero\", we can use the same logic (from a previous calculation) to determine the first digit. This would be: \n\n### Excluding these as options, we are left with -13, 13 and -12\n\n### Given that the teacher needed only those that fit with their criteria (one higher, one lower etc) we can exclude the latter two as options:\n1. Given that we are only after the four numbers that satisfy the teacher's criteria, we can safely exclude the possibility of -13 or 13 as the higher/lower numbers. To elaborate, if the teacher has already stated he needed one higher, he would not expect the student to give the exact same number as the higher/lower number.\n2.

{"text": "Demonstration:\nChoices:  A: 26 red hats  B: 12 red hats  C: 26 blue hats  D: 12 blue hats\nRationales:\nStart by reading the question carefully.\n1. The problem states Paityn has 2 red and 24 blue.\n2. Zola has 4 blue and 1 red.\n3. The problem continues with them combining their hats and sharing them equally.\n4. The question does not specify how many hats each person has. But from the rest of the information, I can deduce that Paityn must have 20 less hats than Zola.\n5. With that knowledge, I can determine that Paityn shares her original 20 red hts and she and Zola share their remaining combined hats of 84 to distribute hats to them.\n6. Once the calculation of hats is completed, you can divide by 2 to determine the number of red hats Paityn has and the number of red htas Zola has. \n7. As in the previous question, the answer isn't listed among the answers, so I can discard option D.\n8.

Let's use an odd-numbed block as the first block on the walk, from 1 to 9999. That gives us 8 choices. There's 4 corners (not including when he leaves or enters). At the first corner, we'll look at his first choice: Choice A. Now he turns left, he's on an even numbered block, from 2 to 10000. That gives us an additional 4 options. So now we have a total of 11 options, which should give us two options for each side of the corner (excluding the corner itself) and the corners. Each choice is split up in the different order that James is walking on the 6 block path. At the corners, there's no choice and the order doesn't matter.\nChoices with: Odd numbered block, Even numbered block\nA. 1 - 3  B. 5 - 7  C. 8 - 9   D. 4 - 6\nChoices with: Even", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "#### Rationales:\n\n1.  The input doesn't say that \"20\" is the number of each plant, so we can eliminate the choice 'each tree has 20 plans'\n2. We know that he plants 60 % of each seed. Since there are 1 seeds per plant, and there are 60% of these plants, 30% of each plant are left over.\n3. Therefore, we can assume that he plants 30% per plant.\n4. \"Each tree has 20 plan\" means that each tree has 20 seeds in total.\n5. And each seed has a 30% chance to be planted, therefore James plants 60% * 30% =30% of each tree.\n6. Therefore, we can say that from one tree, he plants 20 plants * 30% or 6 plants.\n\nAside from that, we also know that there are two trees, which each has 20 plants *30% = 6 plants. \n\nWe can then conclude that the correct answer is C.\n\n#### Explanation:\n\n### Input : If I told you to take 40 apples out of the fridge but leave 60 apples, how many apples would be left in the fridge?\n\n### Demostration:\nWrite an answer that appropriately completes this request.\n\nInput: The question said that she should do this task in ascending order.

{"text": "### Analysis: The wording of the question is not straightforward and makes it difficult to isolate necessary information. One key clue about the answer choice is given in the table on the question page. \"When riding on an upland inclined slow, it [the buggy] travels at a speed [\u2026] slower than when it is on flat [sand].\" According to this clue, the uphill sloping segment of the overall trip on which the buggy travels will always be the segment on which it travels _slower_ than the flat sand segment. If this is indeed the case, then the sum of uphill and downhill segments will never exceed the sum of flat sand segments, meaning that if Connor rides the buggy 1/3 of the time on each segment that a 1/3 average speed will be derived (A). If the equation for average speed is \"average speed = [flat sand speed +( uphill slop speed \u00d7 rate of time when traveling on uphill slope)] + [downhill speed \u00d7 rate of time traveling on downhill slope],\" then this can be expressed as follows:\n```\naverage speed = 60 mph + 12*(2/3 + 1/3)mph - 18*(1/3 + 2/3) mph\n```\n\nIn order to isolate individual information:\n```\naveragespeed = (2/3 -1/3) *12 + (11/3) * 18 + 60\n```\n\n```\naverage speeed = 48-8 + 108 = 154mph\n```\n\n### Rationale: Above is a method I found for solving the above problem.\n\n### Analysis - Additional example: The problem: Given a problem of: \"You are given three numbers.

After every beaker was tested to see if it has cupper ions, it turns blue. It is then known that the beakers 13 has to be tested 52 times, which is 2 divided by 0.23. This means that 52 will be tested and that 2 will turn copper. I found this out using the copper ions and the 45 solution drops.

The given question states that class A has 40% of all students in this school, which means that 40% of students in total is 80 students. The question also states that there are 80 students in each class, so we can write: 40% of n = 80 students total = 80 class A students + 80 class B students + n class C students (because there is a possibility that the entire 80 students are not in a single class).\n\n2. We can cross out A = 80 since there are 80 in each class and C = n because there is a possibility that all 80 students aren't in a single class. This gives us that we only have to calculate B.\n\n3. The question states that class B has 29 students fewer than class A (B - A). This means that B - A = 109, so class B has 39 fewer students.\n\n4. The question also states B = 78, so B = 78 - 39 = 39.\n\n5. Because of this, B = 80% of X (because 40% of X is 80% of 89, which is 39).\n\n6.

{"text": "6.555\n\n### Rationale:  First, read the question carefully so that you are sure what it asks. Count the number of apples Pam has, which is 1200. Then, solve subproblems. The first subproblem is asking about the number of apples she has versus Gerald. Count the number of Gerald's apples per bag first, which is 40 for 1200 total apples. This would entail that Pam has as many apples in her bags as 3 Gerald bags.\n\n### Next, consider 3 Gerald bangs in terms of Pam's bags. Solve it as follows: How many apples are in each Gerald bags?  Count and 3 times that number. If Pam has 3 Gerald's bangs, which would be 3 times 40, then how many apples does Pam have from Gerald bags? Count that number and 3 times that. If Pam has 90 apples out of 3 Gerald' bottles, then count this as Pam's apples from Gerald. Then repeat it. Go in a series of 3 x as much Gerald bags, then Pam's bags, then Gerald's appls on a Gerald bags, until it comes to the last one.\n\n### In the last one, consider 6 Gerald bangs and Pam's bags which would be 6 times 90 as Pam has 12 bags in total.  Now the question is asking you to find the total number of 6 Gearld bags. Count how many times 40 is, which would be 240. Count how many Geralds there are in total. It is 240 times 6. If there are 3 bags, and then there are 3 times 4 times 6 bags in total, then Pam's apples would be 36. This means Pam would have 36 bags total.  Answer: Pam's bags 36\n\n### Input The math teacher asked students to write a number 3/4 as a product. Choices:  A. 35/4 B. 23/4\nC. 38/4 D. 22/4", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "After 90 days, 150 people remain, so there are now 150 people for the remaining 60 days. There are therefore 60/150 days = 4/5 of the supplies needed to feed that same remaining 150 people (each remaining person needs 1/5 of the supplies). This implies there should suffice to feed the remaining group for 4/(5\u00d74)/5 = 40/(5\u00d74) = 28/(5\u00d71) = 14/5 days after the 100 people left. After 50 days (assuming 10 remaining people), another 25 people leave, and there are now 25 people for the remaining 25 days. This is equivalent to 25/25 days = 1 day, implying the food remains to be sufficient for 60 days.

In ancient Rome, some people called themselves \"Roman citizens\". However, people in ancient Rome did not necessarily all agree on what it meant to be a democracy.\n\n### Task:\nWrite a response that properly addresses the request.\n\nSome ancient Romans believed that the Emperor could be removed from political office if he was no longer the head of the government, but by force.\n\nDoes this view of democracy make sense?\n\n### Demarcation:\nThe request states that some ancient Romans believed that removing a leader of a government was possible through force. Hence, the choice to keep the question is valid (not all political questions can be resolved solely in the ballot).\n\nThe choice A is invalid (democracy doesn't really make sense).\n\nThe choice B is invalid (some ancient Romans believed in force, not all leaders should be removed and democracy isn't based on force and has never used force to remove its leader).\n \n### Democracy:\nGovernment does not have to be ruled by force to qualify as a democracy. While ancient Greek and Roman government were certainly tyrannical, in a philosophical sense they can be qualified as political democracy.\n\nThe main point of democracy was government by the people of a land. In a literal interpretation of democracy, one can consider that the ancient Romans were not democrats as force was used on leaders. However, for the people the decision was made by democracy, not the leader. (https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured_documents/magna_carta/translations.html)\n\n### Final Judgement:\nThe choice C is valid (as force is not considered part of democracy).\n\nThe choice D is invalid (leader by force is not a valid definition of democrat).\n\nThe choice E is valid (democrat in ancient Roman society is not necessarily tyranny.

{"text": "The first thing to note is that it is important to eliminate irrelevant answer options, as some choices may only be in the problem to complicate the reasoning of the problem.  For example, it might seem like 6 is an option because it is the first weight of the puppy at 7 weeks old. However, the dog did not achieve its final adult weight by the time it was 6 months old, as this would lead to an absurd situation where the dog did not reach its final adult weight for two years. Therefore, 6 is an invalid choice and can be eliminated at the start.\n\n### The next step is to identify key information in the problem and to use your knowledge of mathematical relationships to deduce the answer using elimination.  For instance, we can see that the puppy's weight doubled by adding 12 pounds to its first weight at 7 weeks old: 6 + 12 = 18, and by adding 12 to the weight of the puppy every time doubles, the puppy's final weight should be 90.  This is because we know that the dog doubled in weight every time it was 7 weeks old.  It was 7 weeks old the first time, so it added 12, giving it 18; 18 is then doubled to give 36, and then a final 12 is added for an overall weight of 48 pounds.  As the next time is 15 weeks old and the weight doubles by another 12, we know that the dog will then weigh 60.  As the next checkpoint is at week 18, the 60 must then be doubled again, adding 12, to give 78.  By doubling again to give 156, we can deduce that the golden retriever's final adult weight is 156, as we can see by starting at 7 weeks and going through all the possible doubles of 18 and 36.\n\n### This technique is not the only one available to resolve problems of this type.  If we had more detailed information on the dog's weight, for instance, we would be able to see that it also did not double its weight in the time given.  However, we understand that the question is asking for the minimum final weight needed to obtain 15", "answer": " 78"}
{"text": "The answer to the question is **57.2** hours.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. We can answer the problem by first dividing each amount into 2.\n2. As shown in the image, we can separate each item on the right hand side so we can do the 2 step division.\n3. First, we see in the top box that Kenny's time runs for 10 hours for basketball. \n4. We divide this by 2 because, in the statement, Kenny played basketball for twice as long as the time he ran. \n\n5. On the bottom of the box, we see that Kenny ran for 5 hours.\n6. We divide this by by 2 because Kenny ran for twice as long that the time he played the trumpet.\n7. Now, we divide 10 by 2 and 5 by 2.\n8. 10/2 gives 5 and 5/2 gives 2 and a half. \n\n9.

If the sum of the digits is 0, then the number is 2 times greater than that number. If the sum is negative, the number is 3 times greater.

{"text": "Alyssa should collect at least 70 empty cans to make up for the difference of at least 67.\n\n### Response Rationales:\n1. Since A and B both needs to collect empty cans and 55, 67 (100 - 33) is the sum of both empty cans, A should collect at least 67 or more empty cans (at least 55) to make up the difference between 33 and 67. 67 - 55 = 12, which is almost equivalent to 10 (67). That means A only needs to collect 12 more empty cans to fill in the difference or make the sum of Alyssa's empty cans = 67.\n2. Given (67 - 50 = 17) we can write it mathematically as 70 - (67 - 33).

The first step in the answer was to move the decimal 45 and 5 to the left, bringing them in line with the tens place with the rest of the problem and the answer in the correct decimal place. Then, 45/5 had to be further simplified into 45 divided by 5, which is 9 in decimal form. In the last step 1 times 10 + 5 times 10 = 55. The remainder of 55 by 9 is 4, bringing the tenths place to 4. The answer is 4.0.\n\n### Rationales:(1) Decimals can be used to represent fractions within a number. The given problem asks for the tenths in 0.45. The easiest way to get the tenths place is to move the decimal 0.45 to the left by 1 so it ends up next to the tenths place with the rest of its place values. The first step is to move the decimal for 45/5 to the left since it is in the numerator place of the fraction. This can\u2019t be the same thing written on the denominator (5), even if it is in decimal, or it wouldn\u2019t be an accurate answer to the given question. (2) Then, divide 45 by 5 in order to find the tenths place in the fraction. This is 9 in decimal. (3) In the final step it is important to include all the places of the decimals to show that you have arrived at the answer.

Choose the value for each given variable (x or y) to come up with the corresponding variable given in the formula after each set of tests.\n\n### Input Sample:What is the value of y= 7x - 3 if x= 5?\n\n### Input Solution Sample: What's  (7x - 3) where x= 5? 7x - 7x = -3 and because we can't change the number of 7's 7x - 5 = -2. \n\n### Rationale:\nIn 7x - 6 = xy, 7 is a constant and x and y are variables. The value of 7 is 7 because 0 is not multiplied to xy and then subtracted. 7 is a constant, so whatever is multiplied by x and y will give the same result as long as the x and y values are the same.\n\n### Solution:\nx=5y=-2 because 7*5-2=64-2=62 and 5*7-3=-35 because (7*5-3)-(5*7)-64+2=-(-2-3+62+3)=(-35+62)-64.\n\n### Explanation:\nWe first start with x=5.

Similarly, one-eighth is half of 1/4.\nRounding up and simplifying the denominators, three eights is one-eighth, and one-eighth is 5/16.\nRationing through the choices:\n* One eighth is incorrect because it is part of the question.\n* Two eights is incorrect because 3 eights is one-quarter, so dividing it by two would be one-eighth.\n* Eight halves is incorrect as 'Eight halves' has more than one way to interpret this. The clothing store sells eight pairs of jeans, and each pair contains two shirts. This is different from selling eight pairs of jeans with each containing one shirt- this would result in eight pairs of jeans being sold. Thus, eight halves is not the correct answer since it contains more than one answer.\n* Twice as much is incorrect because selling an item for twice the original price would cause the store to lose customers, as they might not find a more profitable alternative somewhere else.\n\nTherefore, six of the seven answer choices are incorrect, and the only remaining response after applying the criteria is C: 2 eighths, or $100.\n\n### Input / Answer: The clothing store made $106.63 when the first 20 shirting and the first 10 pairs of denims were sold.

He has 10 minutes to get there\n\n2. Break the problem into smaller parts.\n\n3. Choose a base case and work backwords towards it. \n\t1. Marcolos is the person making the journey, which means he is the one setting the goal of how much land he needs to travel across before hitting his destination.\n\t2. For the base case, let's assume he is travelling at a very SLOW speed (to get to the lake slowly).\n\n4. Figure out how many tenths there are in a whole. \n\t1. If we assume a \"tenth of a mile\" means 5 feet, there would be 500 tenths in a mile: 500 tiles.\n\t2. Multiply the number of tenths by our base case speed: 500 times 1 miles per hour.\n  \n\n5. Identify what base case assumptions need to be updated to a higher speed in order for Marcos to achieve his goal of reaching work in 10 minutes? \n\t1. The lake is NOT an inaccurate distance. There is in fact only 1 mile between him and work.\n\n\t2. He can indeed travel 1 mile per hour.\n\n\t3. If Marcos travels at a speed of 2 mile per hour, it will take him 5 minutes to complete the journey. \n\t\n\t4. If Marcos travelled across the whole lake at the initial speed of 1 mile per hour, he would need 5 minutes to get there. However, with 5 minutes remaining to get to work, he needs to up his speed to 2 miles per hour to get to work within the limit of 10 minutes. \n\t\n\n6. Update the base case to reflect this new data and re-evaluate the solution.\n\t1. The base case now assumes a speed of 2 miles per hour.\n\t2. \n\t\n7.

With the hints he was 3 years older than Peter, so his birth year is 3 more than Peter and then subtract 1984 in order to get 1981. We also know that Julia was 2 years older than 3 years older than Wayne, so her birthday is in 1983. If we subtract 1983 from 1984 we get 1982. Since Wayne was 3 years older, we can infer that it was 3 years since 1982, therefore in 2021 it was 1985 or 1986. If Julia were born in 1986 then it would've been Wayne's birthday in 1987 rather than 1985. For example 1982 + 3 =? 1985 and 1983 + 3 =?  1986.\n\n### There were five boys who were in a math class.

And the base of the pyramid is 36 feet.\n\nStep 2: We will figure this out in two ways. First, by subtracting 5 feet from the height of slit which gives 31 feet. We are left with the base of pyramid which we know to be 36 feet. By subtracting 36 from 31 we get 5 feet.\n\t\nStep 3: The man is walking down the hallway at the base. We know that hallway can be considered equal to the base of the pyranid itself. Base = Height of slit minus 5 feet (step2)\n\t\nStep 4: Since we know that the width of the hallway is equal to the base of pyramd which we calculated to be 31 feet. To find the length of the hallway we need to divide 36 feet (base of pyramid) by 31 feet (width of the hallway) which gives us the length of hallway as 1.15 feet.\n\n### Output: The man is walking 1.15 miles down the hallway.\n\n### Rationales:\n1.

The implication here is that before being married, they still considered themselves to be a happy family, but that things have changed and they aren't anymore once they got married. This statement is not logical and doesn't make sense. As being \"no longer a happy family\" would imply that they used to be happy before, which contradicts the statement.

Calculation of Allyn's month bill:\nSolely on the equation above, it comes to be $120; However, this isn't a reasonable or correct response as it does not align with the calculations above.\n2. However, it is known that \"one-third of Allyn\u2019s light bulbs are left on\", which would result in a monthly expense of $100, which is, of course, incorrect.\n3. It could be also considered that 12 hours of power are consumed per watt to which the equation above could also be modified accordingly:\nSolely, $100 is the electricity bill of 120 watt-hours, but the actual consumption is $156 since 2wht are left on after turning the light off for 24 hours. However, 56 minutes are left in the month, which would be $120/156, which is incorrect.\n\n### Analysis:\nInput:Allyn pays $25.20 per month in electric bills while having 40 lightbulbs in total. If Allyn consumes 700 watt-h (W), how many lightbulbs must be turned off in order to cut expenses by at least 80%?\nRationales: Allyn\u2019s total monthly electric bills are $25.2 per month.

We see that Aisha has 500 songs in her mp3 player, and as she realizes her mp3 has large playing capacity, she adds the new 500 songs. Later, Aisha realizes the mp3 has large capacity. She adds extra 500, and then she keeps adding and keeping track. However, she realizes she doesn't need all the songs, so she removes 50 songs. We can write the original question as: **Aisha has `500` songs on her mp3, and she adds `500` more. After a while, she realizes that her mp3 has a large capacity. Aisha adds `2*500` more because the mp3 has the large capacity. She likes everything except `50`, and she deletes those songs.** Let's think about how the value of `500 + 2*500 + 450 + 25+ 50` changes when we calculate the new and old values.

{"text": "The statement \"If Lucy would give Linds $5, Lucy would then have the same amount of as Linds\" can be interpreted as such: If Lucy did not give Linds $5 (Linds was indifferent to getting $5), Lucy would have no more or less than Linds (i.e. the amount Lucy originally had, which we'll call $X, and the amount Linds had, which we'l assume is also $X). If Lucy gave $5, Linds has $5 more than Lucy, so Lucy's amount is $X-5, and Linds has $X+5. Since Lucy has the same amount as Linds, we know $X-5 = X+5, which means Lucy's amount is zero. Since this wasn't possible without Lucy actually giving Linds $5, we know Linds received $5. So from the statement \"If Lucy would have given Linds $5, She would then have the same of as Linds\", we can infer that Linds gained $5, meaning Lucy originally had $X-5, which can be simplified to X-10, and Linds originally had $X-10, leaving Lucy's amount as $X, which can be simplified as $X-10.

{"text": "This problem asks how many skips on average did Jeff complete per round. Choice G: 7 times.\n\nRationales:\n1. To solve the question, first we must know about what Sam and Jeff had competed in, which is how many skips they completed per round. It mentions four rounds and each round had a different number of skips. Second, which are Sam and Jeff. Sam completed 1more round than Jeff in the first skipping competition. Third, we need to know that Jeff had been skipping 1 more round than Sam in the first competition (this also tells us that Jeff must have been skipping for a shorter period of time than Sam). Also, Jeff would have skipped twice as many times than Sam did in the second round. Next, it tells us that Jeff must had competed 1 round more than Sam in the first skipping contest. In the first skipping competition, Sam would have completed the first round one time more than Jeff and each competitor would have skipped 1 round. When we subtract one number of rounds from the first round, which is 2, Jeff would have skipped 3 fewer rounds than Sam. Lastly, it tells us that Sam and Jeff competed for 16 rounds, but Jeff would only completed half of the number of rounds that Sam completed. This tells us how many rounds were completed by Jeff, which is 8 rounds, and Sam would have done the rest of 8 rounds. So, if Sam skied 16 rounds in each round, then Jeff would have skied 7 rounds in each round. So, when they both skied for the same number of rounds, Sam would have had one round more than Jeff. But, it says each round was completed by 16 rounds. So, to get the average number of rounds per round completed, we must first subtract 16 from 16 which is 25. Next, we must do division over that number. 25 is half of 50. So, half 50 will be 50/2, which is 18 18 1\u20442. That is where you get 8 times as many rounds completed.

{"text": "2 hours and 40 minutes\n\n### Reasoning: 1. Use substitution to eliminate. To get the correct choice, you are just multiplying the two answers from the people and then adding it to the remaining time left if the people had worked together. Ex) 12 hours to 8 hours: 12 hours \u2013 8 hours = 4 hours.\n2. Remember your subtraction formula to solve for the missing variable when it is given to you. For me, since the question is subtract, it was (5600 / 2.25) - (3600 / 3) = 1500/3 = 500\n3. To solve this one I just plugged the information given into the formula we learned before. Use the 6000 = 6. So to multiply with 750 you multiply the 6 with 750 to make 4200. Then you can subtract the 2000 from 4200 to get your answer.\n4. This can be rearranged to 56*6 = 6*56 = 324 = 200 + 124\n5. You will know that it is C if it is 50% or less with a remainder for example 75%. The 80% of the time (2.25) was 2.25 \u2013 2.25 = 0 = 0%. It means that only 20% (5.5) people have 2.25 blocks every one hour while all the rest have 2.0333 blocks every hour.\n6.

The difference between what she has on hand when she uses 1/4 and just before she uses the 1/4 is 3650/25 - 216 = 343.5'.

The moon is a planet. How is the moon similar to and different from the earth? Choices:  True: A False: B True: C False: D False: E\nRationales:1. From the provided fact list, the relationship between a planet and a plant can be identified as a planet can be distinguished from a plant by being a star, which is not a plant (option A is the same concept as true and false but different statement). \n\n2. The moon, a planet, is similar to the earth in the sense that it is a rocky body that is orbiting the sun. However, they differ in the fact that the moon is made up of rocky material. \n3. Hence, the appropriate response is option C: The moon is similar to the earth both in that the are both made of rock and both orbit the sun but different in the fact that the earth is made mostly of metals whereas the moon is made up entirely of rock.\n\nAnswer: C: The moon is like the earth in that they are both rocky bodies orbiting the sun but different in that the earth is made of mostly metals whereas the moon has a rock composition.\n\n### Input:\"Sun\" is a planet. The sun is to the moon as an apple is to the table. Choices:  A  B True C False D False E True\n\nRationales: From question one, it can be concluded that the moon is a planet to the sun. If the sun is a planet, then to a planet is the same as an apple. So, the relationship between an apple and a table is that the table supports the apple. Hence, the relationship between a sun and a moon is that the sun orbits the moon so, it is a planet to the moon in the same way the table is to an apple. This means, that the closest statement to the truth is option C (a sun/apple relationship is that both are supported by a table. A moon/sun relationship is that the sun is a planet to the Moon and that the table supports the relationship)\nAnswer: The closest statement to the truth in the given statements is: option C:", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Answer: The tree apples are at least 2 feet high, but 20% less, so the tree apples are at worst, 1.6 feet tall.\n\nThe average shoulder height is 29 inches. If the apples are at least two feet high, and at most 6(1.6) feet from their head, then you can't reach apples that are any higher than the first step above your head.\n\nYou have to subtract 20%, the average height of Larry's head, which would be a step below the top point, and then reach downwards to grab an apple.\n\nYou have two people: one who is 5 feet tall who can only reach an apple that's as high as their shoulder line, and the other is 6(1.5) feet, so you can't reach up or down more than 2 feet and you have to reach down at the top of your step, or the closest to the surface point.\n(6x1.5)=10-2=8\n\nYou can only reach an apple at a point where the highest point of your head meets the ground.\n8x10=80 - 2=80 - 8 = 72\n\nSo, apples as high as 72 feet upwards are reachable by the stack. \n\n### Question:\n\nWhich choice correctly completes the sentence?\n\n1.

The store manager has sold out.\n\n### Rationale 1:\n\nSold all the inventory is the correct response, because all items at the store are now out of stock.\n\nThe store has much more inventory than what he is selling. So this makes no sense. Store Manager has sold all out... we need reorder....\n\n### Rational 2:\n\nSold out is an idiom and means that some inventory is sold.

Therefore, the errors would be in the verses rather than the chorus. Furthermore, the chorus is a song's catchy part, with the verse being the more complicated structure, with longer lyrics and more complicated rhythm and melody.\n\n### Answer 1: Chorus.\nThe chorus is a song\u2019s repeated part, that is most likely to be listened to by the listener in a short span of time and with better concentration. The lyrics aren\u2019t as complex as in the verses (the part having more errors) and, therefore, is listened to more often.\n\n### Errors are most probable to be introduced in an important part of the song.\n\n* The verse, as defined above, includes most of the parts in a song (if not all of the song). Thus, if there was an error in the majority of the song, it would be in the verse.\n\n### This is because an error in a part of the song, if a song has one, would likely be caught.

The problem asks which of the given options is the closest solution to the question. The problem asks about a porch that had two amounts of dust: a total amount of dust particles of 331 prior to Samuel's sweeping and 9/10 of this amount swept by Samuel, amounting to 302.\n\nAfter Samuel walks over the porch, he left 223 of the 302 dust particles behind, amounting to 150%. Therefore, 302 - 150 = 152 dust particles remain on the porch, amounting to 0.49 of the original total. By subtracting this from 331, we are left with 331 - 152 = 179 dust particles remaining on the porch, which is 0.52 of the original total.\n\nSubtracting this from 554, we are left with a total of 554 - 179 = 375 dust particles on the porch.", "answer": " 1080"}

To reach the correct number, the student needs to first add the 10% tax to the original amount, then add that to 10% tax of the correct amount of time worked (30 days) to the original amount (40 daily).\nRationales: There are two parts to calculating tax. The first part of the tax (10%) is an amount that's added directly to the amount that the employee earns. The second part of the tax (the 10% for working 30 days) is an amount that is calculated specifically only for how long the employee has been working for.

Let's use whole number math and the multiplication table.\nWe can see the product of 6 and 3 is 18. So 18 is the largest factor of 6 that will divide into 39. So we can see the lowest price the small tubs can be, for these reasons:\n\n1. The smallest number 6 can go into is 6, as the larger factors will leave a remainder (18 will not factor in).\n2. So all factors must be less than or equal to 6. If the lowest price was 7, Alison would have to pay 7*6 = 42, which is over the limit.\n3. So the lowest price for the tubs that cost $6 is 6.\n\nSince Alison spent a total of $48, she has $160 left. If she split the expense evenly, she would spend $80 on the three large tubs and $80 on the six small tubs. 80/8 = 10.

{"text": "We can find Martin has invited a total of 6 + 10 + (5 * 2) + (5 * 10) + 5 - (5 + 10) = 6*5 - 15, people to the party. We can further find that Martin's friends represent a total of 9/15ths of the people.\n\n### Rationale:\nGiven the instructions: Martin is organizing a party... How many people can potentially attend the party? We already have the information we need to answer this question: the overall number of invited participants, the number of people from Martin's hometown, and the number of people from his school.\n\nWe can begin by counting the number of people from the two given groups. There are 5 people from Martin's home town and 10 from his school. We still need to add the two other groups to determine how many invitations remain, but for the moment, we just subtract the 15 people who already attended, or 15 people left, to determine how many are still left unattended. We can now ask the question: 15 people from Martin'shometown attended, and 10 from school attended. How many people from his sportsclub attended? To do this, we're looking for the number of people who attended that represented the number of people from each of the other groups that were invited. By process of eliminiation, we can say that it is a total of 15 people (10 from his school+ 5 from his hometown) to account for a person attending from each of both groups. We are therefore left with 20% more people: 20% of 15 = 0.3 * 15 = 4.5.\n\nNext, we can ask the question: How many overall people are invited? It tells us that a total of 2*(5 + 10 + 5) *2 = 240 people are invited. This makes for a total invitation of 240. So, now we have all the information we need to find the answer: there were 9/15 of the people who attended; so 15/12 of the people who are invited will attend. 9/15 = 15 over 12, or, 15/", "answer": " 36"}

{"text": "Roger went on his bicycle for a total of 8 miles.\n\n### Input & Initial Thoughts\nRoger rode his bicycle for 8 miles in total during the night\n\n### Response Code (Step by Step)\n1.  Start off by identifying the key words in the question, which are  morning and evening.\n2.  Firstly, we can see that from the words morning and evening, we know the direction of Roger's riding of the bicycle. (morning = day time / evening = night time )\n3.  Therefore, we can conclude that he rides his bicycle from 6:00 AM to 11:59 PM and from 12:00 AM to around 5:59 AM.\n4.  Next, we can identify the distance Roger rides in each of these 15 periods (15 hours in total).\n  (6:00 AM <--> 11:57 AM / 12:01 AM <--> 5:59 PM )\n  (12:00 PM <--> 4:59 PM)\n5.

The question states that the crew consisted of 14 sailors in total.\n2. The 14 sailors are divided into two groups based on their experience. One group consists of five sailors while the other set consists of 9 experienced sailors.\n3. We know that each experienced sailor is paid 1/5 of times more than the incurred labor of the inexperiences sailors.\n4. With the above, it can be calculated that the 5 inexperiences pay $200 total, and the 9 experienced payments combine to be $1350.\n5. Hence, the total combined monthly payments comes to $1550.\n\n#### Rationale:\n\nFirst, the question states the crew consisting of 17 sailor.\nThis is a total of 14 sailor because 17-5=12, but we only have 14 sailors.\n\nTherefore, there are 14 sailor in total, 5 experienced and 9 inexperienced.\n\nNext, we are told that the inexperiencement sailors are paid $10 per hours for 60-hour weeks.\n\nThus, the five inexperiencements earnings are $10x60=600, and the nine experienced sailors have earnings of $10x64=640\n\nSo, total earning=640+600=1240\n\nHowever, it is also mentioned that sailors are paid for work over the whole week.\n\nTherefore 640+640=1280 is also the earning.\n\nSo, let $1550=1246+50.", "answer": " 34560"}

This indicates that there are 3 sets of lace for each team.\n\t2. 3 sets of lacing will not be enough for all the teams since each individual can't have the same pair of skates at the same time.\n\t3. Since each person needs 2 pairs of skates, there are 3 sets for each pair or total of 18 sets for each team.\n\n\t4. Because there are 4 teams, the total number of sets needed is 4 sets of skates multiplied by 18, which equals to 72 sets.\n\n\t5.

We can eliminate (D) because a teacher's emotions are unaffected by the competition of others.\n3.

There were 16 bottles and 110 passengers and the flight was headed to destination A where Maddy's 4 th grade class needs to make a total of 1000 valentine's day cards in order to get a pizza p[arty.\n2. Now we move to the next step where we start to eliminate the improper answers. Because when dealing with the question a total of 31 books were lost because of the accidental fire at library. So, the minimum of the number of books that were fiction was 31 because you need to be over 27 books to be considered a fiction book; that is because a total of 40 were young adult and 25 were fantasy books. Hence, the first improper answer to exclude would be E: nonfiction because that's a lot of non-fiction books. If you're losing an entire 31 books of fiction out of a 36 that we can presume that number is much higher because of the fact that a non-fiction book is so long. It's very likely that the total number of books lost was 40 because they lost 35; so, that's possible but the minimum value that we can get is 27. So, the answer we can eliminate first is D: Mistery books because they don't have a minimum of 27 books and if you eliminate the first", "answer": " 760"}

When I came here and saw the plastic problem of China was still here, I realized a lot of people just don't know what to do, so I want to give my advice to them, let's hope it can help them.\n\nFirst I think people should get to get used to using bags. When some people think that paper bags are more environmental friendly than plastic bags, I would like to tell them to have a second thought. Plastic bags can be reused over and over again and there's a bigger chance for plastic bags to be recycled. The main reason why plastic bags are more environmentally friendly to environment is because plastic bags are easier to be recycled, while the paper bag is more likely to get thrown a away after a single use.\n\nI think that using cups are unnecessary, too. Using mugs or anything else reusable are much better than using cups. Everyone can take these cups with themselves when they go to the tea/coffee shop, so we can save plastic, paper and energy. When there are plenty people have their own mugs, it also can decrease the amount of trashes we need to take care of.\n\n\nI've realized that it can be much more difficult to carry trashes when we are going out for the outside, but it's necessary.

So, we can draw the venn diagram and find the relationship between the number of stixs the boys brought and the number of stix the girls brought.\n![Example](output.png)\nThe next thing needed to work on the problem is the formula for finding the total amount of stixs brought by each group.\n![Example](calculations.png)\n\nThe denominator of the fraction indicates the number of boys there are in the whole class.\n\nSo, when one looks at the denominator, the boys and girls are divided in equal parts that can be found by subtracting the boys' denominator by the denominator of the girls in order to get to the correct answer of the problem.\nThe total number of popsicles sticks for the whole class will be 240.\n\n### Follow up instructions on the topic of this problem:\nChoose another math problem where the teacher wants to know if the student can find the total number of a certain kind of items with certain attributes.

Not true at first look - the choice gives the amount of time used for grading, but not which percentage it is out of a given time frame. However, this reasoning can be removed by understanding that the statement to be true is that every 1/6 is used to grade tests, which would mean that given 90 minutes of class time, 15 minutes can be given to grade. Since 15/6, or 15/3 is 5, the statement still checks out.\nC. Not true at first glance - this gives us an amount of time that is used to grade, but not which percentage of total time it is out of. However, we can understand that the claim is that every 16 minutes, which is 1/6 time, is used to grade. As such, \"1/6\" of the total time should be given to grading tests. We also note that the answer can be expressed as \"1/6\" = 5/6.\n\n## Test Answers (Output):\nThe class time being 5/6 = 2.08, then the amount of time grading is 1/2.08 = 0.0478125, so D is your answer.", "answer": " 3"}

The total amount of money I spend should be $75.\n\n### Explanation: In the question there are three CDs displayed for sale in the shop, with each CD selling for a specific price, as the shopkeeper would list the price of each CD they sell.\n\n### If you assume you bought 3 of every CD and the question is about what you'll have to pay after buying 3 of each, the answer would be $185. 5 CDs * $100 (The cost of Life Journey) = $500, 5 CDs *$50(The cost of A Day a Life) = $250 and 5 CDs * 85(The cost of When You Rescind) = $425 totaling up to 455 which is in the ballpark of 185, therefore the 185 is the incorrect answer.\n\n### This is how you can arrive at the answer of $75.\nInput: What's the total amount money I spent in the music shop? Choices: \n1. A: $185 \n2. B: $75 \n3. C: $210 \n\nRationales:\n1. If you bought 3 of each (A Day a Life) = 3*100 =300\n2. If you bought 4 of Life Journey = 4*100=400\n3. If you bought 5 of When You Rescined = 5*85=425\n4. The question is $100+$50+$210+$400+$425, which you should add up and subtract the 300 to get the total you need to pay to the shopkeeper. The final calculation would be 100+50+210+400+425-300=75\nAnswer: 75", "answer": " 705"}

{"text": "Choice:\n\n### Demodration:\n\n1. The question asks James when he can start lifting heavy again.\n\n2. He wants to wait 3 days after he first hurts himself from lifting heavy again. There is not a third day between the initial 3 days because the 5-day minimum for the injury would only be a factor if he had been lifting heavy the day he hurt himself.\n\n3. The question then asks how long it takes to fully heal, and the answer is 5 times the minimum amount. That is equivalent to 25 days. This is after the first 3-day waiting period.\n\n4. Then, the question asks how long to wait after he fully healed, before starting to lift heavy again. The answer to this is obviously 2 times 3, since he was asked twice about the number of days he needs to wait. He is asked about this factor because the exercise he started after the 5-day healing period might be slightly more vigorous than his previous workouts, and he wants to give his body time to adjust.\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. When you are only told that something hurts, the pain subsided after 2 hours, but he did not say that he waited 2 days. The pain subsided is more than likely the time spent waiting and relaxing. So, he did not wait for the 2 days for the second part of the question.\n2. James is only asked about 3 total days of waiting so he is only waiting for the actual \"healing\" stage of the injury.\n3. The three days after the injury subsides is not counted in the equation for when he starts lifting again.", "answer": " 39"}

{"text": "The total number of strawberry is 168\n\n### Demostration:\nLooking at the first portion of the problem, we eliminate Option A based off of the number of times Kimberly has more strawberries than her brother.\nWe get: Kimberly has 8 times the amount her brother has. (45+45+50+8+93+93)\nHowever, going though this chain of logic means that the total number of stawberries does not need to be listed as a possible option.\nFor Option B, if their parents picked -93 strawberies less than her, then the total number of stowberry would be (45+40+50+8).\nSince 4x5 is 20, and the sum of 20 and 93 is 113, adding the 2 totals should give an answer that is 93 less, resulting in 21 and not 45 for the total number of stawsberry. Since this also could not be the case, this too can be eliminated.\nNext we look at option c. The logic here follows, the addition of the total 45+45 is 90. Since 3 times 3 is 9, 2 of the option would not be possible (45, 90).\nThe only remaining option is E (168). Going through the chain of logic in a way that makes sense, we find that Kimberly would have picked 169 since 8 times 2 is 16.\nSince 93 is not the result of the second group of summations (-93), we can say that Kimberly would end up with (16 + 2)+20+45+40 +90, which is 168.\nWe can eliminate any of the incorrect options and arrive at the correct answer of 168.", "answer": " 168"}

{"text": "To solve this problem, start by applying the triangle rule. It's a commonly taught rule that all three sides of a triangle are equal to a third of the base and height of the triangle. However, the application of the rule will depend on the nature of the base and height.\nThe base is given as 'the side of the square paper'. Since the side of a square has equal length and width, the base could be identified by the length of one of the square edges. In other words, the base could be the edge of the paper. To find the height, this can be identified as the length of remaining perimeter, which is the difference in length of the perimeter of the square piece of paper and that of the screen. That is, if the perimeter of the screen is 5cm (L1), and the perimeter of the paper is 20cm (L2), then the height of the screen is equal to 15cm minus one length of the square paper (L2).\n\nL1 + L2=5cm, \n\\- L2=5cm-L2,\n\\-L2+L2=5cm,\n\\-L4=L2,\n\\--8=L4,\n\\-L3=L4,\n\n\\-L3-1L3=15cm,\n\\ 2 L3=15cm+1,\n\\ 2L3=16cm,\n\nL3=\\ 8cm\n\nL1: 5cm\n\n\\\nL2=20cm\n\nL3-1L+1=\n\\ L3-\\ 20cm-\\ 8cm+1=\n\\  L3-28cm+1=1cm\n\nTherefore, the height of the screen will be approximately 1cm.\n```python\n#Perimeter L1=20cm\n# Side L2=4\n\nx=L1+L2\n\nL2=x-L1\n\nn=x-20+20-28+1\n(2L2)=n-(2L1)\n\nL2=L2+(2L1/x)\n\nL3=x*0.25-(x/20)/8\n```", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "The charcoal grill ran for 60/15=4 whole hours to finish the process of burning down the three bags of coales.\n\n### Rationale:\n\nRational: I. First part:\n1. Given a total number of coal burning time: 15*(60) coals. \n2. Second part:\nTo find the timespan for burning 60 bags of coal to ash: 180 bags of coal. So we can infer that 180=60 or multiply both sides equal to 1.8x the number of coke bags.\n3. And therefore: 15*1.8=27 total times of burning. \n4. To find the timespan of burn for a bag of coal: 180/27=7 (rounded to nearest whole number). Since we multiply first the second part to the first part. To get the exact total burning time, we multiply both sides by the product of the first part and second part. Result: 1930=7(15*60) total time span for burning down 180 bogs.\n5. Thus, 3 bags of coales have 21 coales each, so the total number of coals it burned (15*(21)-coals per bag of coales is 865. To get that timespan, 27/865=3 whole hours and 20 mins.\n\nAnswer: It took 3 hours and 20 minutes to burn down 15 bags of coales which will total to 180 baked of coales. That's 180 total bags of coales, of which 3 (7 total bags) is 21 (15*60 coales per bag of coales). So the time span was 3 whole hours and 30 mins.\n### Rational Part: II.

I chose this example as an introduction to the model above because it demonstrates what questions would have a one-step solution and what would not, it is also a good example of two possible ways to arrive at the same correct answer.\n\n**If I were asked a question with these same answers and question format while doing this challenge, I would attempt to multiply by 0.5 and come up with 17, but if my teacher told me to use 0.8 I would have  converted the 0.5 to 0.8 but I will note, that if I did not notice my teacher's error, and I was not in an area where there was a calculator readily available, I would have probably had no way of knowing the correct answer.", "answer": " 81"}

Since he catches enough fish, he can give them equally to the three of them. For each fish he catches, he will give each of them one. If Oomyapeck will eat 22 eyes, then Ittymangnards will eat 22 - 2 * 2 * 2 = 17 eyes.  Kingnook will eat 18 eyes,  and Ittymangnard will eat 17 and his dog will eat the two remaining eyes.\n\n### Response Rationale: We do not know whether or not Ittymangnars catches enough fish for his family for a day. If he didn't catch enough fish, then he would have to catch more in order to feed his family for a day instead of having enough for a day. He gives 22 eyes to Oomyapeck because he has enough fish to give him. As a result, Ittymangnarc eats 22 - 4 = 18, while Kingnook eats 22, and his dog eats two.\n\n### Input\n>How old is Ittymangnak?

Consider the 13.8%, and it becomes apparent that food is by far his top priority. Therefore, $1000*30/100 = $300 is spent on food each semester, which leaves $700 for other expenses (entertainment and other). $700/16.7 = $41.85 is therefore spent on entertainment, which leaves $367.15 to spend on coursework materials. $367.20/$30 = $12.25 dollars per month/semester.\n\nAnswer: $12.23\n\n### Input:: What percentage of 200 is 59?\n\n### Rational:\n59 is out of 200.

{"text": "Since each question asked is about how many digits of pi was memorized, the best solution to be is to set an array of the 2 players, with the first position set to one since the first question was about Sam. Then, we can do a loop from 1 to n and determine the next number for the players by subtracting each players values.\n\nFor example, since Mina has the first position, we start with Sam at 1. Then when comparing Sam to Carlos, the loop runs from 2 to 6, to determine how many digits of pi Sam has memorized. Similarly, after we figure out how many digits Sam has, we can move to the next position, which is Mina. So, as long as it has a value not determined yet, we need to move to the next position. When the array has a value of -1, that means it's done.\n\nFor each question, we get the results of (0 if none, otherwise the sum of the two other numbers) * the index of the player in the position.\n\nRationales:\nThe first question is all that is required to be answered to solve the rest. In the first question, the array has Carlos as the first variable. Since Carlos can be negative integers, if it is a positive number, we subtract from it. If he is a negative number, we need to minus 1.\nIf Mina is the first, she is always a positive number. So, we simply minus 1 from her. Once we do that, we move to the next position and subtract the other player. Since we haven't answered that question in the index we move to, we'll use the previous result. In case the position is the same, which means they switched positions, we need to subtract 1.\nFor example:\n```\n0. Since carlos is 1. So we subtract 1\n0. Since Mina is 1.

For example, John could not help Dave and the Bill could not help John and only 20 men could help the others.  Hence, the remaining men would be able to help the other men of similar grade. \nAfter each helper helps each man, there are still 30 men in each group who all have the same grade and have the remaining 20 men in their group. \nEach grade man has a unique name and 30 men with the same name in each group would mean that the first group had a total of 60 men and second group.\nAnswer: 0.64\n\n### Input - 4 girls who had similar names and 3 boys who had similar", "answer": " 5"}

So, you can't tell how fast Leo was able to do the second part, and you can't figure out how much to deduce.

That would be $4 per hour, or $8 per week.\nNext, we have half work time for second job which means that it takes 15 hours per week for him to make $8.\nNext, multiplying hourly rate of his main job multiplied by number of hours in a week which comes to $540.\nThen, adding the earnings from second job to the previous amount earning comes to $548, which is still close to the target amount of $540.

{"text": "Because we have ratios:  10:45, the first thing to remember is that we can multiply them to get 2:15. Then notice that there are two types of coins, Elsa has 10, and Amalia has 45, so multiply 2 by 10 and then by a quarter, and that we'll get 10 \u00f7 4 (or, two quarters). 50 is what Amalie has, and that means there are more coins in Elsa's pile. If Elsa has 40, and Amelie has ten, then Amelie has five coins left. However, this does not take into account the fact that Amalie spent three-quarters of her initial supply on toys, so now that Amalie has ten dollars, there are ten items with a ten dollar price tag, which means that, if she goes to the shop and buys one, she'll still have ninety dollars in total. However, there are eight items in all, so it would be more prudent to assume that Amalie still has ten dollars for each toy. So, after multiplying ten by five, we get fifty dollars, and that she would have ninety dollars in her wallet. Now, with fifteen more, there would be a total value of one hundred dollars. The remaining ten coins are enough to cover the cost of the three toys she has in her wallet, leaving eleven, which means she's got six coins remaining after purchasing the other two, she's got one coin, so she's got seven coins, so she's having two.\n\n### Input (Different): The ratio of Elsa to Amalie's coins is 10:0.5.

{"text": "470\n\n### Rationale:\nFirst, we will eliminate two answers that are obviously wrong. In this step, we do not provide explanations because our goal is to eliminate one answer at a time.\n1. The answer choices of the number of photos they took in the entire trip (one day and two days) were 150 and 230. The sum of these numbers is 380. Obviously, the total number of photos cannot be 470.\n2. Adding the two numbers (230+120+150) does not form the total number of photos nor does it help us.\n\nOnce both answer choices were eliminated, we were left with three possible answer choices: 510, 520, and 470. Now, we need to calculate each answer choice.\n\n#### Answer-510\nThe first day's photos were one half of 400. The second day's photos were 120 more than the day before.\nTo verify our calculation is correct, we'll start with our first day. So we have to know how many we'd made, and we know that that was half of 401. So we are looking for 200.\nLet's work through this. Half of 400 is 200. Take 200 and 120 and do each problem separately. \n\n200+120=320. After taking 120, we now have 200. So take 200 and add 200, so we have 400.\nFinally, add 400 and our original number, 320, which is equal to 720. This means we had 470 photos.\n\n\n\n### Input-\nThe numbers in the first bracket are for the first number in the sequence, the numbers in the second bracket are for the second, and so on.\n\n### Output:\n\n525\n\n### Input\nI will input the answer to the next problem, you input the input. \n\n### Rationales:\nAfter solving the first sequence, we look through the choices and eliminate possibilities of answers that are impossible according to the rules of the sequence", "answer": " 920"}

There are 4 fruits in the image. We can say the juice in the image is fruit juice as they all form part of the same juice. There is one peach, two orange (both sliced) and one apple (whole).\n\n### The only thing we can do is say that there's more than 1 peach in the image. We need to find the fraction in which a peach represents.\n\n### Answer: We need to find the % of fruit juices which are peach. By dividing the number of peach juices with the total number of juicy fruit in the image, we can get the fraction.\n\n### Solution: Since there are only 1 peach in our image, all other fruit don't count into the fraction. So, the fraction of a peach juice is: 1/4.", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "20 miles\n\n\nInput: If the Earth stopped spinning today, which animal would start losing its hair first? Choices: A: Squid B: Hamster C: Tiger D: Whale E: Rhino\nRationales: For a Squid: Although a squid does not have any fur to shed, if it were to suddenly stop moving, then the pressure on its internal organs would cause it to start losing its own ink inside of it, this is because the squids ink sac is connected to its intestine and if the squid stops moving its internal organs would begin to expand.\nFor the Hamster: Hamsters have two coats of fur. One inner, warm coat, and one outer, cooler coat. If the Earth stopped spin, the hamster's inside coat would start to warm up and dry out, but the outer coat would not have the same cooling effect and therefore the inner coat would burn in this circumstance.\nFor the Tiger: Tigers have a layer of fur, but they are also born with hair on their heads, legs, and paws, so if the Earth stopped they would also start to lose their hair.\nFor the Whale: Like the squid, a whale's skin would lose the protection due to sudden stops and no forward motion.\n\nInput: How many squares in the rectangle below have the length 5 cm?

The shadow at 12:01 is zero.\n\n### Rationales: 1) A. At noon, the shadows are 5 feet long. One hour later, that 5 feet grew to 5+5=10. So, the shadows are at least 10+10=20 feet long at 2:00. 2) B. At noon, shadows are the same as the ones at 6:01. So, shadows are 20 feet long. C. At noon, there are no shadows. 6:01 and the day shadows are the same, but there is no shadow, because no shadows were at noon. 3) C. At 6:00, the longest shadows are at 6:05 and 6:10. So, at 8:00  the longest shadows are 12:05 and 12:10. And since these shadows are longer, the shadows at 8:05 and 8:10 are longer again. So they are twice as long as 6:05/6:10. 4) D.

{"text": "The restaurant earns $2,400 at the end of the month.\n\n### Input : How do you tell the time to 60 minutes?\n\n### Demostration:\n1. Read the question and identify what it is asking. The question asks you to tell the time to 1 hour and 20 minutes i.e. 60 minutes, not just 60 minutes.\n2. Identify the time given for the current time, in this case 11:30 am\n3. From here, figure out what the question means: How do you tell the hour to 60 minutes (adding 12 to that)? This is simple as 11:33 pm is 63 mins after an hour, which means its hour is 1. \n4. To work out the minutes, you would need to count the total to 60 minutes instead of 1 by multiplying 60 by 1 i.e. 1 x 60. This is then followed by the addition of the total of the minutes together with the 3 from the given pm in this case.\n5. This would make the new time 63 + 3 = 66 minutes, giving the hour to be 6 and 66 minutes in total.\n6.

{"text": "There is an average of 11.63 carnations in the set of bouquets.\n\n### Response explanation:We need first to find the mean of the set to solve the question as per question mark. The first includes 9 carnations and the second includes 14 carnation. For the first bouquet, the number of carnations (9) represents 9/14 (0.643) of the total, so the average number of car-nations in the bouquet can be calculated as ([9/14](0.643)+9) / (9+14) = 1.66. This is the number for the first bouquet. For the second bouquet, the number (14) represents 14/14 (1), so the average number of flowers in the bouquet is (1.66+14) / (1+14) =.5. The third can therefore be calculated as the average of one carnation more than the other two, so.\n\n### Input 2: Aaron had 23 carnations in his bouquet, which was 3 carnation less than 2 times as many carnations as in his friend's bouquet.

After all, math is all about numbers and relationships. It involves using facts and rules to solve a problem. A simple way to deal with this issue is to take a step back and try to understand what is happening with the problem. What is the solution telling us?

The company doesn't have a lot of capital and each model would require $40,000 to make, but they each might yield $6,000 in profit.\nThe first car model, the small luxury car, would cost $40,080, which is 80% of the base selling price of $50,000. If sold at this selling price the first model will earn $560,000 in revenue with total expenses of $44,080, leaving the model with a profit of $115,920. With a 40% profit margin the profit from sales of the small luxury car would be $46,448.\nThe second car model, the medium size sedan, is a bit simpler to calculate but still needs some assumptions. The cost is $42,000 and could be sold at $61,000 with total expenses of 42,00 +4080 = $46,080.

Thus, the `towelsWsahDuration` = 2(30m) = 60m(60 minutes wash for one piles of laundry, i.e., towels ) = 60m.\n\nThen, \"Sheets take 15 minutes\" or \"how much laundry is inside sheets\" which is 15m.

{"text": "Input: The letter L represents 25 people in the team. The letter N represents 13 new people getting in and let's call them L13. The letter R represents 8 people quitting, and the letter C represents 13 people getting in. Hence, the new equation for people is the sum of the letters for each letter. N13 + R8 + C13 = L25 - L13. However, since no new people came inside the team (N=0), we can rewrite this as N13 + 8 - C13 = L13 - L25. Substituting 8 for -C13, we get N13 + 13 - 13 = L1 - L25. Finally, we know that 8 is less than 13, so N=1, L - L25 - 1. Therefore, in order for the team to have fewer people (less than L25, which is 25 in total) they need to subtract 1. Hence, the team needs 1 fewer person, which brings the total to equal to 24.

(This can be seen as the student adding P because P13 (P+N-R) was close to the teacher's question)\nHence, we can set N=1 in our equations to get P-P13 = L - L25 which can be simplified to give just P = L - L26\n\nSince P=L-L25, if we subtract P by 1, the expression becomes L25 - L26, which just gives the answer P=24.\n\nWhen asked for the answer A, which is 24, the answer was in order.", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "The response should begin by describing the layers of rock mentioned in the question. According to the information given, there are 25 different types of rocks making up the strata. \nRationale: The first place we look at is the layered sequence of rocks. Each layer is made up of a different type of rock. For example, limestone comprises 5/25ths (or one-fifth) of all the layers. Hence, one rock layer (or layer element) is made up of limestone. Similarly, sandstone comprises 25%. So every sandstone layer is made up of 25% of this rock, which means that half of the remaining layers aren't sandstone but some other rock type, such as quartz or shale.\nGiven the information given for each rock type, the rock that makes the fewest layers is the rock type that makes up a single layer. If we sum up the percentage for each rock, the total percentage does not exceed 100%. Consequently, the rest of the rock percentage is 0%, which implies that there are other rocks not previously mentioned that also make up layers.\nBased on this information, there are at least four rock types that make up only one layer, i.e. one-fifth of each layer.\nAnswer: D", "answer": " 3"}

However, the answer to the question is the digit 4, so the position of digit 4 should be considered as well.\n\nSince there are 5 digits in the given problem, if we arrange them in a sequence of 5, so that there is no repetition of any digit.

{"text": "2.40\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The first step here should be to set up some variables. Doing this can simplify the problem and make it easier to work through. Here, we can define X to be the number of potatoes, and Y to be the number of containers of salt.\n2. The next step for this problem is to evaluate the ingredient variable X first. Since X is equal to the number of potatoes and is calculated by dividing the number of potatoes made with each batch, which is 2, with the number of batches, which is 30, we know the following must be true: X = 150/30, and we can set that value as X.\n3. Since X has been determined, we can now focus on the variable Y. In order to calculate the number of containers of the salt needed, we have to evaluate the value of the salt container, which is $2. After that, we'll substitute the value of X into the salt container formula first, which is Y=200+X*5. The first part, which is 200, can be calculated by multiplying the second part by 100. We are therefore looking for X*105. The second part of the formula can simply be calculated using addition with X and 5, which is 155. Therefore, since X=150, Y=205.\nIf Susan calculates a total cost of $84, we know that she made 205 batches of potatoe with 30 guests attending, and 155 batches of salt with no leftover when her purchase reached the dollar amount of $84. We know that one batch of salt makes two containers, and each container of salt costs $5 in salt.\nThis means Susan had $205 in potatoes and $84 in salt.\nAnswer: $200 + $105/2\n\n### Input:\"Blair\" is a computer program that uses over 2% of one's computer's memory.

{"text": "Ideally, you would like to think about whether 1 or 2 tanks do the job. If you had one tank, the balloons would be filled and you would have no need for two tanks.  It almost seems unlikely that 1 tank would be sufficient to fill all 1000 of the balloons, so 1 tank does not seem like the best choice. However, if you look at that same tank and ask how much air it contains, you would see that this tank contains 500 liters. This means that one tank can be used to fill 500 balloons each.  Therefore, if you have one tank, it can fill 500 litres of balloons each. If you buy one 500-iter tank, it is unlikely that you can fill it fully. Therefore, you should buy two tanks.  I recommend buying two 500-litre tanks.  This is because you'd like to be prepared in case you find that one tank can't fill all of the balloons and would need to fill the remaining ones with the next tank.

This tells us that they each have the same amount of pencils.\n3. Additionally, the question states that Asaf is 5o and Alexander is 60 more. This gives us the information that their respective ages make a difference of 2o. We need to use this information and the relationship between age and quantity of pencils to solve.\n4.  Finally, we solve: 60/2=30 30=50% So Alexander has 3 times as many as Asaf.

{"text": "Answer:\n\n### Description:\nInput: This week, the fishmomenter sold 50KG of salmon. He then had a week later, where there are 3 times the previous week.\nHe must have sold that much to reach the total of 2 weeks. Since it is stated that he is selling that much fish (kg), we may have to assume that the fish is not rotating in that fish monger.\n\nEven though we were asked to not consider rotating in our assumptions, I think it may be important to consider it as there isn't a specified timeframe in the problem.\n\nWe may also assume that there is no rotating in fish monger considering there is no other indication or information that he is rotating it.\n\n### Input :\n\n* This week, the fish monger sold 5Kg of salmon.\n* A week later, he had three times more.\n\nAnswer:\n* I think that the amount of fish the monger sold was 400Kg.\n* We can break it down as follows :\n    * First Week : 5Kg of Salmon Sold.\n    * Second Week : (3*5Kg) = 15Kg Sold.\n    * Third Week : (3*15Kg) =3 more times the first week = 45Kg.\n\n### Explanation:\nFirst, we need to take into account that the fish is a kg of salmon (Kg Salmon). We can not assume that the 5Kg of saltman is fish (fish) as we do not have a rule to support it.\n\nWe can not only assume that it was 5Kg of fish, as we do not know if salmon was rotating in the fish market.\n\nEven if it is assumed that the fishmonger rotated the 50Kg of salmon, we still have to take into account, that the first week was not 50Kg as we are not being told a 50Kg Salmon is sold.\n\nWe may assume that it was not 50 kg of fish, as we have no way of knowing that from the question.\n\nSince the question does not provide any details regarding how many kg of salmon is in the market", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": "Let's take each section the way they are labeled in the question and use proportions to solve for each section. For the fruit section, fruits take up (1/2 * 1/4) or 1/8 of the total fruit section, so we'll subtract (1/8 of 64 sq ft) from 64 to get square ft of the fruit section remaining. The vegetable section is 64 sq ft - (1/2 of the remainder of the fruit section) = 64 - (1/8 of the fruit section) - (1/4 of the fruit section) + (1/2 of 64 sqft) to be done with that step. So, we subtracted the total fruit section minus the strawberry quarter and then multiplied by half to get the amount we will add to the vegetable section.\nNow, we know we need to add (1/2 * (64 - (1 / 8 of the fruit section))) to the vegetable section as well as we have two parts left that need attention; multiply 16 by 1/2 (64 - (5/16 of the fruit section)) to be done with that problem and add that onto the vegetable section also. Next subtract (1/2 * strawberry quarters), that is 32 sq ft, from 64 and multiply by 1/2 again, which is 8 sq ft, to be done with this step. Finally square footage is found by multiplying the remaining vegetable section size (64-32 from the strawberries) by 1/2 to be done with this.\nThe answer for this is 164 sq. ft\n\n### Response Explanation:\nLet's start with the easiest problem first: the fruit section. After multiplying each group by 1/2, we get the following:\n```\n 1/2 * (fruit section)\n1/2 * 32           (1st step)\n1/2 64 - 5/16          (2nd step, multiply 5/16 by 1 to convert from its fraction to a decimal)\n```\n\nAs the second step requires a little more explanation, we'll show how to get the fruit portion of the section after subtracting\nthe other two.\n```", "answer": " 8"}

The problem states that a building has 17 floors and an elevator is on the ninth floor. It then adds that the elevator goes down seven floors, then up three floors, and finally, up eight floors. The building must have eight floors below the ninth floor. One floor is taken away by the elevator going down seven floors. Then three floors are added back on the elevator going up, resulting in two floors. The remaining two floors are added from the elevator going up eight floors. Adding together the floors that were taken away and the floors added on, the elevator goes down 7 floored and up 8 floors, totaling 15 floors. The building has nine floors plus an extra floor because the elevator is on a different floor than the top floor, resulting in 16 floors and 75% of the building above ground, leaving the number of floors to be rounded up to 17.\n\n### Alternate explanations\n\n### Explanation: The building has an equal number of floors on each side: 8 above and 8 below.\n\nFrom this we can determine the floor that the elevator is on because it is on the 9 th floor above.\n\nIt is also known that the elevator goes up 8 floors then it goes down 7 flooring below the elevator.\n\nBy the two facts we now know the floors above and below the elevator and the floors it travels on.\n\nWe are now trying to figure out how many floors, or how many 8's, we have to travel.\n\nAfter travelling up by 8 we go down by 7 then up by 8.\n\nThis is 15 floors altogether.\n\nBut since this isn't an even value floor it must be rounded up to the next floor.\n\nSo the number of floors will be 16 or", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "ANSWER: Betty needs $21 more money to buy a new wallet.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The problem starts by stating that Betty is saving money for a wallet. However, this is vague information without a given monetary value and doesn't show what specifically Betty is saving for.\n2. This is where the given information becomes crucial. The problem begins by stating that Betty \"has half of the money she need [sic]\" which implies that Betty already has $50 available for her wallet.\n3. This further shows that the given money is the $50 Betty already has aside from the $15 she received from her parents and the twice given amount from two unknown sources.\n4. But what about the $50 she already has and is now working on with the given money? Because it was stated she had \"only half of the money she [Betty] needs\", this means her remaining half is $100, which is enough to cover the total wallet price.\n5. With this information, Betty needs $21 (the $15 she received plus the $15 from her parents twice with the $100 Betty already had) of additional money to get the total needed to buy her wallet.\n6. Hence, this is the correct answer, as Betty needs $21 extra money to complete her expenses.\n7. It would have been more explicit if the question asked how many times Betty needs to be given an additional $15 (1*15 + 1*15 + Betty has $50 already aside), and to simply add it together.

D) No\nE) Yes- but it is not directly related to the main question.\nF)- No, but it'd be a helpful tool\nInput and Demo: The given information is that Carolyn practice the piano for 25 minutes/day and violin for 75 minutes/day. The 25 minutes/piano divided three times for Violin means 75/3 is 25. So Carolyn's practice in a 2 weekly basis is 3 times as much/day. Which means her practice in a week is not twice. The 1345 is her hours of practice in a month.\nExplanation: I am using the hour to minute calculator in my Google play store to calculate this\n\n### Input\n\nCarolyn practices 20 min. a day and the violen 3 times as long. If shes practices six days a week how many minutes does she practice in a month with four week?\n\n### Demo\n\nInput and Demo: For every 4 weeks of Carolyn practice, she practices 75 min. in a day that is 1 week practice (1 day is 1 week practice x 7=49).\nExplanation: Here, I assume Carolyn practice 3 times longer than piano that is 1 time longer in a day. So we will divide 1350 by 3 that make Carolyn practice 450 times longer than her piano practice in a month. That is equal to 450*4=1800 more minutes of practice Carolyn do in one month.\n\n### Input/demonstration:\n\nAnswer:\nB. The answer is 1350 because that is the number of minutes Carolyn practices in a month for 4 weeks. \nThe problem statement doesn't include the answer.

The question asks why it is important to \u201cwear safety gear\u201d when playing sports.\n2. Safety gear refers to clothing and equipment that can protect an athlete from injury.\n3. Exclusionary methods can be used to eliminate the unhelpful choices. For example, wearing safety gear does not necessarily mean \u201cavoiding injury\u201d since injuries can happen even with safety gear.\n4. Additionally, clothing is unlikely to serve the purpose of \u201cmaintaining balance,\u201d which is likely to be related to physical skills, rather than clothing.\n5. Similarly, \u201cprotect equipment\u201d is an unlikely reason as sports equipment will most likely be replaced or repaired after use during a game.\n6. Thus, the only remaining answer choices that remain are: 1. To avoid injury, 2. To stay alert, and, 3. To stay clean.\n7. The best answer to the question is C: To stay clean because the other two choices all imply protecting something, which makes no sense in the context of \u201cgear\u201d being worn in sports.\n\nAnswer: C: To stay clean\n\n### Instraction", "answer": " 50"}

First, look for the number that is equal to the average amount of money that the 15 yo makes in one week\n2. The easiest number to compare is 1500 since it is not mentioned nor listed\n3. From there you know the average amount is 1501. If B is correct 1,391 * 5 = 7,535 then 7,536 is equal to 1.501\n4.

It follows from the wording of the question that Ariella has $688.976 (the amount is important for the purpose of calculating the total from Ariella's interest, but the amount has only to be greater than the $491, not greater than the $480 so that she gains from Daniella's withdrawal). Then Ariella's interest is $89.85 for the year, so $89.86 * 2 = $179.72. Her total is $688.19 + $179.8 = $867.99 after interest. Which is greater, Ariella's or Daniella's? $867.1 + $491.51 = $1358.61 > $681.04 = Daniella's total, so Ariella has significantly more.

This is a ratio problem, so we will find the number of values to multiple 12 by (the numerator, 73) to get to 1500 (the denominator).\n2. A number needs to be multiplied by 12 73 times, so 12 needs to be factored into 73 73 times.\n3. If we divide 73 by 12 to find how many 12's fit into 73, we get 63. \n4. 12 x 63 gives us 736; so we multiply 63 by 12 as many times as it takes to get 1500. \n5.

{"text": "First, the question states, \"When Katherine is two dozen (24) years old, how old is Mel?\". This means the year in which Katherine and Mel are going to be 24 years old, and not the current age. \n\n### Rationale:There is a sentence that shows that Mel has to be the younger of the two. The sentence reads \u201cMel is three years, younger than Katherine\u201d. Therefore, Mel has to be the one three years younger. \n\nNext, there is also a question stating, \u201cHow old will be Mel in years?\u201d. This further verifies that Katherine and Mel are not yet of age and are both younger than 24 years old. Because the question refers to the age, both Katherine and Mel are younger than 24.\n\nUsing the provided information: Katherine is 24 when Mel turns 24.  Also, Mel is the one three years younger, 24 must be divided by three to get six. So, to be 24 when Mel is six years old, Katherine must be 20 because 24 when divided by 3 = 8.

If we assume that Mark bought one item for $4.2 and another item for $2.0, (which is the equivalent of buying the item for $4.10 and some change), it means that Mark bought 1 loaf of bread and 1 cheese. \n3. If we assume that he bought 5 loaves of bread, that is he bought more by paying the cashier $21 for the 5 loaves, then the cashier will give him $0.65 in change since he paid $7 and only takes back $7.35. \n4. If we assume that He paid $25 and took back change of $24.95, then he will get $0.35 in change. \n5. The only choices that can get the correct number of change to mark will be the ones that take into account the fact that Mark only gave the cashier $5.85. \n6. 1 quarter and 2 dimes is equivalent to $0.725.

{"text": "Detailed Solutions:  Given there were 18 students in the minibus for a fieldtrip, and 8 of them were boys. The total number of students was 26. In class, there were 14 girls. So, in the minibus there were 12 more girls, which mean 26 divided by 18 (18 minibus students) - 1 (14 school students) was 5. The difference between this equation and 14 and 8 is 6. This means of of the 18 students, 6 of them were not able to attend the field trip due to personal reasons.\n\n### Input 2: There was a bus with 33 passengers, 62% of which were adults. The number of adults on this bus is greater than 17. Find the number of adults on the bus.\n\n### Solution:\nDetailed Solution: First, we start with the total number of passengers - 33. We then find the percentage of adults (62%). This gives us 62. We can then say that for every 100 passengers, 62 were adults. Finally, we have to find the number of adults greater than 17 since the number of passengers was 33. We know there are 62 adults, so we start by multiplying every 33 by 62 to get 2016. We can then subtract adults of 17 and get 2015, which means adults greater than 33 were 17.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe above exercise is useful for getting a handle on the types of questions you might face during different maths sections and also to prepare yourself for the GMAT. The main takeaway from this is to identify key information that is important. Remember that you are likely to get some maths questions with a more open ended nature like the one above, for which you will likely need to rely on critical thinking and reading as much as on the mathematics involved. \n- https://www.practicumglobal.net/how-to-solve-gmat-problem-solving-math-questions/", "answer": " 2"}

Girls got two eggs each, so each got 2 less eggs than the adults had, (total of eggs given is 6 eggs).\n* 2 x 2 = 4; (2 x 3) - 2 = 2\n\nBoys were given 1 egg more than the girls were given. So, boys got four eggs, while girls got two:\n* 4 eggs x 1 boy; (4 x 1)\n* 2 egg x 6 girls; (2 x 6)\n\nThe question indicates that the number of girls is 7 and:\n* 6 girls, the younger girls, got 2 eggs each and:\n\nGirls = 6;\nEggs given to Girls = 2 x 6 = 12;\n\nYounger Girl's Egg Distribution = 7 (7 Girls x 2 Eggs each)\n\n* Two boys, older boys, got 4 eggs each:\nBoys = 2;\nBoys were given an extra egg each, as stated in the problem:\nBoys were given one extra egg each. Boys = 2; \nEggs given = 4 x 2 = 8;\n\nOlder Boy's Egg Distribution + 1 Extra Egg = 8 (8 Boys x 4 Eggs each) = 12 Eggs\n\nThe total number of eggs received for the trip = (12 + 12) = 24\n\nThe family had to have 24 eggs left for home because the adults received 3 eggs each. The eggs received by the adults = 3 x 2 = 6 and because 24 - 6 = 18, the family had 18 eggs left for home.\n\nThe question is asking how many boys went on the family trip:\n\nThe number of eggs received by girls = 6\nThe number of eggs each boys got = 8\n\nTherefore, the number of boys", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Input: The problem description includes an objective problem that describes two different situations, a square foot requirement situation for one present and a situation that talks about combining three present numbers. \n\n### Solution:\nThe problem is solved by summing up the total amount of wrapping paper needed to cover all the presents. \n\nThe problem can be approached by looking at the two different situations to find a suitable solution for both. There are total of three presents. It's then determined that each square foot requirement can be solved independently. \n\nBased on the first square foot requirement, we need to find two square feet of wrapping to cover one present. This means combining 2 and 1 to get 3 square feet. \n\nThe second square foot requirement means covering three-quarters of square foot amount that one present requires. We then add 2 with 3/4 to get 4.25 square feet. \nThis means we now have 7.25 square feet of wrapping paper for the first two presents. \n\nNow that we have 7.24 square feet of wrapping paper, we can repeat this process for the third present. 7.25 +0.75 = 8.00 square feet. \nSumming up the requirement for the third present (8 square feet) with the total requirement of wrapping present with 2 square feet (7.25), we have 9.25 square feet needed to cover all the three presents. \n\nHence, the solution to the problem is nine and a half square feet. \nAnswer: F: 9.25\n\n\n### Input : \n\n### Demosntration :\n\n### Soluqtion\n\n### Solution\n\n### Solution in Excel\n\n### Solution using Regular Expression\n\n### Solution Answer\n\n### Solution with Excel macro", "answer": " 7"}

Choices:  Age 5, Age 10, Age 16, Age 19, Age 20, Age 22\nRationales:\n1. A 'fairly obvious' way to solve this problem is to simplify each term, for instance. For example: 10/4= 2.5. 2 times 2.5 = 5. 5 + 4 = 9. If the number in parentheses is less than one, that means 2x + 4 < 1. Hence, the number in parenthesis is 5.\n2. If we simplify the second term, it's just 4, so the number in the parenthesis is 2.\n3. For the third term, simplify it to 10. The number in parenthesis in this case is 12.\n4. The fourth term simplifies to 11. 11 + 14 = 25. The number in parenthetical is 14.\n5. The final term simplify to 2. 2 + 6 = 8. The number in parentetic equals 6.\n6.

{"text": "A: Oscars plan is (2n+6n) which means he should start 6 weeks before the marathon.\n\n### Detailed explanation:\n1. This prompt has two variables (number of miles to run before the marathon) $n$ and (number of training weeks, or number of days before the marathon) is $x$. This is a typical programming interview question.\n2. The logic for this question is to calculate the difference between the number of weeks the candidate will take to run 20 miles with their current speed, and the number of weeks if they were to get a 2/3 mile per week increase. This means that if the number of weeks before the marathon is $x$, the number of weeks between 20 miles and 2 miles is $20-2$.\n3. We know that, if $x=5$, the answer is 13 weeks because $x\\cdot\\frac{2}{3}=\\frac{5x}{3}$ which is the number of weeks between those points.\n4. Substituting $x=5$ into the equation, we get $5\\cdot \\frac{3}{2}=\\frac{5\\cdot 2}{3}$. We subtract 2 from $5$ and get 3.\n5. We know that $5\\cdot \\dfrac{3}{2}=\\dfrac{5\\cdot 12}{6}$ because we are dividing the first number's total by the second number's total. To get the answer, $12/6$ gives us $2$. We need to subtract those two numbers because we have already subtracted 2 from $5$. This gives us the following: $5\\cdot \\cdot \\frac{39}{69}=\\frac{5\\times 6}{13}$.\n6. Now $6/39=-0.15$. We need to square the negative because we are subtracting $5\\times 6/12$. So $-0.15^2=-0.2625$.\n7. Now that we have $0.2626-$2, let's divide and conquer. $2/69-0.262/.69=0.0667$.\n8. When we divide both sides by 0.69, we get $0.0666", "answer": " 27"}

{"text": "It would be possible to respond to this task by using the formula [3 * sqrt(50% of 120)]. However, there are some better strategies. First, simplify the situation using an assumption and draw a picture to visualize the problem. The assumption we use is $120 million x 3.5 = $430 million, that is, the total earned box office tickets. Also, for simplicity, we can assume that the theaters take the $350 million in box office profits.\n\n### Input:[3 * sqrt(25% of $12000000)] = [3 * sqrt($300000)].\n\n### Input2:If you earn $5 on Monday, $4 on Tuesday, $7 on Wednesday, $9 on Thursday, and $3 on Friday, what will you make on Saturday?\n\n### Input3:What is 100 squared?\n\n### Demolition:First, solve the problem using the original mathematical formula.\n- [3 * sqrt (25%*$12000,000)] = Squaring both sides of the equation\n= [3 * sqrt ($30,000,0) * sqrt (100)]\n= [3 * 30000 * sqrt(100)]\n\n- Multiplying both sides of the equation by 20,000\n= [3 * (100 * (100])\n= [3 *10,000]\n\n### But there's a more efficient way of solving this problem. With the assumption, we can see that $430 - $350 is $80 million in profit. We can also find the percentage of profit that goes to the production company after the theaters are done, which is 60%. So, in our case, we will assume the production company got back 60% of the profit.\nWe can therefore conclude the number of tickets sold for the entire run is\n>$430 x 0.6 = $258 million,\nand the production company got back about $160 million.\n\n### Response2:Adding 1 to either", "answer": " 192000000"}

Therefore, by subtracting 2 from 20, we will find Claire's age at the present time. \nTherefore, by adding Claire's two-year-time age to the age of six, we will find her age at the present time of 26. \nThird, by subtracting Claire's age when she will be 20 in two years from the age of five years, we will find Jesscia's age at present.

So 1.5 cupes * 5 puppies = 110 cups of food each day the puppies need to eat.   Joy must buy 101.5 cups dog food for 6 days, making a total of 608.5 cupe of dogs food.  But Joy has 7 days. 101.6 - 7= 94.6 cupes of dog food she has to buy for the mom of dog and the puppies. For dog food buy 94.6 + 89.5 = 556 cupe.  And for the pupies 94.6 * 5 = 1017 cupe.

Sarah ate 8 cups altogether from brunch on Sunday to dinner Thursday, including two cups from brunch, four from lunch, three from dinner, one from breakfast, and one from snacks. To fulfill the goal, Sarah has to eat 0.5 cups of dark, leafy vegetables a day and five cups of vegetables not on a total basis.\n\n### Rationale: The issue is identifying how many cups of vegetables daily do Sarah need in order to fulfill her daily minimum requirement. The Federal Guidelines suggest eating \"at least 2 cups\" of vegetables per day, or \"at least 1 cup\" of dark leafy vegetables per day. Sarah ate 0.5 cuppers of dark leaf vegetables per day and 5 cups of vegetables, excluding dark leafy vegetables. Sarah was able to fulfill the requirement because she ate 5 cups of non-leafy vegetables, making up 2 to 1.5 cups of leafy vegetables each day. Her full daily minimum requirement is 6 cups, and she reached it.\n\n### Output: Sarah has already eaten 8 cupers of vegetables overall, including 2 cupers of dark leafy vegetabels and 5 cupers of vegetables.

He then decides to give half of the remaining to his friend(8candy) but ends up with fourteen remaining. What should he feed his friends to even out for him?\n\nInput:Amy and Billy were in a relationship. One of the first rules is they do not want to tell their parents. The next day, Amy went to work which was away from town and Billy went to college to study. How do their parents reacted that day and at the end of the week? Choices: 1: A: Parents find out that kids are dating B: Parents find out from friend C: Parents find out on Facebook D: Parents don't care until the end of the week\nRationales:1. Amy lives somewhere else which would not be far away as long as her parents drive there to look for her in the first place and see them together. 2. As Amy is in another town, Billy has to drive to pick her up or meet her instead of having her meet him. This proves Amy and Billy's parents are aware of her living away and they drive there to check up on her. 3. In week 2, Billy is still studying for his finals but he told Amy they will be able to meet soon. And in that night, he asks a friend to snoop into Amy's account to check if Amy's posting in Facebook. So, Billy wants to keep a secret from his parents. Then the next day Billy's mom asks where he is planning to bring his girlfriend but he quickly denies. 4. On the last day/week of this week, Billy gives Amy a ring and they run off to get married on the weekend. So Billy doesn't even need to go to college to study when he can be with his girlfriend. 5. Thus, he can return the ring to his parents and tell them that he has gone back to college and that Amy is not his girlfriend anymore.\n\nAnswer: A: Parents Find out that their kids are dating\n\nInput: You're in line, a person says \"the line is too long\" another person says \"The line is too long!\" How would you react", "answer": " 19"}

So, Jackson has at least $5 times the amount of money Williams has. Therefore, $25 is incorrect because it's less than 5 times $25.\n2. $30 is less than $5 times $60 and is less than 5 times the amount of $25. This makes it incorrect since we have already concluded $25 is a wrong answer.\n3. $35 is the value when $5 times $70 is 4 times the amount of $5 times $25 (or $50), making it incorrect.\n4. $40 would be incorrect since it is more than 5 times $40.\n5. $50 is incorrect since $5 times $100 is $250, which is more.\n6. $60 is incorrect because, though it is not more than $50, it is less than $25, which is already ruled out, according to the premise.\n7. $70 is ruled ineligible because $5 times $75 would fall below the minimum amount of $5 times the $25.\n8. $80 is incorrect since 50 plus 100 would be a value of more than $50.\n\n9.

{"text": "The teacher wants you to find an answer between 0 and 8 that will add up to 50 because this adds up to 25% of 80%\nSo, we look at the question. The question is asking students, \"How many apples did Chang's Garden give him?\"\nNow that we know what the question is asking, let's move on to the first statement. \"He can sell the sweet ones\" What does this mean? We need more information. Chang's Garden gets apples from trees. He needs to sell each of them to a customer for $.5. This leaves $.4 to cover the cost of the apple, and $.1 to cover the cost of each apple sold. This tells us the 5-0-5 because he needs to find a value for each apple and multiply it by 3.\nHowever, we cannot go more than three apples because two 50-cent apples equals $1 or 100-cents.\nNow we come to the second statement, Chang can sell Sweet Apples for $.5 each. This means each apple, in total, is $.5, not on the apple. That is, if Chang has 1 apple, he can sell it for 60 cents, not $1.\nSo, here is the information we need. Each apple costs $.6, and Chang gets three apples on average, so this tells us to do something for X= 1.25(3)= 4.5 total apples.\nThe last question is \"If he earns $4, how many apples will Chang have?\" We can see that if Chang earns $4, it needs to equal 40. Because Chang knows how many 50-cent apps he has, he can sell them as many customers as he pleases.\nNow, Chang has 45 apples and knows he can get at least 50 cents on each apple. We can get $40 by making each apple $.666 each, or 667 cents.\nNow let's write this in order:\n\n![](/assets/readme-assets/math101/14/18/img_0264.png)", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "Input: Identify the objective of the question, and then determine an approach to answering it.\n 1 The question specifically mentions how 'three different jobs' and 'a plumber' have only 'three toilets and three showers' at three different 'apartment complexes'. This suggests the plumer is trying to 'earn the most money' for these three jobs. \n2 To do this, we must calculate the monetary sum that will give him the highest amount of money. \n 3 To understand how to do this, we must analyze all three options in terms of price and quantities involved. \n 4 The first option has 3 toilets and three other things which are not explicitly mentioned in the set of options. These could be showers or sinks. \n 5 Although it is not explicitly stated in the question, the price to fix a shower is the same as for a sink ($40). This means:\n6 The plumber must spend $120 to fix the first job. \n7 The second job contains 2 toilets and 5 things that might be showers or sink ($50 for one toilet, $40 to two showers, and $20 for 3 sinks).

{"text": "> B: 6 cats and 10 cows\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The above answer choice is the only one that satisfies all of the conditions listed in the problem.\n2. The number of sheep drowned must equal at least the number of sheep.\n3. Since the number of cows drowned must at least equal the number of sheep, the number of cows must not be more than the number of sheep. Because 10 sheep drowned, there are 9 cows left.\n4. Although the number of sheep equals the number of cows, the total number of cows could be up to 14.\n5. The number of dogs must be at least 12, since they exceed the minimum of 6 sheep.\n6. Although there were 5 dogs left on the life raft, there were 14 cows that also got to shore alive and were saved. It wasn\u2019t mentioned how many dogs died during this accident, but since there were fewer than 14 dogs dying, the number of dogs that died can equal the number of cows that died and we still have 3 spare dogs remaining.\n7. Since the total number of animals surviving is 20 sheep, and 10 cats, we can further eliminate the other answer choices. 25 dogs and 5 horses cannot be the answer because they would exceed the total number of animals on the boat.\n8. The total number of animals that are left alive, including dogs, is either 20, 10 or 6. There could be a possible match because each of these could equate to 14 cows. 9. The answer choice of 6 cats and more cows cannot be the answer because the number of cows surviving is at most 10, while there are at least 14 cows remaining. This leaves the final answer as 6 cats and at least 6 cows which satisfies the conditions listed above.\n\n### Inputs:\n\n### Response 9/1:\n\n### Rationales:\n\n**Rationale 1:**The solution is 8a (A-C) + 4d.\n\n**Rationale2:** The solution is 2b (A,B,C) + 4e (D-F) + 8", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "The correct answer is 4\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: There are six more white birds adjacent to a compartment than gray shades in the compartment. If the number of gray shades in the container is 40, after 10 minutes, 1/2 of the birds in the compartment are unleashed and fly away, calculate all the birds staying after.\nAssumptions: The question assumes:\n1. There are more white birds than grey birds next to the compartment.\n2. All birds in the cage were either white or grey.\n3. There were at least 40 total birds in the cage, all of which were either grey or white.\n4. After 10 minutes, half of the cage's birds were freed and flew away.\n5. The grey birds that flew away were not included in the 40 grey birds in the casket.\n\nDeductions:  In other words, there were 6 more white birds than grey shades in the compartments. If the number of dark shades in the compart was 40, and 50 percent of the birds in the cradle were free after 10 minutes.\nWe have that the amount of total birds staying after is determined by how many birds are in the cage and how many other birds fly away.\n\nWe can eliminate 3 choices.\n\nExplanation of choice 1: Since the birds that flew away weren't counted, we know that the 40 grey shades represent all 40 grey birds. Thus, 20 of the grey shades were unleashed, causing 20 grey birds to be freed away and not included in the question.\n\nExplanations for choies 2 and 3: Choices 2 and 3 provide answers of fewer than 40 birds remaining. Since the 40 grey fish weren't mentioned to exclude them from being in the calculation, we can rule out the possibility that there are 40 less white shades compared to the grey birds. This would be because there should be no grey shades in the cage if all the birds flying away are accounted for.\n\nThus, the answer is 4.\n\nNote: the author doesn't provide any logic behind their answer.

{"text": "Three women\n\n### Rationales:\nThe question states that three women bought an amount of apples that is 20 less than each man.  Since three men bought 30 appels each and the three women bought 20 less appels than each man, there would have been an initial amount of (30 - X) appels each woman bought, where X would be the total appels each man initially bought. If we let the number of appels each man bought be m, then X = 30 - m. Therefore, the total number of appels each woman bought would have been (30 - m) - 20. We want to find the (30 - m)-20 in this sum. \nRearranging the terms and adding the two terms together, we get (10 - m) + ((30 - m)- 20) = 10. Thus, 10 is a factor of 30 - m which implies  (30 - m - 10) + (20) = 20. Hence, 30 - m = 5. Since each man bought 30 appeles each, m = 6. Therefore, (6 - 20) + (2) = 3 which implies 3 is a factor of ((6 - 20)) + 2, which therefore means 30 is a factor of (( 6 - 20)+2). But we know that 30 is the amount each man bought, and 6 - 2 - 20 = 3. Therefore, there are (20 - 3)+ 3 = 17 women in the store.\n\n\n### Input:\"The book contains no pages\" what does it mean?\n\n### Demensionation:\nA book can only have two dimensions because no objects can be infinite dimensional.\n\n### Input :\" The book that was found, had no pages.\" What does it mean?\n### Demension:\nA paper has two dimensions(length and width).\n\n### Input \"All books have both dimension\" what is true?\n### Demesnation:\nIf something contains a property \"a\" it also contains the property \"b\".\n### Example:\n1.

How long is the regular trip?\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales: The car made the trip 3 time longer than it normally does. First, convert hours and minutes to seconds. We know the regular trip took (1/4) of the time it took with bumps, 1.25 times. We also know that the trip is 4 times longer. Therefore, we can rephrase this, since it took 1.25x regular time to complete the trip that would normally last 4x this trip, the trip normally times (1/1.25). Therefore, the normal trip times 4. \nTherefore, the regular trip is 4 times as long as the normal trip and since we know the regular trip is (0.25)*4 times longer than the normal trip, we can say the regular trip is 1 times 4 = 4 times as long, or 4 times 1, or 4 times the regular trip which is 4 times the normal trip and 4 times 4 times 4 \nI wrote down the answers at the beginning and did not need additional steps.\n\n### Input 1\n\n### Response 1\n\n## The next few problems can be demonstrated via mathematical processes.\n\n### The teacher asked for the class to complete the following assignment\n\nThe next class's assignment was to complete a paragraph demonstrating how the three examples in the previous class's assignment (the ones with four or five letters) can be combined to create a five-letter word, and that the five-letter word must also follow the vowel pattern (a-e-i-o-u) and include all seven letters.\n\n### This was the solution\n\nThe teacher asked the class to come up three examples of how the five-letter words can be combined to create the five-letter word.

{"text": "The female worker ants are 50.\n\n### Reasoning:The male ants are represented as part of the worker ants. Thus, you have a 20% chance of getting a male worker ant. Since there are a total of 110, there are 22 of these male ants out of which 20 are worker ants. Thus you have 22 * 20 / 250 outcomes. \n\nSo, this is a binomial distribution that can be solved by using the equation (22 * 22)% / 250. If you simplify this equation, you get 15/250 which is.15.

Dean ate half...\" this implies that Dean ate (six pieces, or) 24 slices of pizza. \n\nWhen we read, \"Frank only ate 3...slices of Hawaiian pizzas...\" this implies that after Dean's 24 slices, Frank had eaten 3 slices of the Hawaiian pizzas.\n\nWhen we read \"Sammy ate a third...of the cheese\" this implies that after dean's 24slices and Frank's 3 slices, Sammy only ate 6 slices of cheese pizza (1 cheese slice in each of the 3 cheese pizzas)\n\nWhen we read the last sentence, \"How many total slices were leftover?\" we can infer that there should be slices left over after taking in Sammy's 6 slices.\n\nPutting the information together:\n\n|Slices Sammy Eat |Slices Sammy left |Slices Frank Eat |Slices Frank left |Slices Dean Eat |Slices Dean left | Total |\n|:------------:|:-------------:|:------------:|-----------------:|:---------------:|:------------: |:-----------:|\n| 6 | 6 | 21 | 6 | 36  | 36 | 28 |\n\n### Example:\nThis is similar to the last section, except the numbers are different.

{"text": "### Answer the following math problem that is based on homework given to students for school.\n### Lydia has a small swimming pool she uses to bathes her dogs. When full, the pool is able to contain 60 gallons (226.8L) of water. She bathes her dogs twice a month and fills the pool using the garden hoses, which provides water at a rate of $1.6 gallons/minute$ (4.5L/min). Unfortunately, the pool has small holes that leaks out water at $0.1 gallons/minute (0.0375L/min$. How long will it take the pool to be filled?\n### To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the rate of inflow and the rate of outflow. So, the pool is filled when the inflow rate is equal to or greater than the outflow rate at which point the pool reaches its target volume $60 gallons$ (226.58L).\n### Since the rate of inflow is $1.6 gallon$ ($4.5L$) per minute and the rate of out flow is $0.1 gallon$ ($0.037L$) per minute, we can say that Lydia's small pool will be filled when: \n\n$\\begin{array}}{} 2.6 gallon$s ($\\begin{array}{} 6L\\\\0.07\\end{array}\\begin{array}{} $minute\\\\h\\end{array}\\end{array}$) per minute is greater than 0 and it is less than or equal to $2.6 gallon$-$0.1 gallon$. (This is what it would be equal to: $\\begin{array}{}  2.6 gallon-0.9gallon\\\\2.6 gallon+0.9 gallon\\\\2.6+(2.6+0.9)\\;gallon-\\;0.9\\;\\frac{gallon}{gallon}+0.9\\;gallon+\\;0.9\\;gardon\\\\2.6\\;gallon-0.9\\;gardon-\\;0.9\\;\\frac{gardon}{gardon}\\;+\\;\\frac{gardon}{2.6\\;gardon}(0", "answer": " 40"}

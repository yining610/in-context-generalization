{"text": "Jack can estimate the number of pages in each book since he knows how long it takes him to read each so he will know how many he read and the amount of time it took him to read them. If he reads a chapter for 7 minutes, and there are 330 words per chapter, then he can tell that it takes 5 minutes to read the chapter, which is the same speed as 5 pages per chapter. In each book, there are 6 chapters with 5 pages per chapter, and he could then estimate that there are 30 pages per book, which is close to 40 pages per book.\n\nThe reason he is correct is because the stack of books is 12 inches tall, and 12 inches is 12 divided by 1 inch, which equals 12. He knows from experience to read 1 page every 5 minutes, which is reading 6 pages every hour, and there are 60 minutes in an hour. In each book, it would take an hour to read it, and because there are 12 book, it would take 12 hours to read all of the books and Jack could then estimate how many pages he read in each hour.\n\nThe reason it is accurate is that Jack knows from experience how many books it takes him to read in an hour and thus the pages he reads in one hour.

{"text": "Answer question 3. The input question is asking how to solve for the amount of time, in hours, that she would need to baby sit to earn $70 from $45. \n\nThe steps to solving this problem are:\n- $70 - $45 = $25, which means $1 is equal to $25 / 96 = $0.025 which we can convert to a decimal by using the same number of digits after the comma, 025 =.025\n- 25 - 45/3 = -8, so we will use the negative sign on the final multiplication: -8x3 = -24\n- $45 * -24 / 96 = -5.625, or $-5.625\n\nIt will take her 5625 (5 and 6/10) hours to make (25 \u2013 45) / 3 = $25.\n \n### Input:Which type of tree bears seeds?

Carlotta's performance is 6 minutes, which accounts to 3+5=8 minutes of practicing plus temper tantrums.\n\nCarlotta's singing is 1 minute, and then practice for 3+5 = 4 additional minutes. Her singing time, practicing, and tantrums amount to 1 minute, 4 minutes and 8 minutes respectively.

The number who did not take wine, which was 26 divided by 1 person was divided by 2 to find the different wine groups and this number was added to the sum, which was 17.

{"text": "Harry didn't know that.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe first time that an employee will receive a bonus is based on the employee's tenure, and a bonus of $500 will be awarded to each employee. The calculation for the bonus will be based on the employee' tenure times $500 dollars. The length of the employee's tenures will be in years. \n\nThe length of the tenure must either be multiplied or divided by 10. The results of that operation determines how much money the employee will get. For example, an employee with a tenure of 1 year, 7 months, and 2 days gets the bonus, since 1723 divided by 10 has a remainder of 2 (rounding to the nearest hundredths place). The employee with the tenure gets a bonus of $17,200, and the employee with the tenure of 40 years 10 months and 29 days gets a bonus of $202,500.\n\n### Input\n\nAt a gym, which has various weights, the weights of certain colors are as follows:\nBlue Weights, 2 pounds each;\nGreen Weights, 3 pounds each.\nHarry put 4 blue weights, and 5 green weights on a metal bar.

What amount of weight, in total pounds, does Harry' work weigh?\n\n### Demostration\n\nThe weights that Harry put on the bar are 7 pounds from blue and 15 pounds from green.

Because 425 degrees is reached after 45 minutes, half a minute would be equal to 25 degrees.  This means that the amount of difference between a half-minute and three quarters is zero.

You have the amount of eggs for boys and girls. You can find out how the girls received eggs by subtracting the boys eggs from the total amount of eggs to get 7 eggs for the girls and have 3 for the boys. With the amount of eggs you now know the number of boys is equal to 10 - 7 = 3 girls. You have the name of the family members before and now can count the number of males as a total to get 3.

She would like to keep doing both activities but finds that they don't mix.  What kinds of problems might exist if she continued these activities?\n\n### Demostration 1:She could get injured.\n\n### Response 1: It is likely that the hiker or runner will get injured because doing one after another will fatigue the muscles causing an injury.\n\n### Insight: Both of these activities involve a high amount of cardiovascular activity. If they continue these activities in the same time frame they are trying to do them, they likely won't be able to finish both and will become exhausted. Doing one activity like running will not prepare the muscles for the other activity like hiking.  Doing two of these activity in a few minutes close together will cause the muscles to fatigue and could injure the person doing it.\n\n### Solution: If she wanted to hike she should do other cardio activity later or take more breaks. If she wanted to run, she should try running on a different day to give her body time to regain strength.\n\n\n### Input2: The woman is running a lot with friends in the morning. They need to switch from running to hiking. However she must still run twice a week on her own. She must change her schedule but wants to stay active. What time of day will be best for her?\n\n### Demo: Before she switches her schedule she should think how much of her day to give up? \n\n### Response2: If she is giving up a few hours a day, she should run once she gets home and change to hiking twice a week. Doing her cardio routine early in the morning would be better than doing it all late in the day. In the morning, the muscles have a long amount of time to recover and she may have a better time and not need breaks. Doing this earlier in the day may actually be a better way to start the day because she may have more energy for the rest of her day and feel less tired all day. She might enjoy the rest of her activities more.\n\n### R", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "Answer the question.\n\n## Task 2\n\n### Instructions:Create a program to help a user determine their age.\n\n### Solution:\nFirst the user is asked what their birth (or current) year (Y) is. To determine this we have the program create a loop that starts with 1900 and checks for a user entry year less than or equal to 202X. When entered the Y is assigned to variable `X` which the program then uses in a for loop that iterates over the values starting with 0 for `X` incrementing the value in the for until the value is greater than the entered Y. This then gives `X` the corresponding year from the array: array = `2011, 2012....2021`.\n\nAfter the user enters in their year their answers if correct give their age, if not there message should say that the current or birth year is invalid.\n\n### Notes:\n*You do not have to account for the program being used in a system where the year might not be given in the format that a calendar provides year:month:day. A calendar program could be used if desired, but for the sake of simplicity, just consider their birth/current year to be entered in this system.\n**\n\n## Task 3:\n\n### Instunction:The program below contains a bug that makes it possible to write more money than the program would let the player. Where is the bug?\n\n### Solution\nThe `while true` loop could be put after instead of before the first `int`. If we put the while loop after the first int it would only allow us to do one more than the limit that was input. But, because we have `while true` the loop would continue no matter what the number you entered. So what this would do if you input an amount before 100 or after 100 it would not take the 100 you entered, but start another loop that it would let you enter higher than 100. So the answer would be after the declaration of `i`.\n\n**\n\n### Instuction:Write a method that adds all positive, non-zero ints in an array whose values are less than 100 and returns them as a single value.\n\n### Input\n{3, 6, 9,", "answer": " 2,250"}

If you want to divide 10 by four you need to divide by five, because four divided by five means one and left over is the number four. So to divide it by five just add one more to the total. So let's say our total is 10, then our sum of three even numbers is 5+10. Then we divide by five to make it 10 - 2 = 8. We can now say that our total is the sum of three even number. I chose to add 3 to our total because that made our result even.\n\n### Solution:\nYou can change the length of the same staircase into a flight by adding the same number to each step as shown in the diagram below.\nThe steps are in a row like normal but you want to add the same number to each one until you get to the end of the steps.\n\n### solution:\nYou can change it by dividing the numbers you have by another even number. The example says that you have to change the sum of 3 even numbers into 5. So you have to take out a number that is bigger than all the previous numbers and then subtract it from the smallest number.\n\nYou start at 10 and then divide the rest by three to get 3.5. Now subtract 4 from 5 to get 1. then 4.5, 1, 2.5, 2", "answer": " 100"}

I do not like to talk to other about my fears because they make fun of me by telling me that they do not have the same fears and anxiety that I have.\n\n### Response\nThe fear of making mistakes is a thing that people have to deal with in their own way. If they don't deal with it the right way, it can cause them to be anxious. One example of someone who let the fear of making mistake control her life is a high school senior at my high school. She made a mistake on one of her term papers, and let the fear of making a mistake get to her so that she would not eat. Luckily, she got that issue under control before she caused harm to herself.\n\n### Input \nMy biggest fear is not being good enough.  Even though everyone says they appreciate all that I do for them, I do not know.  Sometimes I feel as if I cannot talk to people about my fears because everyone is so sarcastic and mean.  \nI do not want to let my insecurities show because I know that I am insecure about everything, but I would rather let them show than to stay quiet.\n\n### Respond\nPeople who never share their fears with anybody else will not be the ones who are the most successful. Successful people want to talk about their fears and insecurities, because they know that when they do, they become better people.\n\n### Solution\nWhen I write an important essay like this one, I always write to the best of my ability.\n\n### Source of FEAR\nOne reason why people are afraid to show their fears and insecturites is because of the lack of support and understanding that they will get from other people.  Because of how some people are, people are afraid to share their insecurities", "answer": " 224"}

{"text": "The total number of beakers the lab has is 22. Add 45 for every copper ion present. If you know 22 is even and you can start from both sides and do some long division, you can divide 45 by two for the 18 you know are absent. However, you can also use the logic to find the exact number of copper-ions. Remember, 22 is even, so that means we can use the fact that it will divide evenly into 22/22 which is 1. However, in this case, you don't have an exact match, because you have 8 copper ions, then you have some left over. That is why you would have to add 45.\n\nTo do this you would take the original number, which is the total number of beakers, which is 22. You subtract four from that original number which is 22-4 to get 18. You do that in your head and then you multiply both of those numbers by 100. You're going to divide 45 by that in your head and keep it to one or two digit numbers. You have 22-4/18 * 100 (which is 22 * 100) divided by 45/100 (which equals 45 * 100). You take the product of the entire thing and then you subtract 17. So you take 22 * 6 (6 = 18 * 1). Then you take 45 * 3 (3 = 100 % 100) which is 135 by the way. You subtract that 135 and then your final product is:\n\nYou multiply 22 times 100 and then you subtract 45. To find what is left. The last digit is 5.\n\nSo your final product is 455, which means that 455 beakers have none of the liquid in them. You can take five hundred and add three.

{"text": "36\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n### Instructions:Read this paragraph and answer questions.\n\n> After school, I walk down the street to the park. I find a comfortable seat, pull out my new book, and settle in to read. I notice an old man on a bench nearby, quietly reading his book also.  As I read along, his book opens, displaying the next page. I notice a few pages of what seems to be a handwritten letter, neatly arranged by a typewriter. I decide to watch his reading to see how he finds his next page, and he looks at a picture of a man and woman in an old time photo booth, and quickly turns the page. He closes his book and I turn back to my own reading. After a few moments, the old man's book opens again, and I notice the woman I was just looking at in the old photo. Next, I see a close-up of a woman that resembles both the two women in the photo.  The old man looks at the image and reads the page, which I assume is a typewritten letter. Next, he turns a page with an image of an old photo booth, but instead of looking back to the page he read before, turns the page again.  I realize that the old man is reading stories from my book. I look to see his book title, and it reads \"Owned by the Writer.\"\n\n\n### Demostration:\n\nInput: What would the reader think, if a picture came to life?

Since the sides of the rectangle have to add up exactly to 4(w+1), there's only one combination that works, and it is (2x+1)(5x+1).  If you are unsure what 2x+1 means, the first part of that is the width (2) and then the remaining part of that (+1) is the length. You divide that number by 2 and that's what you get.  So if you keep this in mind, you want (2x+1)/2 * (5x+1)/2, then take their square roots, that is your result.\n\n### Output:Square is not a triangle because the angles never add up to 90 degrees.\n\n### Why\nSquares and triangles are two shapes that you use to make rectangles.

{"text": "Three bedrooms are 1200 sq ft and three gallons are needed per 600 sq ft which means there is 2000 sq ft uncovered.\n\n### Input 3-1.\n\nWhat is the value of a, if (x^2)*(x+a)=(a*x^2)\nOutput answer: 1\nExplaination:\nThe value of x is determined with two (2) simple rules that are as follows:\n\nFirst you put 0 for every element and you make sure that the value of x is even. Then if y is equal to 1 we have 0^2-1^2 = 1 so we know that the value of x which is 0 can not be equal to 1\nSecond you put 2 for every element and you multiply the square and the add the value of x squared. We see that 2^2*2+2^2*2=2 and that 1^2*1+1^2*1=2 so we know that the x value which is even = 2\nthen we conclude that a value of 1 and that this will be the value of x\n\n### Step 3\n\nTo make sure we double check if we double subtract (x^2)*x and we get 0 but if we square of the difference we still get 0 so we know y=0 for every x value. Then for  y=1 we get that x is even and has a value of 2 and for y=2 it stays true because we double subtracted the square values of x so that will always be 0 therefore the answer must be x=1 or 2.\n\n### Step Exercise 1\n\n### Steps 1,2 and 3\n\n### Exercise 1 Question 1 Part 4\n\n### Solution AK's to the problem:\nhttps://github.com/andrewkrolik/Penn-StuG/blob/master/assignment/excise-one/1-AK.md\n\n### Excise 1 question 2\n\n### Solution BK's to the Problem:\nhttps://github\n\n### Excercise 1 question3\n\nSolution:\n\n![pic](./assets/excise", "answer": " 3"}

I then went through each letter combination with the alphabet being used. One of the combinations I came across was the letter \"A\", which indicated park. From there I took the second combination with the letter \"a\", which indicated theatre. Combining both of these options I got the answer park. For the second question I determined the possible answer and then took each one and compared them to a dictionary of known words to see if any of them existed. The answer to the question was hockey game.\n\nFor question three I also determined what the possible answer could be and then proceeded to take each letter combination and combine them until I thought it was the right answer, which was \"sigh\". For question four I determined the possible answers were A or \"sigh\", which led me to put it in the dictionary until I found the right one, which was cap. The fifth question I determined that the right answer was the one that used teacher in it. The \"a-e\" combination led to \"their\". The last question I determined the first two answers and then figured out the rest using trial and error to find the right answer.", "answer": " 250"}

Wherever you see the input= and input(), these are the lines of code that will take the user input. I have created an ans variable, and it is initialized to None. The if statement that checks for the user input to match any condition (as I have mentioned below) returns the output in that case, if not, the output is None.\n\n### The referee called a what when one player punch another? \n\n \n\n```python\nprint(input())\nans = input() \nif ans =='A':\n    print('Penalty box')\nelif ans =='B':\n    print('Time Race')\nelif ans == 'C':\n    print('Football Game')\nelif ans == D:'\n    print('Part Two Boxers')\nelif ans == E:'\n    print('Hockey Game')\n``` \n- In this code block a  line of code has been edited, where I have added more conditionals to check if the user input matches the condition then that output will come out otherwise nothing will come.\n- The condition \"if ans == 'A:' \" this is a line of code that checks if the user input is a string or not. This code block is run only when the user input is in string, the user input can be of any length, so we check for the first character in the string. Ans is the variable that is storing the user input.\n\nif ans =='B': in this condition the variable 'ans' is checked with the value of the variable A (which takes the user input)  and then we can see that this condition has a single 'B', So this condition is run", "answer": " 220"}

(12x15)/3 = 4x5 and then change the numerator so it can be easily factorized. If the numerator 4 is even, then find the factor pair. If the numerator is not an even number to the fourth power, which is to say it is 16, then move the 16 to the power of 4 to the top, 16^4(16*16)=57600.  Then divide 3 to the power of 3, 27, (27/3^3) = 9. Then multiply 4x5x9, 40, then multiply 6 and 5(6*5=30) so 40*30 = 1200. Then get 36 to the power of -1/3 which is to the fourth power, (36^-1/3)^4 = 9, then multiply 1200 and 9 and the 1/5 becomes 180. Then divide it by 180, then 1200/180= 6.666666 or 666.\nOutput: 666\n\nInput: A store owner is looking to replace a broken window in a shop he built 12 years ago.

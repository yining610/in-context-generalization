{"text": "1. The first step in solving this question is to understand the context. Jack is stranded on an island with no supplies, and he has to use what he has to make his meals.\n2. Jack is left with a bucket of seawater, which contain 20% salt. He wants to use that salt to season his fish, but he needs to know how much salt he will get when the water evaporates. From this, we can conclude that it is important to know the exact amount of salt in the seawater, because Jack will not be able to measure the salt accurately.\n3. In order to find the approximate amount of salt left after the water evaporates, we can use the concept of evaporation and salt concentration. When water evaporates, the salt content also decreases, which means that the salt becomes more concentrated.\n4. Jack can estimate the amount of salt left in the seawater by considering the evaporation rate and the salt concentration. If the rate of evaporation is high, then the salt concentration will decrease and Jack will get less salt. To find out the exact amount of salt left, Jack will need to use a salt concentration calculator, such as those found online.\n4. In summary, Jack is stranded and wants to season his fish using salt he collects from seawater. To estimate how much salt he will have left when the water evaporated, he needs to understand how concentration of salt in seawater works and how the evaporation rate affects this concentration.

To find the possible couples, we first need to find the total number of possible pairings or matches. This can be done with the following formula: n(n-1)/2, where n is the number of people.\n6. So in our case, the number of possible pairings is 7530.\n7. To find the number of unmarried couples, we multiple the number of pairings by 2 as it represents the number of possible couplings for 2 people.\n\n8.

We then need to determine the relevant information. We know that there will be 12 people at the party and that each person will have a cup of tea. We also know that each cup of tea will have 6 ounces.\n3. We can write the ounces of tea needed as ounces of tea for 12 people x cups of tea, or ounces of tea x cups of tea.\n4. We can then convert the units of cups to liters by multiplying by ounces of tea per cup, so cups x ounces of tea = liters.\n5. We then know that ounces x cups = liters. We can then rearrange this to liters = ounces x cuip, which we can solve to get liters = 12 * 6.\n6.

We know that there are three cows, two chickens, and eight horses. Each hoof has a different number of toes, which each has a different density, which in turn is a factor of a different size. Therefore, we can conclude that the word 'feet' is used for the number of animals in the context of the question, and that the question is asking for the number of feet in the group of animals, or the total distance travelled by the group of animals. We can then calculate this to be 12 feet: 3 x 2 x 4 = 12 feet of distance.", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "1. The number of bananas divided among the monkeys is dependent on the number of monkey piles, which would total 60 bananas.\n2. As a first approach, assume a pile has 18 bananas. Then, we divide 10 piles by 18 and get 5.6 monkeys per pile. \n3. We also know there are 12 monkeys altogether. So we multiply 5.6 by 12 and get 67.2 monkeys. So, if we assume 18 bananas per pile, each monkey gets about 67 1/18 (378/30) bananas.\n4. However, we must check how the bananas get distributed with more monkeys. \n5. If we assume 20 bananas per pile instead, with 12 monkeys, then each monkey gets 20/12*12 (166/12) bananas. \n6.

{"text": "1. To solve this, we have to understand the context of each part of the sentence. In this case, we start at the beginning, then we work our way through, solving each part of the sentence independently, and then we put it all together.\n2. The first part of the sentence tells us that four people collectively lost a total of 27 pounds in a weight loss contest.\n3. The second part of the sentence tells that the weight loss of the two people (referred to as 1. and 2.) who lost the smallest amount of weight, subtracted from the weight loss of the largest part, 27 and 7 respectively.\n4. The third part of the sentence describes the two remaining people (referred to simply as 3. and 4.) as losing the same amount of weight, which we know from the context from the above sentence.\n5. Since it is not immediately clear how to set up a solution for this using arithmetic operations of the context as it is posed, we must instead use some other operations that make the situation easier.\n6. The key to this problem is to realize that the solution is to be found in the last part of the sentence, in finding that 'the two remaining people lost the SAME AMOUNT'.\n7. It is possible for all numbers in such a sentence to have the same value in such a way that no arithmetic operation can be used to solve it. This is what the key means, a way to find a sum of the missing values.\n8. This means that we have to be able to compare two values in such a way as so that the two values are the same.\n9. Thus we can easily put in the number 27 for the first value, then we simply add the number 7 to the first to get our first weight loss, then we subtract the 2nd from the first. We can do this in a slightly more compact way, however, by using the minus sign instead, which changes the minus sum to this:\n10. Thus, if the two last weight losses were 79 and 86 respectively, then we know that they lost the same amount, and we are now able to derive the amount using just the information in the original sentence.\n11.

In the same way, if 1 bag of chips costs 3 dollars, 3 bags total to 3 dollars.\n2) Subtraction and division: To calculate 3 gallons minus $.79, we can use our 1 to 1 equivalency in this particular case: 3(3) - $.79 = 22.21.\n3) Eligibility: When using 3 bags of chips, it is not possible to use the 1 bag of chis.

By subtracting Y from X, we can conclude that Y < X\n7. Further, 3 cats \u2264 Y so the total number of fish must be X < 2Y\n8. Thus, X = 2Y -8. Substituting for Y = X/2, X = 2(X/2) - 8 or 2X = X 9. So X =2 10. Therefore, Ed has 2 dogs,3 cats and twice the number of fish as there are in cats and dogs combined = 4 fish.\nAnd hence, the total number of pets that Ed owns is 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is A: 9.\n\n1.The last digit in this number is 9.What is the first digit? \n\nInput : 2 1 9 0 ANSWER_1 :2\n\n1.

{"text": "The given statement is a little confusing but can be clarified into the following sentence: \"At a meeting, 40 chair could hold a capacity of 2 persons each and when the meeting was taken over; 2/5ths of them were vacant, leaving the remaining chairs each with 2 persons on them.\"\n\nHere we need to focus on the two conditions of the question:\n\n1. If 2/ 5 chairs were unoccupied.\n\n2. If rest chairs each having 2 persons on them.\n\nThe question now boils down to this: How many people attended the meeting.\n\nAnd the condition is that, when 2/5th chairs are vacant and the remaining chairs each having 5 persons on them. To summarize the sentence:\n\n2/5 of the seats were unoccupied. Then, each of the remaining chairs had 4 people on it which means that overall 4 chairs can take 8 people.\n\nSo, to sum it up, we have the following numbers:\n\n2/ 5 ( 40/1) = 8/ 10 x 40 = 32/ 60 (40) = 4/5 of chairs were unoccupaded\n\nEach remaining chair could seat 4/5 of the people\n\n2. Each remaining chair(capacity of 4/5) can seat 4 on each.\n\nSo now we have the capacity of the chair(4/5 ) as 8 on each.\n\nTotal capacity of remaining chairs= 4/5 x 8  = 12 on each.\n\n2.1. Since, the original sentence mentioned that it should be 2 people per chair. So we take only 2 people on each chair.\n\nThe sum total of all the number of people which can be seated on the remaining 26 people/chair = 26\n\n2.2. (2 people/one chair) * 26 chairs = 52 people\n\n2.3. 52 people attended the meeting.", "answer": " 48"}
{"text": "There are multiple methods of solving this equation.

The first is the definition,\nwhich states that two whole numbers are relatively prime, if their quotient _after division of one of these numbers by another_ is a nonzero whole number. So, first you have to decide what to divide by. You have to divide by either the larger or the smaller one. Let's choose the former.\n\nSo we have the equation:\n4<3\n\n\n\n##2. Then the next step is to translate the two whole numbers into fractions.\nIn the example, you are given this fraction: 2/7\n\nThis means we have to write 27.\n\n## Next we have to identify\na) the two fractions we have\nand b) the division operation\n(in this case 7/2 = 3.5)\n\nSo, we have this : 7/2 =3.5\n\nNow, as I understand, we have to divide both fraction by the \"non-zero\" term. That means we have to divide both fractions by 3 and the result should not be a zero. Let's test what happens when we multiply/divide by 3:\n7*3=21, then 21/2=10.5, but 10.5 is zero so this is not valid.\n2*3=6, then 6/2=3, this is also true, but we don't care right now because we know that 3 is not zero\n\n\n## So what now?\nWell, clearly it can not be both numbers.

Since we are looking to find the number of meals, we can eliminate any choices that include packages from the calculation, leaving us only the following choices:\n4. Choice A is incorrect because it includes both packages and meals in the calculation. Choice B is also incorrect, as it includes both. Choice C includes both but in the wrong place\n5. Finally, Choice D does not solve both packages and meals. The final answer is Choice D which states that 27 packages + 27 meals = 54 packages and meals.\n6.

These values are 3, 16 and 10.\nWe also know that the sum of these values is 3+16+10=59 and that, as we are combining the lengths, we need to add these numbers together.\nThe question now becomes how to do this efficiently.\n\n1. Let's first look at the values and try to identify any patterns or similarities between them.\n2. The first two values both end with a zero in their number, so this could be the only way they are similar. \n3. If we examine the values 3 and 10 again, we see that the first digit is a 3 and the second digit is a 0. We can use this knowledge to help us identify a common denominator.\n4. If we were to multiply both values by a 10, we would multiply the 3 by a 10 and the 0 by a 10 making them look like 30 and 00. This means that the value of 300 will likely be a common denominator for the problem.\n5. Thus it is safe to assume that the 71 in the sum would equal 30 plus 16 plus 10. \n6.

Now we are given two prices for items (which would be bills) and then a total (change).\n2) Lets look in a little detail and break this problem down to smaller, easier challenges.\n3) First of all, to find change back for the $2.05 we would need to divide $2.05 by 5 (which is 41 cents per nickel) we get change of 1 nickel.\n4) Then to find change back for $7.00, we need to divide $7.00/5 which gives us 146 cents or rounding to 150 cents. (50 plus or minus 5 is the range as in the given 49 nickels). Then rounding down we get 5 nickels.\n5) Finally we have $4 left over in case we have extras (which is not the case here). So 146 cats for $2.00 leaves 4 quarters left ($0.25 each) and 1 dime left.\n6) Since there is 1 quarter left, we need a change of 1 quarter, we can subtract the extra penny (from the 146 cts) to get the required quarters needed ($0.25).

The solution step would involve determining the total number of minutes required to walk through section G and section H.\n3. Now, since the number of cars needed to be walked through is x and (x + h) respectively, it is clear that the total number of minutes that would be spent must be: min(x + h)\n4. In order to determine the value of x, we have to consider the fact that: x=15/11 (because Nate can walk past cars at 11 cars per minutes)\nSo min(x + h)= min(11 (x/5) + h. We are looking for h, the number of sections beyond Section G, that is to be added. Thus we can write min(11 (15/11) + h) and simplify it as min(15x/5 + 15/11).

{"text": "1). First, it is necessary to understand the context of this question. The question is asking about the amount of hours someone, John, spends at the gym per week. For this, we need to determine how much the answer is. We need to determine if each time spent at the gym is equal, such as spending one hour lifting weights, and that the cardio is spent at an even number such as 20 minutes.\n2). Next, we need to determine if the number of hours John spends at the gymnasium every week is greater than or less than 6. The number spent at the gym every week is given in terms of \"hours\"\n3). After determining that the number is greater than 6, we can use the statement \"a third of the time John spends lifting weights every day going to the gym\" to determine how long it takes him to lift weights every day. Since he lifts weights for an hour, and does half of the time on cardio we can determine that he spends an hour total at the gym every day.\n4). After calculating the amount of time he spends at the gymnastics every day, we can see that is greater than the amount of time he spent every week. Since John can spend 1/2 the time he lifts weights on cardio, we can conclude that John can spend a total of 4 hours at the gym per day.\nWe can conclude from step 3 that we spend about one half of the weightlifting time at the gym every cardio. We can use this statement to determine that he can spend 4 hours at the Gym, every day. This can be applied for each day that he goes to the gym. 4 hours at the same gym for 3 different days. 4 hours + 4 hours + 23 hours = 27 hours.\nA) John goes to the gym for 3 days every week.

We want to find one that best represents a possible maximum number of guests who will actually show up.\n4) Choice 'A' is \"220-'5'\". This choice says that since there is \"10\" people who will attend the wedding, 220-'10' is the final number of people who will actually attend. This answer is incorrect, as the number 220 is not actually attending her wedding. As stated before, the correct problem is \"What is the possible number of guests who will attend?\"\n5) Choi 'B' is \"10% fewer guests\".

We then need to find the costs of each type of fruit and cream in order to calculate the total cost of each quart.\n3. The first step is determining the cost of the berries. From the given information, we know that 1 quart of stawberry ice cream requires 4 cups of strawberries, and each 2-cup package of strawberries costs $3.00. This means that 4 cups of frozen strawberries cost $12.00.\n4. Similarly, for the raspberry ice crem,n 1 quart requires 2 cups of berries, and 2 cups costs $5.00. This gives a total cost of $10 per quart for the raspberry berries.\n5. To calculate the cost of the cream, we know that 2 cups of cream is required for each quart of berry ice cream, and cream costs $4.00 per 4-cup container.\n6. To calculate the total cost of making each quart of ice cream, we need the combined cost of the fruit and cream required to make that quantity.\n7. In the first case of strawberry icecream, 4 cups of fruit cost $12. We then add the cost of the creme for that quantity: two cups cost $8.\n8. Thus, the total cost of making one quart of strawberry ice cream would be $20.\n9. For the case of raspberry icecream, we have to find 2 cups worth of berries, which cost $10, and add the creme: two cups costs $8.\n10.The total amount needed to make one quart of raspberry  ice cream is $14.\n11.

{"text": "1) The first step is to determine the total earnings. We know that Uki earns $X amount from selling cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits.\n2) Second, use the provided information to estimate the total earnings. Uki bakes an average of 20 cupcakes per day, so we can estimate that she will sell 100 cupcakes per five days. Similarly, she can bake 10 packets of cookies and 20 packets of biscuits, giving her a total of 200 cookies and 400 biscuits sold.\n3) Now we convert the cooking values to their actual cost. Each cookie is worth $2, so we estimate that she sells 200 cookies at $2 per cookie. Similarly, each bite is worth $1, so we estimate that he sells 400 biscuit at $1 per pie.\n4) Finally, we can calculate the total earnings.\nX is the total profit earned by Uki in five days.\nX= (100 * 1.50) + (100*2) + (200*1.50)\nX = 150 + 200 + 300\nX= 650 dollars.\nConclusion:Uki earns a total of $650 in five days.\n\nInput: What do you call your sister?

Against the previous choice of 31 minutes, this choice looks promising as it is slightly closer to the exact ratio of 1:30 that is needed to answer the original question.

We can use the rule of three that states that \"in any situation where 3+3+3 = 1, the extra number will always be zero\".\nIn this case, 3+3+1=1 and because the numbers of pencils are multiples of 10 and each person received an equal share of 10, the sum of the remaining pencils will be zero.\n2)Let 'x' be the number of pencils Ken kept. Because we know that the total pencils Ken gave away are 50, and since all three people received the same amount, it follows that the pencils which Ken kept is equal to: - the amount of pencils Ken gave to Manny + the amount of pencil Ken gave to Nilo \n= -10+10 > -20 = the total pencils he kept.\n3)Since the total amount is > than -20, it can be inferred that the remaining amount is greater than -20 \n= 20+20+20, which does not have an extra number.

Based on the information provided, it is clear that Gary worked extra shifts and earned some overtime.\n2: The next step is to identify the variable (i.e., the unknown quantity or value) that needs to be found. In this case, the variable is the number of hours worked that week.\n3: Then, we apply deductive reasoning to form a logical conclusion based on the information given and any additional facts we know from experience or common sense.\n4: In this case, we assume that Gary normally earns $250 per week (40 hours x $12/hour), but that after working extra shifts he earned some overtime. Based on this information, we can deduct that since earning overtime adds 1.5 times the hourly employee's normal rate to their paycheck, the total paycheck must be greater than the normal $250 per $40-hour week, but less than the standard rate of $12/hour for each remaining hour worked. The total earned is therefore within the range of $250 < total paycheck < 1.5 x $12/hr = 18/hour.\n5. Since overtime rates apply only past the 40th hour and not thereafter, we can conclude that when 40 hours are already accounted for, and the remaining hourly pay is only overtime pay, the 41st hour will be paid at the standard 40-hour hourly rate ($12/hour). So the maximum amount of overtime compensation that can be earned is $696 + $12 = $608, and the minimum is $696-12= $684, so $684 is the minimum amount of hours he worked, and $696 is the maximum.\n6. Finally, we combine all the information and use an equation to solve for the number of hours worked based on our deductive reasoning. We want to find a value for X equal to the number of hours worked, so we can substitute $608 - $12 = $596 into our equation: $596 = $12*(40+X) which can be simplified to: $X = (40+41)/41 = (40+", "answer": " 52"}

The ones digit of both of the multipliers are greater than the hundreds digit of the ones digit of the product. 6. The ones digit of either of the multipliers are smaller than the product of the multipliers.\nOutput: 3.The options given are in an incorrect order. We begin with option 1, which is incorrect. The ones digit of a product is equal to the product of the multiplier and divisor, and it can definitely not be larger than the sum. Hence, 1 is incorrect. We now test option 2 as it comes next logically. This option is incorrect too. The answer to the sum is smaller than the ones digit of both of its addends. Which, in turn, means that the ones digit of the sum is larger than the whole sum. (2 and 8 are both smaller than their ones digit, 12). Hence option 2 is also incorrect. Next we test option 3. A number smaller than its addends cannot be larger than its one's digit. Since 30 is smaller than both of its addends, its ones digits is larger than its sum. Option 3 is incorrect. The next option has the answer to the sum to be smaller than its sum, which is mathematically wrong. 4 and 5 are also incorrect for the same reason. Next, we analyze option 6. This options checks that if the ones digit of the multiplier is greater than the hundreds digit and hundreds digit are smaller than the product. Hence option 6 is also incorrect so we move to the next options 7 and 8. If a product is less than its sum, then its ones digit has be smaller than the hundred's digit of the sum. But option 7 contains this condition. If the products hundreds digit is larger than its ones digit, then it cannot be smaller than 1000. Hence 7 is incorrect and option 8 is the last option.

The first step in solving this problem from the OG is to identify the relationship between the ages, which is given in the sentence that says that they have an age difference of 6 years and that in 2 years, Claire will turn 20. \n1.From these relationships, we can deduce that: Jessica is at least 34 years old. Why? Because in 2 years, at most, Claire will turn a total of 22, and since Jessica is older than Claire, she must be at least 26 - 6 = 20 years old, which is impossible since the oldest possible age for Jessica is 34.\n2. Now we can conclude that Claire will be at least 14 in two years since 20 - 14 = 6 and since Jessica will be at least 20, or \"turning 20\" in two years means that she will be at least 46, and there are no other options provided.\n3. So to complete the problem, we only need to determine Jessica's age today. We know that in two years, Claire would be \"turning 22\". We can express this as \"22 minus 2 = 20\", meaning that in two years, Jessica will be 46 - 2 = 44 years old.  4. To solve the problem further, we know that in two years Claire will be 45 or younger because the relationship between their ages is that Claire will be 14 years younger than Jessica in two years.   5. To figure out how old Jessica is in terms of the \"elapsed years\", the formula to use is (45 - (the younger one's age in two years) = (older one's age today).

{"text": "1: The first step is to interpret the question, which gives us the given information regarding Bucky's work ethic.\n2. Now the goal is to create expressions, using the available information, to solve the problem.\n3. To solve this problem, we need to know something about the quantities, so that we can create a relationship between the quantities. In this case, we know that Bucky earns $5 for every trout caught and $4 for every blue-gill caught.\n4. From the information given about him earning $35, we can say that the number of trouts caught is more than or equal to 1 and the number of blue-gill caught is less than or equal to 21.\n5. Now, the given sentence talks about how much he needs to save before he can afford to buy the video game.\n6. To compute how much he needs to have saved,we use the given fact that 60% of the total money earned is spent on catching trout, and the remaining portion is spent on catching blue-gill.\n7. If the amount spent on catching trouts is less than or equal the the amount spent on blue-gills, then obviously Bucky has enough to fulfil his goal. And if the amount spent oncatching trouts is greater than the amount spent on blue gill, then Bucky would be unable to fulfill his dream at the current rate of saving.\n8. Now using the knowledge about the percentage spent that 60% is trout and 40% is blue gill, we express the amount Bucky saved (the amount spent on blue- gill) in terms of the total money earned (including both blue and trout) and the amount saved (saved for buying the game).\n9. As Bucky earns $35 each week, that means he earns 13$/wk. His percentage saved each week is 60% of that, so he saves 7.80$ a week, and the total amount saved is 7.8*13=96.4$.\n10. Given that the cost of video game is $60, we express the saved amount of money in terms of the price of the video game, so that we can decide if Bucky can afford the game or not.\n11.

We need to find the percentage of each type.\n2. Once we have identified the information, we need to organize it. We can organize this data by calculating the total number of bars and then dividing the different types into this total, getting the final percentage.\n3. Therefore, to solve this problem we need to know the total number of bars, we can do this using the following formula.\n\nTotal number of Bars = 100/25 = 4\n\n4. Next, we can divide the total number of bars by the number of each type of bar.\nMilk Chocolate = 4/5 = 0.8\nDark Chocolate = 25 = 40%\nMilk Chocolat with Almond = 25/7 = 3.14159%\nWhite Chocolate = 6/7 = 0.86\n\n5. Thus, we can conclude that the percentage of milk chocolate is 0.8% and the percentage of dark chocolate is 40%, the percentage of milk chocoate with almond is 3.14 and the percentage of white chocolate is 8.6%. This gives us the final answer that the percentage of each type is milk chocolate with 0.8%, dark chocolate with 40%, milk chocolate with Almond with 3.14% and white chocolate with 8.6%.\nSo the final answer in percentage is Milk chocolate with 74.005%, Dark chocolate with 35.99%, Milk chocoate with Almond with 2.348% and White chocolate with 10.315%.\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question below.\n\nI am a famous supermodel.

{"text": "1. The first step in solving this problem is to translate the question. This is accomplished by finding the answer to the question.\n2. The question is asking how many cups per day Sarah must consume to meet her daily minimum? This translates to the question, \" How many cups does Sarah need to eat each day to cover the total shortfall amount?\"\n3. The shortfall quantity can be found by determining the number of cups per day Sarah will have to eat beyond the 2 cups per day recommendation, based on the number of cups of vegetables eaten on the last 5 days (6 cups in total). We begin by determining which amount is larger between the 8 cups currently eaten and the 2 minimum per day recommendation, thus 8 > 2, meaning Sarah has eaten more than 2 cups for 5 days, we can thus subtract 2 cups from 8 cups to find the total number of cups she has had to eat over the last three days.\n4. We see that the total cups eaten equals the cups eaten over the last three days minus the 2 minimum. In other words, 3 cups minus 2 cups equals the total cups eated over the last three days, which is equal to the first 6 cups eaten. This leaves Sarah at 2 cups short of the 2 cups minimum per day recommendation.\n5. Once the total cups eatten is found, the number of vegetables that needs to be consumed each day to cover this shortfall can be calculated.\n6. 2 cups/day * the # of days required to cover shortfall of 2 cups/vegetable = the number of vegetables needed each day to cover shortfall.\n7. 2 cup/day * 6 days = 48 cups/vegetables needed to cover the short fall in vegetable consumption for each day.\n8. The final answer is 48 cups of vegetables needed to cover the 2 cups shortfall in vegetable consumption.\nSo the answer is 48 vegetables needed to cover shortfall.", "answer": " 3"}

So the total number of remaining pennies on each box will still be the same.\n2. The next step is to create a formula that can be used to find the 2nd part of the problem. Since there's 2 pennies on each compartment, and she adds 6 pennies to each of the compartment, the new total of pennies on each would become 8.\n3. After solving for the number of pennies of each container, all you have to do is add up all the new numbers to get the answer.\n4. So the answer will be 10 because the new total of pence in each box after adding would be 10 for the first three boxes and then it will gradually increase by 1 every container.\nThis is how you solve for the number of pence in the 3rd container since the new total (which is 8) is an odd number.

Formula and solution(dp):\n\nDP = DP - DP\n4) First, we calculate the discounted price(DP) for each store.\n\nDP = $950 * 0.06 = $57\nDP = \u20ac920 * 0.95 = \u20ac870.10\n5) Since we are subtracting each store price, we need to adjust the formula's calculation. This is because the store at a higher price (\u20ac920) is smaller than the store at a lower price ($950).\n6) To get the difference, we therefore need to find a way of making the \u20ac920 smaller to make it equal to the discounted price of $57. We can do this by using the difference formula:\n7) The difference between two numbers(n1 - n2) in this case is (\u20ac920 - \u20ac57)\n8) Since we are looking for the difference in store price DP, we need to add the difference to the discounted store price. DP = DP + \u20ac920 - \u20ac920.\n9) We have found the price that we need to subtract to get the difference(dp).

The garage was three stories underground and each floor had 850 spaces with two spaces every six feet. My last weekend\u2019s total was $212. The garage\u2019s parking system was programmed to charge drivers $0.25 for each full six feet of parking time. A quarter went into a slot and the whole charge was subtracted from my credit card.\nOutput: The key to answering this question is to understand what each term means and how the answers are calculated. The first step is understanding the question. It asks for the number of six feet of parking that cost $214 dollars.\nThe term \u201csix feet of parking\u201d refers to the width of the car park, as parking spaces are usually six feet wide.\nThe term \u201cparking that cost $212 dollars\u201d refers to the cost of the parking space, which is calculated by the number of feet of parking times $0.25, which in this case is 850 feet multiplied by $0.25 or $212.50.\nThe term \u201cfull six feet of parking\u201d is important, as it refers to the number of feet of car park that have been used, so the answer would be 100. The last line of the calculation explains the parking system, and how it operates, by referring to a quarter going into", "answer": " 186"}

We know that there are 2400 imported bottles + 1200 imported bottles = 3600 bottles total, and 400 of these are reserved for the party. So we multiply the number of bottles reservered for the party by one-third: 400 bottles * 1/3 = 133.33 bottles. So the answer is 2400 - 133.46 = 2364 bottles of imported wine.\nOutput: The answer here is that Jose's cellar will hold 2364 imported bottles of wine and 1200 domestic bottles of wine (500 bottles) for the party, so 2364 + 1207 (500) = 3571 bottles.\n\n#### 28", "answer": " 2400"}

Now, we can use an easy formula to determine the number of gigabytems left to be used; if the user has already used x amount of storage space, then it should be (16 GB - 50% of x) left, as the user would not have more than the total amount of usage left to be used.\n3.

In this problem, we would consider that Jake is retrieving all the red notes, which includes putting them all in the complaint's bin and blue notes which includes putting them all into the compliments bin.\n4. Next, we consider the constraints of the problem, such as the number of red and blue notes available.\n\n5. We begin by counting the number of red notes because it is the more apparent of the two. We know there are 5 rows, which contain 6 red notes in each row (6 x 5 = 30). There are also 10 blue notes at the bottom of the communal board, making it 30 + 10 = 40 red notes.\n6. Now the blue notes are added to that which makes it 40 + 20 = 60 red notes.\n7. Next, the complaints bin will have 60 red notes, which are only one fewer than the number of red notes in total.\n8.

{"text": "1) This question is asking about the amount of running someone does based on how long they watch a movie.\n2) The question states: When Paul runs, he runs at an average pace of 1.5 miles per hour. To figure out the amount of miles he runs during a movie session, we need to know how long each movie is.\n3) The question asks how many miles Paul runs while watching two movies. The number of miles Paul runs depends how many minutes he spends watching each movie. The time the movies are being watched is the number of minutes they are watched, not the number of hours.\n4) To determine how many miles Paul runs, we can use the formula: Miles Paul runs = movies * watch time per movie.\n5) For movies, we use the number of movies he is watching and the time each movie is watched. For watch time per movie, we use the time each movie is going to be shown. \n6) For Paul running, we want to know how many minutes he spents running. We can use the formula Miles Paul runs = 12 minutes per movie * (2 movies watch time).\n7) So the correct answer is C: 7.2 Miles\n\nInput: A school building is $100 million dollars in debt.

How many socks of each colour does he have?\n\nOutput: This problem can be broken down into two independent problems: 1. We must calculate the ratio of blue socks to red socks. That is, we must find the number of red socks over the number of blue socks. To find this, we must first find the numbers of blue and red socks so that each can be divided by the other. So the first part of the problem is: We must find the number of Joe's blue socks, that is, 26 blue sock. Solving this problem, we find 1 blue sock = $26 = (26/1)$\nHence the number of blue sock is 26. So the above equation can be simplified and rewritten as: 26 / 24 to represent the same quantity. Hence, the division result is: $4/3$\n2. After we solve the above equation, we use the solution to solve the main problem. So, the main problem after the simplification is reduced to calculating the ratio of blue sock to red sock.\n(26 / 26) = 1 = 1 / 26\n\nHence, the number of red sock is:\n$1 \\cdot 24=26$\n3.

This indicates that there are 100 total flowers.\n\nThe next step is to calculate the ratio of greens vs. yellows and purple. Since we already know there are 10 purple flowers and 10 yellow flowers, the ratio is 1:1.

Likewise, 24 is substituted for `yellow` since there are 24 `yellow` hard hats.\n\n4. The statement also indicates that Carl takes away `4` pink hard hats.\n5. So in the first step of substitution, we substitute `4` for '`pink`'.\n6.

And then to find out how many more green hard hats than `pink` John takes away, we multiply 6 by 2 to get `12`, then we substitute it as well.\n8. Then we finally substitute the values for Carls 4, Johns 12 and the remaining \"twice\"\n9. As, there are 12 more 6's than pink hats that are already subtracted away\n10.

{"text": "1. Given the question, we need to answer the question of how many marbles does Baze end up with after her friend gives her more marbles.\n\n2. To do this, we start by finding out how many marbles Baze had in total, and how many marbles she lost.\n\n3. We can answer this by looking at the values and formulas of a proportion.\n4. So we have: 25 marbles total, of which she loses 20%. Therefore, the loss is 5 marbles.\n\n5. She then doubles her marbles, so we now have:\n\n6. From this, we can see that she ends up with the amount of marbles that she had in the first place plus the double of the marbles she lost. So her final total is 25 + (25 * 2) = 25 + 50 = 75 marbles.

To simplify, the question says I should pay a certain amount to 20% of a certain price.\n\n3. Given this, we take the formula: profit = price * % profit. So if we want to find the profit, we can calculate it with the formula.\n\n4. Also know, that the profit = price * the % profit we wanted. So if we know %, we can calculate price to work out the profit. Now, the only question we have left is then how do we work out the price?\n\n5. This we can answer by using the formula: price = profit/100. Since price = profit/120%.\nSo we already know the profit and what we want to divide it by. We then have to remember that 20% = 0,2 so 200%= 2 times 100% \n. So price = profit/2.\n\n6. So, to answer the question we now need to work out the profit,", "answer": " 60"}

The question then asks us to determine the age of Ironman given that Thor's age was provided at 1456. The age of Ironman is calculated by performing the following steps:\n\n1. The first step in solving the question is to determine the age of the oldest individual, which in this case is Thor. Since we are given that Thor is 14 years older than Captain America, we determine that Thor is 108 years old.\n\n2. Next, we determine the age of the middle individual, which in this scenario is Captain America. Since Captain America is 148 years old, we can use this information to determine the age of Thor to be 1456 + 148 = 1604.\n\n3. Finally, we determine the age from the youngest individual, which in this specific case is Ironman. Since Ironman is 16 years younger we can assume that he is 1454 years old. Now we have the age of Thor, 1604, and we also have the age of his middle peers, Captain America and Ironman. This allows us to solve the age of Thor to 1456*13 + 16 = 1454 + 16 =1670\n\n4.

{"text": "1) The first step is to determine the total amount of gallons needed. We can use this simple formula to determine the total amount.\n2 gallons + 10 gallons x number of regular washes + 20 gallons x number bleached loads = 1.5 gallons + 1.4 gallowns + 1.4 gallons\n2. This results in 2.7 gallons per regular wash and 2.7 + 2.7 +2.7 = 8 gallons per bleached load.\n3. We determine the total amount of water needed by multiplying 8 gallons by the number of loads that need to be bleached (2) and adding that number to the total of 2 gallons + 2.7 x 10 gallons (2.7x10). Thus, we need 8 gallons + 2 gallons = 10 gallons to bleach 2 loads and 8 gallons times 2 = 16 gallons for the regular washes. The total amount of water used for this application will then be 10 gallons + 16 gallons or 26 gallons.\n\nInput:A family consisting of five people uses approximately 250 gallons of gasoline each month for gasoline consumption in the home.

This can be done by determining the total amount of galls per month used by the family for gasoline in the home then subtracting the amount of gasoline used for driving.

{"text": "The first thing we need to do here is look at the question carefully and see what information we can glean about the situation. We know that in the first egg hunt, Tank had 10 more eggs than Emma, and in the second egg hunter's total eggs were twice as many eggs as Emma. We know that the other six egg hunters had 400 eggs in all. So the only thing we can deduce is that all six egg hunters had fewer than Emma in the second egg hunn.\n\nSo the second thing we can do here is look at how many eggs Emma had in each round. If we think of one egg as one dollar, then 10 more eggs is really just 10 extra dollars in the first round of the egg hunt for Tank. In the second round, she collected 60 eggs, which is twice as many eggs as her, she would have collected 120 extra dollars. So in the second round, she spent 120 more dollars than she did in the first round.\nNow, we just add up all the people's money in round two. For Tank, she had 120 more. For Emma, she had 100 more. For the other five egg hunters, they had to be more or less than Emma, so they must have been less than 100 more, but they must also be more than 100 less than Emma, because the total is 120 more than in the previous round.\nSo now we can think about our options. If we are asked to determine how many eggs Emma gathered in the second round, then we know our answer is 20 more than Tanks, but we still have one more thing left to find. If we want to find out how many eggs each of the other five egg hunts had, since we know that it is less than Emma's egg count, then we just have to do some more subtracting until we get to a number less than 10, which is 5, or 10 + Tank's count.\nThe next thing we can do is look at what information we had before about our solution.

We can eliminate the information about how many dandalions puff's he gave to his friends, and his dog.\n2. We know the number of dandalions puff he picked 40, and he gave them to other people 3,15,5,2 and then divided the remaining puffs equally among 3 friends, let's call it K puffs. It is because if K+3+15+5+2 (the ones given plus the ones divided) =40, we know that this number is correct\n3. We know there was 40,9,27(40=9+27), and then 27-24 (3+15+15)=24(27=24+3), so then K=27-24=3.\n4. In order to know the answer you have to take it away from 3.

She goes to school on weekends too so we add 2.57 + 1(Saturday) = 3.57 total days for her school week.\nEach day at school is 4.5 hours long. 3.57 days * 4.5(hours) = 16.49 hours per week. 16.4 = 16 + 0.49. That gives us 49 minutes.\nIt does not make sense to add 0.49 to hours in a day, so we round up the 49 minutes to 50 minutes.\nWe can subtract 50 minutes from each of the 3 activities she does in a day, giving us the following hours per day:\n  48:30 sleeping time  35:50 working time  56:00 time at school\nSo she has 5.0 hours per day left over on average. \nWe can apply all this to the original question by taking 35.50 - 56 = 20.50 (hours) left over to work part time.

{"text": "10. The first step is understanding the context of the sentence - the sentence is describing a porch that was swept with more dust particles left behind after the porch was clean. Hence, the number of dust particles on the porch is more than the number of dust particles that would have remained if it was swept beforehand.\n2. Let's look at the choices given - Choice A: All of the numbers after 223 are multiples of 11. This means that their values are equally or unequal sums of consecutive natural numbers. We also know that the numbers in the multiples of 10 (e.g. 60, 120, 180) cannot be in these numbers. Hence, Choice A cannot be an option.\n3. Choices B and C have similar properties, with differences in their values, and are also multiples of 12. However, as we determined with Choice A, it cannot be one of these numbers either. \n4. Hence, the answer can be obtained by subtracting 10 from the values of the integers presented in these choices.\n5. So the answer would be 10 less than any of the choices (212 - 80 - 50 - 12 = 10).

We can do this by dividing 20,70 by 134. The result is 1.507 pieces. Remember that there is a decimal in that (point) part. So you need to round it up or down to the nearest whole number.

This info is provided by the Skipper's GPS device, which tells him that he is one-third of the distance to his destination.  This can be interpreted as 1/3 of the total distance traveleld in this problem.  Next, we need to find the total distance that the ship would have been traveling if the wind storm never happened.\nTo figure out the total distance travelek, it is helpful to go through each one of the steps of the problem.  Since the Skipper sailed halfway to his destination at a speed of 20 hrs at 30 km per hour, he traveled at a total distance of 20 x 30/60 = 20/3 = 6.67 km.  Then on the second day, he traveled for an additional 20 hours at 30 km/hr = 6.6 km, bringing the total distance traveked to 12.67 km.\nTo find the distance that was blown backward b the windstorm, we need to know the velocity of the wind and the time it lasted.  We are told that the storm lasted for 5 hours, so the total distance the wind was blowing the ship during that storm time is: total distance of wind x time of wind = 5 (hours x 5 hours) = 25/2 = 12.5 km\nOnce we know these two values, we can make a table to summarize our calculations and find the answer:\n\n| Distance | Skipper 1st Day |\n:---:|:---:|\n| km | 6.67 |\n| Distance after storm | km |\n:---: | :---: |\n| Total distance traveled | 12.66 |\n:---:: | :---: :\n| Wind distanced traveled | 25/2 |\n:---: :\n\nSince the total distance traveleaad is 12.60 km, the distance blown back by the storm is 12.5 / 12.6 = 0.98 km.\nThe final answer is 0", "answer": " 200"}

How much did they pick?\n- So we have to take the 332.793 into account.\n\nSo the Units are in Pounds.\n\nSo from point 2.\nSo 1st we have to get how much are there for one kilo?\n\nso 1 X 82.616 =826.16\n\nso we subtract from that 128 and the result is:\n799.6.\n\nso we get:\n128/799.6=0.158359672 which means that it is more than 1 so we take the rest left as.276640\nso when we take this.2766 out of 4, the rest is 3 which we multiply 3 by.2766(since it is in the rest), it gives 304.6\nSo, the final answer is:\n304.6 - which is the Answer.", "answer": " 7"}

So the total amount rainfall observed for the first 15 day sis (15)(4)=60 inches.\n\nNext for the remaining days of the month that is, total 16 days, the rainfall amount per day is double the amount observed during the earlier 15 days. The daily average for the remaining days is thus 8 inches.\n\nThus the average rainfall amount for the whole month of November can be calculated  as  18x (60+96) = 96\n\nThus, the final answer is 96 inches which is correct", "answer": " 180"}
{"text": "1: Since we have a rectangle of area, we can get the perimeter of this rectangle by simply adding up the numbers along one side of it. Here, the sandbox has length of 2x and breadth of 2x. 2x + 2x = 30 feet, so its perimeter is 40 feet. Now, we need to find the width of the sand box. 2x refers to the length, and as length is 2x, then width is x. So the answer is 'x', length being 2x, and width being x, makes the area of the sandbox square.\n\nInput:  There are 24 hours in a what? Choice: A: day B: month C: minute D: week E: year\nOutput: 1)Let's first understand what a 'Day' is. A day is the time it takes for the earth to rotate around a full circle, and we have 24 hours in one day.\n2) Now, to determine which of the 5 options (A-E) is the best fit for the context of the sentence, we first eliminate all options except 'E' i.e. 'Year'. Now, if we analyze the structure of the sentence 'There are 24 hours and a what', when 'and' is joined with the what that is the choice to be made.  Since there are 24 hours(of a day) and a year, hence 'year' is the best correct answer.\n\nInput: In what season is it easiest to see the northern lights? Choice: A): Summer \tB): Fall \tC): Spring \tD): Winter \tE): All seasons\nOutput: Let's first determine what 'Northern Lights' refers to, which is a natural phenomenon also referred to as 'Aurora Borealis'. This can be done by analyzing the structure of the sentence- 'In which season is it easiest to......', this indicates that one needs to determine the best season of the year to see Northern Lights.\nNow, to determine the correct answer, we see that in the option 'D' the word 'Winter' is correct since 'Winter' is the time of the year when the northern lights become visible. So the answer is D: Winter.\n\nInput:The word for the day was ____.", "answer": " 5"}

{"text": "1)In this question, Kimberley, Ela, Houston, and grammy are given as inputs. Kimberley, Ela and Houston are the names for the girls and grammy is a grammy or grandmother.\n2) We must collect data about the weights of the three girls and their grandmother so that we can determine how much firewood is collected together.\n3) One way to collect data is to list out how many pounds each girl collected individually. This can help us understand how much firewood each girl collected.\n\n4) Another way to collect data is by using variables to represent the weights of each girl and their grandmother. In this case, We can list out the data as follows: Kimberley's weight = 10 pounds of firewood, Ela's weight=? lbs of firewood, Houston's weight=12 pounds of fire wood, and grammy's weight=? pounds of firewood.\n5)  Now that we have listed out how much firewood each person is carrying, let's find out if the three girls (Kimberly, Ela, Houston) and their grandmother have a total weight of 35lbs. By substituting the individual weight values (Kimberly's weight = 05, Ela's weight =2, Houston's weight =3, and Grammy's weight =3) from their respective slots into the weight equation, we can determine exactly what the \"?\" value is according to the equation.\n6) Now that we have solved for the \"?\" value in the weight equation, we know the total weight collected among the four people (Kimberley, Grammy, Ela and Houston) is 35 lbs. Let's substitute the total weight collected by the four people as the value under \"?\". This way, we can determine exactly how much firewood Ela has collected.\n\n7) It's important to note that the value in the subscript under \"?\" can be any number, including negative or zero. It does not necessarily have to be the actual amount of weight each girl has collected. In other words, We don't have to collect the exact weight of each person. Instead, we can use numbers that help us solve for the \"?\" value.\n\n8) So, We can determine that Ela has collected 12 pounds of wood.\nSo", "answer": " 13"}

It is not asking how many red balls are there, but rather how many green balls are.\n2. Next, the question is asking us to determine the number of green balls when we have certain information about other balls. In this case, we know the number of each color of balls is given. For example, it tells us that Ryan has 40 balls \u2013 11 are blue, 11 are green, and the remaining 18 are either red or some other color.\n3. We are also told that the number of red balls is double the number of blue balls. This means if we know the number of blue balls, we can easily determine the number of red balls (by adding 2 to that number).\n4. To start, we will look at the number of blue balls since the answer is found by adding 2 to that original number. Since there are 11, adding 2 gives us that there can only be 13 red balls.\n5. This makes it to the next step, which includes determining the number of green balls. If we know that the number of red ball is 13, then knowing how many red balls Ryan has tells us that he must also have 11 green balls.\n6. In other words, Ryan has 11 + 13 + 11 = 35 green balls.\n7.

Where $15 is the price for a carwash that we derived from the original question.\n4. Hence, option A can be eliminated. As the cost of each carwash is 15 dollars it can\u2019t be expressed in terms of % or cents, hence option D can be ruled out also. As n can be either 15x or 20x, it can not be multiplied by 60% either, option B can be eliminated too.\n\n5. So, the cost of each wash is 15 dollars.

Based on the information provided, we can draw the following diagram using what we already know:\n\nInput:The diagram indicates that there are 50 people, with each paying $100 (a total of $5,000) towards a high school reunion with the total party costs coming out to $500 less. So if we follow the given diagram, we can say that the cost is $4,500.\n\n3. Now we move on to the multiple choice.

Therefore 4300 does not fit in the diagram and can be eliminated as an option\n\n4,400 indicates that, $5,400 has been spent and hence the diagram indicates that this number does not fit.\n\n$400 is the total amount of contributions, whereas the diagram indicates $5000, so $400 does not fit the diagram and hence can be eliminated. \n\n$3,500 indicates that, the total amount of contributions is $4,550, but the diagram indicates that $5,00 has been used, so $3500 does not fit as there is a difference of $350 between the diagram number and the total number. Hence $3,50 can be eliminated. This leaves us with $325 and $4600.\n\nSince $325 is the difference in the given data and the diagram, it is correct in fitting the diagram and hence is the correct answer is $32", "answer": " 4500"}

It is asking for a strategy for finding the answer to a multiplication problem if we forgot our calculator.\nTo find the answer without a calculator, one could use a strategy called the \"array method,\" which involves making a table with different values arranged in rows and columns to represent the multiplication problem.\nFor example, if you are multiplying 3 and 4, you could write 3 in the first row and 4 in the first column, and then fill in each cell in the table with the product of the numbers in that row and column. This would give you the answer of 12.\n\n2) By taking advantage of multiplication shortcuts and strategies, such as knowing the factors of 1 to 10, you could find an approximation of 3 x 4 without having to go through the process of drawing an array. For example, you know that 2 = 6/3 and 24 = 8 x 3, so the product of 3 and 4 would be close to 24 x 3 (or 12)\nAfter filling in the table for the first few multiplication examples, you may be able to estimate the products and their corresponding columns more accurately.\nBy using this strategy, you can quickly and accurately estimate products without having to write them down or use a calculator.\n\n3) The final answer is: \"I'd have to use an array to find it.\"", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "1. The first step in answering this question is to understand the context and word usage.\n\"Luxury\" in this sentence means \"high quality\", \"made of silk\" refers to the fabric used to make the dress, and \"friend\" refers to the plural version of \"friend\".\n2. Alex makes luxury dresses with silk. Alex makes 900 dresses and has 600 more silk for his friends. Alex will use the rest to make clothes himself.\n\"Alex makes the dress\" means that \"Alex makes dresses\" because there is an s in the sentence \"Alex makes.\"\nThe last sentence means \"Alex uses silk to make dresses.\" This is the case because there is an s and an s in the sentence.\n3. In the initial 900-dress limit, each friend needs around 10 meters of silk to make a dress. 6 friends x 10 m = 60 m.\n4. After the friends cut 60 m, Alex uses leftover silk to make dress for himself. How much silk is left?\n5. If we think about this as a simple calculation we can find the answer to this by subtracting 60 from 900. The number 600 comes from the number of meters of silk from which the friends made 60, and 900 comes from the amount of meters with which Alex made 900 dress. With those two, we get 240 meters. Alex can use 240 meters to make his own clothes.\n6. The answer is 900 + 20 + 60 + 240 = 1020 dresses.

'A' - this is the first choice and does not describe any of the three parts of the problem. So, it is out.\nb. 'B' - 45 apples are remaining. Let us understand how:\n1. The total number of 'apples' that Bill picked = 50 + 3 x 2= 50+6+6= 62.\n2. '3 apples' are assigned to each of his 'two children'. Now let's think about the number of children. In the given problem, we are told that he picked 50 appes from the orchard. Thus, he has picked one less apple than the total number of apples assigned to his children plus the total number of appes picked by his children. Since he picked 50, he picks all the children's assignments and then more. So, that leaves him with one apple less making it 59-1= 58 apples.\n3. Bill's wife makes two 'apple pies' which each require a total of 10 apples to make. Thus, she needs all of the apples that Bill is assigned to the two children. But again we look at what we have, Bill now has 58. To make it equal, he must give her 58-10= 48.\n4. Now, the total of all 'apples' used in the above cases is 58+48= 106. Thus, after the above usage, he still has 62 apples and he is out of them.\nSo option B is the correct answer.", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "1. The question states that there are 3 different products available, each with a different price structure. A smartphone costs $300, a personal computer costs $500 more, and an advanced tablet costs the sum of those two products (i.e. $300 + 500 = 800).\n2.

In order to answer this question correctly, it is necessary to determine the total cost of buying one of each of the 3 items.\n\n4. To calculate the cost, we first determine the cost of one advanced tablet. The cost is $800, and the total cost of one advanced table would be 800 dollars since it is the sum of the cost of the smartphone ($300) and personal computer ($500).\n\n5. Then, we need to determine the cost of purchasing one personal computer. The cost is $500 more ($500 + 0 = 500), so the cost of purchasing a personal computer is $800.\n\n6. Finally, we need to determine how much it would cost to purchasing 3 different items. The cost of one personal computer is $850, and the advanced tablet costs $1000 so it will cost $1,850 to buy all three items.\n\n7. This information can help make the decision as to whether it is better to buy all three items or to choose to by only one or two of them.\nSo the final cost would be $1,85 to buy all three items and the answer is $1,85", "answer": " 2200"}

We have the following information: Henry collected 11 seashells, and Paul collected 24 seashells (initial).\n3. So we can conclude that Henry and Paul initially collected 35 seashells (initial) altogether.\n4. We know that Leo gave a quarter of the seashells he collected from the beach to a younger kid he met, so the remaining 2 quarters out of the 3 quarters he collected has to be accounted for in some way.\n5. We can deduce that Leo gave away 14 seashells and the remaining seashells are a quarter of 24 seashell, or 7 (this is because he gave away 14 out of 24, which is already accounted for).\n6. We can deduce, based on the question, that the initially collected total of seashells was 59.

Mary gave Luna one cup less and her husband gave Luna one cup more, and three cups more than Mary. 3.

This indicates that the question wants area information for each individual section.\n2. In order to find the area of the perimetre, we must first determine the perimetre. We can use an inequality to do this. We can write: perimetre > 30 inches.\n3. Then we can use the property of absolute value to re-write this inequality: abs(perimetre - 30) > 30.\n4. Finally, we use the distributive property to set perimetre equal to two other values: perimetre = length * 2 + width * 4.\n5. The answer is length * 2 + 4 * width, which is: 1.", "answer": " 44"}

And the second statement says if we solve for our value of $D$ ($0.0225$ the second dog should eat 3.5 cups of food) now this will also give us an answer which means $1.5*2= 3$. So $2.5 ( 3 \\times D)$ cups of food will be eaten by the third dog. So adding this to the total of the first and the second D will give us the total dog food eaten.\n\nThe final equation will be $3D + 2.5D = 15D$ which is $3D = 3.75D$.\n\nSubtracting 3.75 from both sides we have: $2.25*D = D $ Which means $D=600$ cups per day. So the total amount of dog food needed will be $3\\times 600 = 1800$. So the answer is 1800 cups.\n\nSo final answer is: 1800cups is the total of the required amounts for 3 dogs.", "answer": " 10"}

If the pitch of a song is 440 Hz (440 cycles per second), and the song lasts for 4 minutes, how fast is the frequency of the songs pitch (in Hz)?\nOutput: To figure out how fast the frequency of the song is, we can use our knowledge of the speed of sound (330 m/s) to find its frequency. The faster the sound, the higher its frequency, because more waves of sound pass through the air in a given time (in this case, 2 seconds or 4 / 330 = 0.125 seconds). \n \nThere are 4 minutes in 4 * 60 = 240 seconds and 0.12 seconds per cycle, so the frequency is:\n240 * 4 / 0.12 = 2400 / 0.10 = 24,000 Hz\nSo the answer is 24,024 Hz or 24.024 kHz.\n\nInput: What time is it when the minute hand of the clock points to 3 and the hour hand points to 12?\nOutput: To know what time the clock is, we need to use a few different mathematical formulas.\nWe start with the formula for the interval in minutes and hours, using this formula the number of minutes is 60 * t or 60 times the time. The time is (12 / 12) + t / 60, or in words: ((3/12) + t, where t is expressed in minutes.\nWe can now replace the formula for time and the t for the hour hand with the t for the minute hand and the number of minutes we were looking for.

{"text": "1-The first step is to read the question carefully and understand the context. In this case, the context is that Mark loves to go to the theater and he intends to visit the theater for at least one performance per week.\n2- We can start by writing down what we know so far. We know that Mark loves to see shows at the theater, and that he intends to visit for at least an hour per week.\n3- We can rewrite our initial statement to give us a starting point. We can say that Mark intends to visit theater at least 1 hour per week. This allows us to begin breaking down the problem and finding solutions.\n4- We now need to solve a system of equations that will give us our answer. To solve these equations, we can try using substitutions and division. Substituting Mark's time at the theater in hours into our equation will allow us to do this more easily.\n5- When writing our equation, we must include both the duration and price of the ticket. This is because we want to be able to calculate Mark's total cost.\n6- Finally, we can use substitution to easily calculate Mark's total spending during 6 weeks. First, we can calculate Mark's time at $5 per hour, which is equal to $15 per trip. Next, we can substitute this value into our statement about Mark's time per week, which is 12 minutes per trip. Here, we can substitute the known variables of Mark's total spends during 6 weeks at $15 per ride and Mark's total time at $15 per week to write our equation as:\nM = (15/6) + (15*12)\nM = 300 + 1200 (where M = Mark's total spots from 6 weeks)\nM = $1500.00\nNote that the question is: how much will Mark spend on a visit to the theater in six weeks?

We do not know the exact number of coffees Jon bought in March but we know they were at least 2 because he buys them every day.\n2. To find the number of coffees he bought in March, we apply this equation twice and get: April is 1 month less than March. This is why we multiply that number times 2. For example: if March was 20 days, we know that April was how many less? We just multiply that by 2:  that's 20 * 2 = 40 in April.\n3. This equation can be used for the total number of coffees he buys for a month: total number of coffees * number_of_months = total_amount_of_spent In this equation, the number of coffee shop are days, and the coffees he buys total cost. The sum of 2 * months gives the total cost of the coffee, and we substract that from the total cost.\n4. Let the number of coffees be x. we multiply this by 2 to get: number_of_cofee * x_days. Then in the number of coffees, we replace it by 2 because we are substracting the cost. Substract number_of_days from total_moneey spent and use 2 to complete the equation.\n5. This equation is x * 2 * number_of_days - 2 * total_money_spnt. Let's solve this for x: x = (2 * number_of days) - 2 * number_amount_spnt.\n6. This is how the answer is calculated: 40*(2*10) -2 * (200) = 0, we could also solve for 2 * 10 and 200, finding 20*(10 - 2) = 200.\n7. We will multiply for simplicity: x = 2*(2*10)-2*200=20*(25)-400=20*20=400. For simplicity of calculation, the number 10 is repeated for 5 times and is therefore 25", "answer": " 120"}

Wendy currently has 4 chickens, which were brought home by Wendy in the first place, so she cannot have more at the same time. At the same time, how many chickers does Wendy have now after adding on at 13 chickens? Does it double the number of chicken? If it is still 4, then how does 13 chicken double to 4 chicken? That means there is nothing between 4 and 13.\n\n2.Now what if we add the 12 chicken? We get 2, so the 2 chickens must be more than 4, and it must be more than 13, as 2 cannot be 13. So 12 chickens are after 4 chicken, then the 4 chicken must be the first one, so it is only 4, which can not be true.\nNow that we can rule out anything greater than 4, let's assume it is only 4. If the 4th chicken is the last one, then 13 - 4 = 9, and nothing is between 4 and 9, therefore this cannot be the solution, as nothing between this range can be true.\n\nBesides, we are not even sure that it is 4. It can also be 15. So we get the only solution is 15.\n\n####  Input: A factory is about to produce its 10000th tire.

The time the grill ran will need to be the sum of the times it burned fifteen coals to ash but it will be less because we do not need to burn the same fifteen coals again. That is, sum of fifteen coals * (T), where T is total time it run.\n3. We need to find fifteen coals and the amount of time that it burns those fifteen coals.\n4. Here, we have to convert units. 60 coals are equal to 4.8 pounds and five minutes is equal to.0083 hour.\n5. After converting units and converting to decimals, the equation is 4.8 * 17 / 5 / 60, which equals (7.16 * 17) / 300, which can simplify further to 1161 / 300. Thus the simplified equation of time is 3.838.\n6. Therefore, we are saying that we need to calculate 3.83 hours to burn the 15 coals and multiply by 15.\n7.

{"text": "There is an easy trick to solving this question, which is :\nWe know that $80, the total amount of sales for the day, can be given as $80(100%)= $80\nNow there will be two types of sales, namely cash sales and credit sales. For each cash sale we can say $80(2/5)= $24\nNow since there were 2/5 cash sales, we deduce that for every 5 credit sales, there would be 2 cash sales giving us $100=$16(5/1)=$100(2/1)= $20 for every credit sale. In short, there would be $20 for each credit sale.\nSo we see that $20 in value represents a credit sale.\n\nNow, the credit sales being $2/5 of the sales, gives $20*2/5 of the credit sales\n= $5(100%)$5\n= $5(2/5)$2\n= 1 dollar \n\nSo the answer is $1\n\nInput: The buyers who came to The shop yesterday bought goods worth  $5. If the 5% were credit sales, and 95% were cash sales, How much did The buyers from The shop make in cash sales?\n\nOutput: Just like the example above, we again note that the final sales revenue cannot exceed $5, which means there cannot be any negative values to the sums being added up.\n\nNow 5% = 5/(100%)=0.05\nWe now note that the 95% = 100% -5% = 1-(0.05)%\n\nNow using the 5% we know $5(0.05) = $0.25 \nNow to get the value for 1-(0.25) we can replace the 0.25 with 0\n\nTo solve this we first multiply 0  with 1. By the product rule this will give us (-1).\nThen taking the negative sign out of the square root operation, we can calculate:\n$-(1/2)^(1/10)=(-1)$\n\nSo the solution for 1-(0,25) = $-1$\n\nNow", "answer": " 48"}

Since the total cost of creating a single movie is $2000, the total cost of making 500 moves will be equal to $100000. This can be calculated by adding 500x6, which equals $30000 and then adding 500 to $2000 to get $1000,000. 2.5 x $1000 = 2500 2500 x 5 = 125000 500 + 1250 = 1750 which gets you $175000 3.

{"text": "So we are first trying to understand the context of this question. We are looking at two different subdivisions and they have similarities in their distribution of houses based on a common factor (one house for each subdivision). We also know the average number of tricks collected per house in each subdivision.

To help arrive at Billy's 'candy amount', we plug this information into a formula first: 25 houses * Billy's rate = 250 tricks. In order to do this, we must convert Billy's number of tricks to a fraction first since it is a non-integer value. This gives us a fraction 11/14 times Billy's total number of tricks = 67%.\nBilly's total number of trick: Number of houses * 67% = 72.5\nTo calculate how many more tricks Anna collects, we will plug this value into the formula above to find the final quantity Anna collects:\n25 \u2013 candy amount = 90 \u2013 25 + 72.5 [Using our formula] = 10.5\nTherefore the final answer, Anna collects 10.5 pieces more than Billy did in this trick-or-treat scenario!\nSo we end up getting:\n72.5 tricks/90 = 0.8 tricks, So 72.5 * 0.8 = 57.875 pieces", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "Answer: 1. We are given the dimensions of two rectangles: 4 ft by 6 ft and 2 ft by 4 ft.\n2. We are given a bolt of fabric that is 16 ft by 12 ft.\n3. The goal is to determine how much fabric in square feet is left.\n4. We can apply the following equation to solve for the remaining fabric in square feet: Remaining fabric = Length (of the fabric) x Width (of the fabric) \u2013 Length (of the rectangles) x Width (of rectangles)\n5. Substituting our values: Remaining fabric = 16ft x 12ft \u2013 (4ft x 6ft) x (2ft x 4ft)\n6. Expanding out the addition and using the laws of exponents: Remaining fabric = (16ft x 2ft) \u2013 (8ft x 4ft x 2ft x 1)\n7. Factoring out 4: Remaining fabric = - 4 (16ft x -1) =- 64 ft\n8. Cancelling out the 4: Remaining Fabric = - 64 \u2013 4.\n9. Subtracting 4 from each side: Remaining Fabric: 50 ft \n10.

What makes this answer wrong is, going up 3 flights and then going down the stairs of the opposite floor, means she ends up walking up the stairs more than 3 times, so this means that 3 can't be 4 and she does walk more than 6 times.\n\n5. Finally, we come to choice E: 3, which is the correct answer.

{"text": "15 is the number below the surface.\nReason:  1. Let's see the question in detail. Toby is counting goldfish but there are 25% (1/4th) that are at the surface and 75% (3/4th) are too deep to be seen.\n2. Here, out of 15 goldfish 15% (1% of 15 goldfisih) is at surface and 85% (85% of 15) is below surface.\n3. The 15 goldfish above are from (85% of (15% of 1, 15 goldfish)) (15%) and below are from (75% of (25% of 1, 15 goldfish)).\n4. So the total goldfish below is 25 goldfish (85% of surface goldfish less 75% of surface goldfisih).\n5. As the answer of 15 gold fishes is correct, we can find total goldfish below is more than 15.

In finance terms it is an investment. This means you have to put in money to earn interest money and profit for the company. The profit is the difference between what you invest and how much you make.\n\nIn this case, the $0.00 is the investment, because you put in $6000.0, but that is no big deal.\n\nFor example, if you have a savings account with a bank, the banks is going to keep this money for a period a time, and you earn interest, which you don't get right away.\n\nIf you take the interest before you get back your investment, you call this a gain because you made money. After the $6000 the investment, you will make money based on your interest.\n\nSo the $600 is a gain of interest. The $6000 is the total investment. If you have a loss, it is a loss of interest if it is a long term gain.\n\nAfter $6000 and $600, there is the profit of $3000 left for you to work with by earning this amount of interest. Once you have earned the $3000, and break even, means your investment is all back in capital or money that you can invest again.\n\nThere are two different types of loan rates and interest and time value of money.

{"text": "1. The first step to solving this problem is to consider the different variables in the equation. Jessica is paying $1000 per month for rent, $230 for food and $120 for car insurance.\n2. The goal, it is to calculate the total amount Jessica is paying each month. This helps us determine the total amount by the end of the year.\n3. To determine the cost for the whole year, we need to multiply each expense by 12 months, as this represents a year's expenses.\n4. We can then use the basic equation of (n-term X M-term) + (n+1-term X M-Term), where n-term represents last year's expenses and n+1-term represents this year's expenses, and M-term represents how many times the expenses will occur per year.\n5. Thus our equation becomes ((30% X 1000 X 12) + ((50% X 230 X 12)+(150% X 120 X 12)), for a total of $4240 more dollars over the course of a year, or a monthly increase of $12 per month.\nSo the final equation is given as follows: total = ((30% X $1000 X $12) + ((30% X Food + $120 X $12)+ (150% X $120 X (12)) = $ 1240 per year, or $103.33 more per month over last year.

There is one question which is, how much peanuts does he buy and there is one question which is how much peanuts he eats. It is asking about daily consumption of some.\n2) He has $4 in change and so he buys 12 pounds because 4*3=12, which would be his bill\n \n3) Frank buys peanuts all in the week so there remaining amount is $4-12= -8 after buying 12 pounds and so he has 18 pounds after spending his $4-12=$8 to buy 12 pounds.\n Now Frank has two ways to eat, he can eat 1 or 2 peanuts every day, in case he eats 2 peanuts, he can eat 9 peanuts in a week and in case he eats one peanut he can have 18 peanuts in a whole week.\n So he eats 18 peanut every day.\n\n1) Question: How do you determine amount of peanuts he bought and how he bought.\n2) In the case, when he eats 1 peanut we can say that he has 2$ left so he can buy 6 pounds, but when he eats 2 he can buy 4.5 so in case he is eating 2 every day we have to divide $4 by 8 (day and hour) so we can make calculation.\n3) So we can say that he is not in the position to finish the whole amount since there is no way for him.

The best way to answer a question like this is to look for synonyms of the two words \"clear\" and \"pleasant\".\n    A clear day suggests that the weather is good, it is sunny, and probably you can see a long way into the distance.\n    A pleasant day is less literal. It could mean anything from calm wind, no rain, perfect temperatures, etc. However, there is a slight connotation in pleasant that hints of the temperature or wind not being so good. In summary, \"clear\" implies good weather whereas \"pleasant\" may not be so good.\n    The two words are related, and can be interchanged with each other as is evident in the following sentence.\n        A clear day can be quite unpleasant if the sun is hot, and the wind is cold and the sky is dark.\n        The sun is bright and hot, and the wind feels cold, the sky is dark, but the weather is not pleasant at all, it's quite clear.\n       Here, weather is not pleasant, as one can see a long way down the road (clear), but it is still quite unpleasant (bad weather).\n    Thus, \"pleasant\" is the better word to use.\n2) We are given a sentence of the form \"The weather is (adjective), it (verb)....\".\n    We should always answer with the adjective that appears earlier in the sentence.", "answer": " 7"}

She gets 4 for morning and 4 for bed, total 8 for day. For 6 days it will be: 4 x 6=24 cookies(we just round up to 25 cookies in this case to avoid being 3 for 1 day, the box will never have less than 25 cookies because Basil gets 2 for both days)\n4)We also know that she gets 4 for each day, and 5 days a week, so the total number of cookies for 5 days is 20 (total 5*4=20 cookies)\n5)Now that we know all the given information, we can go to step 2) and start subtracting\nFor example, we can subtract 3 times of what she already got for 2 days since that's the total she's been given for 2 days.

If we divide 30 cookies with 18 we will get : 30 \u00f7 18 = 1.77777\n7)Since we don't have a perfect answer in fractions, we can convert to a decimal. 1.77 = 17 / 9.5 = 17 \u00f7 9.5 So the final answer is 17777/950 = 18.7 boxes\nSo this is how we answer this question.

{"text": "First, we need to understand the data that is given to us. There are 44 cows, 50% of them are female and 50% of the female cows are pregnant. Based on this information, we can make the following observations:\n1. Out of 44 cows only 22 of them are female.\n2. Out of the 22 female cows, half of them (11 cows) are pregnant.\n3. So instead of calculating the number of all female cows to find out the number of pregnant female crows, we could subtract the number of female cows from the total number of cows to get the number of male cows. From the total number of crows (44), 22 cows are female and 22 cows female, so the original total is reduced by 44. The difference of 22 and 44 will give us the number of male crows, which is 22.\n4. Now we have to determine whether 22 of the 22 crows are pregnant or not and use the condition of 50 precent of female crows being pregnant, to decide which among the 22 females are pregnant crows. 11 of the 22 are pregnant cows.\n5.

{"text": "3. A quick way to solve this question is to draw up a table where the columns represent the two days and the rows represent the number of songs. This makes it easier to keep track of the number of songs Jeremy listened to across the two days.\n4. On the first day, he listened to 9 songs. On the second day, he listened to fewer songs than he did on the first day, meaning he listened to five fewer songs in total. Since he didn't listen to any songs at all on the second day, we can safely say that there will be no zeroes in the table.\n5. To work out how many songs he listened to in total, we can simply add up the number of songs in each column. We know that he listened to 9 on the first day so the first day column will have 9 as its value. For the second day, we know we subtracted five, so there will 4 in that column. Summing up the two columns gives us a total of 13 songs for the two days. Thus the answer is 13.\nSo the final solution is B: 13", "answer": " 23"}

All this can be boiled down to 43 = 5A3 + 4A. So you should get the answer (43 \u2013 32) A = 9 and (43 \u2013 28)A=15. Hence the number of grandchildren Max has = 15.\nSo the final solution is:\nC: (5x8)+32=43\n28: (4x8)+32 =43\n15: (5x8)-28=43\n9: (4x8)-43=43\n\n# Code to run:\ninput = \"apparatus\"\noutput = \"max\"\nif output!='max':\n\toutput = apparatus\n\n\n# Code to Run: Enter your code here.

{"text": "1. The first step would be to read the question carefully and to clarify the task at hand. In this question we are presented with several pieces of data about Kenny's week: he played 10 hours, ran 2 hours, and practiced 2 hours on the trumpet.\n2. The second step would be to identify the relationship between each of these pieces of data, in this case, we can observe that if Kenny played for 10 hours, he had to run twice as long as he had spent on basketball and he had to practice on the trumpets twice as long as he did on running.\n3. The next step would be to use this information to determine how long Kenny practiced on the trummpets, because if we follow the relationships that were established in the two previous steps, it is clear that he practiced for 2+2=4 hours.\n4. The final step would be to verify our solution. To do this we can plug in values for each of the variables in the question (Kenny ran and played for a total of 4 hours, he practiced for 4 hours, so we ask Kenny played 10+4+4=18 hours) to see that indeed the solution produced by our algorithm is correct, as he spent 18 hours practicing on the trumpet and 4 hours practicing other instruments.\n\nHence the final answer will be:B: 4 hours\n\n***\n\n### Your submissions\nInstructions:Enter any 3 test cases into 3 different cells. \n\nThe number of test cases exceeding given for submission must be zero.\n\nSolution and test data: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LwuYM65L4Ut6nEZ8LG9Lm69zQYQ6GDQZ2K-1HQX6HnY/edit?usp=sharing\n\n### Your feedback\nInstructions:Feedback will be provided in the comments section\n\n### The right answer to every question\n\n\n### Test 1\n\nOutput:A: c.

Half of $1956 = $978, so Salvadore earns $978 while Santo also earns the other half of $978 = $489.\nStep 2: Formulate an equation.We can formulate an equation from the given information:\n\n$1956\\cdot \\frac 12= 978$ (Salvadore\u2019s salary)\n\nWe can then combine the two salaries since saving is a part of Santo\u2019s total salary and we know the combined salaries together:\n\n((1956\\div 2) \\cdot\\frac 12+ 393)\\div 2 = 1956\\times\\frac 12 = 978$\n\nStep 3: Solve with the correct operator! In a math word problem like this one, the goal is to solve by plugging the problem into the problem-solving process.We need to solve for a unknown variable and get $1,956 + \\frac{1}{2}393 - (1956\\dfrac{1}{393}+\\dfrac{1}{1956}) -2 = 2$.\nSo, the total salary of the two men is $1956+1480-2=3 444$\n\nAnswer: Input: Salvadore earned $978. Santo earned half of Salvadore\u2019s salery. How much salary does Santo earn?\nOutput: 2. First of all, we should notice the word \"salary\", which is a noun as we can see it's referring to the total amount a person earns.\n\nWe also know the part of it goes to Salavado, the rest is for Santo.\n\nNow, let's see the 4 options that we are to chose from the given.\n\nA.

{"text": "1. To solve this problem, we must first determine how long it takes to read each book.\n\n2. We can see that we need to read an equal amount of pages each day to finish both books in two weeks.\n3. So in order to complete both books in two weeks, we must finish one book in 2 weeks divided by 180 pages, which is 2 pages a day.\n4. The next book is 10 pages shorter, so it will take 2 pages a day to finish the first book, and then an extra 2 pages a day for the second book to finish it completely within two weeks.\n5. The total pages read each day is therefore 4 pages.\n6. Hence, the answer is Option B - 4 pages.\n\nInput: You are to write me a long and informal e-mail in which you complain about the teacher and the lectures. You are at the end of the year. The topic of the topic is 'The teacher and me'.\nOutput:1. For this email, we can use informal language and tone.\n\n2. It would be appropriate to write about how the teacher hasn't been helpful and how their lectures haven't been useful.\n3. We can express our feelings and thoughts about how the teacher has behaved badly and how their lectures have been a waste of time.\n4. Option B: Long And Informal seems like a possible answer because it includes both 'long' and 'informal' in the email I should write.\n5. The topic of the given email is actually 'The Teacher And Me', so Option A: The Teacher And I is not relevant.\n6. The teacher's lectures have caused us to suffer, so option D: The teacher's lecturers have caused us to suffer is a possibility, but it is not grammatically correct.\n7. The teacher has been difficult to deal with, so option E: The teacher is difficult to deal with is an appropriate option and the right grammar.\n8. The sentence about how their lectures have caused us a lot of suffering may change to 'The teacher's lectures and she has caused us to suffer a lot'.\n9. However,'she' should be'me' due to the pronoun 'I'. So the final sentence would read: The teacher's lecture and I have suffered a lot.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "1.This is an arithmetic question and, when solving any arithmetic questions, the steps to perform are first identify the unknowns, subtract the known value from the total value to come up with a more manageable number and repeat this until the unknowns become zero or the value of the unknowns become trivial.\n2. In this question, we have three expenses to be met. If we find an equation to represent the relationship between the expenses, then we can make the calculation. The budget for food and water is $240(160 * 160) and the budget for phone bills and house rent, 160 and 40 respectively.\n3. We note that the total budget of food and phone expenses is greater than the amount of rent Luna pays and since the budget of food and phone is 60% greater than the amount of the rent, the food expense is $160 and the remaining $80 is phone bill.\n4. As mentioned before, we can start by subtracting the amount of rent which is 40 from the total expense and the difference is now food expense which is 160.\n5. To arrive at the phone bill, we subtract the remaining amount ($80) from the food expense ($160). So, the phone bill is $80.\n6. So, our equation is :\n\nThe food expense is $800, so $800 x 10% = $80 \n\nThe phone bill is $840, so $840 x 16% = $137.6 \n\nThe phone expenses are $237.6\n\nNow we know that she can afford a total budget of $237.\n\n7.

The first step in solving this question is to clearly understand the context of the question. The question states that Anthony and Leonel both decided to adopt cats and dogs from a local rescue center.\n2. Furthermore, the question also states that Anthony has 12+ cats and dogs while Leonel has fewer cats but more dogs than Anthony. This gives us some information to work with and gives us a good idea of the relationship between the two.\n3. The next step is to create a list of the animals that both Leonel and Anthony have. For Anthony, we can list down the cats first and then the dogs. We also need to include how many animals each person has.\n4. For Leonel, we can also list his animals down first, but we need to include the number of pets he has, which is 1/2 as many cats as he has dogs. We can write the equations this way: Cats=Anthony-Dogs and Dogs=Leonel-1/2 Cats.\n5. When given a relation such as Cats = Anthony - Dogs, we need to convert this into algebra in order to find the values related to the equations. Therefore, we can write this as Cats = Anthons - Dogs = (Anthoney - Dogs) - Dogs = (2Dogs + Dogs) - D = 3Dogs\n6. Then, when we apply the same logic to Leonel's relationships, we can write Dogs = Leonels - 1/2Cats = Leonels - (12-Cats). This equation can then be simplified to Dogs = Leonels*6-Cats = 13*6-Cats.\n7. To solve for Leonel, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by Cats to get Leonels = Annotny - Dogs*13+Cats. Then, we need to add 13 to both sides of the equation to take the Cats out, giving us Leonels = Anthonys - Dogs+13, and then we can subtract 13 from", "answer": " 27"}

We identify the key quantities: the initial leakage from each of the holes, their size and duration.\n\n3. We can use these quantities and the given information to find the amount of leakage from the three holes.  There are many ways to approach this question, but a useful method to find the total water leaked is to assume a constant rate, and then use integration to find the amount of water over a given time interval.\n4. Integral: [image](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iEoXp.png)\n\n4. Let's go in depth in each part of this equation\n5. Let x = duration of time, x2 = the area of triangle ABC in days, B = height of the triangle ABC and B2 = side B, so the area of ABC = one third the area of the triangle ABC.\n6. Thus, x2 = (1/2)*3  + (1/2)*x = (9/2)*x\n7. Then if x = 2 units, x2 = (9/2)2 so x2 = 72.\n8. Thus, x2=72, x = 7, so x = 7.\n\n9.

B:A box of cookies is not surprising! \nC:A girl's eyes are as lovely as flowers! D:A box of cookies, eh?\nE:No, thanks. I have a box of my own.\nOutput: 1: A: is incorrect as the use of the word 'was' makes the sentence confusing. In other words, the sentence is saying that the box that I bought (present tense, which is not correct) is so small ('was so small'). This is not the correct choice.\n2. B: The sentence structure is awkward, as the use of the present tense 'are' (would be correct if the sentence was 'A box of cookies is surprising!') is followed up by 'was so small' (past tense), which is incorrect usage. In addition, the choice does not convey the correct meaning either. So B is incorrect.\n3. C is incorrect as the word 'love'.ly' does not fit the context and is a grammar error.\n4. D is incorrect as it is a mix of past and present tense and also does not agree grammatically with the previous choice.\n5.

{"text": "2. The first step is determining the number of bananas that each of the girls has. If we were to use the first sentence, it is clear that Lydia has one fewer bananas than Dawn, while Donna has 40 fewer bananas than DaWN.\n3. We can fill in the blank in the second sentence by knowing which of the three girls have 60 bananas. Since this is the blank, it indicates that one of the girls has 60 banana. We know that Dawn and Lydia each have 200 banansa, while Donna has only 40 bananas, making Donna the girl who has 60 banasna.\n4. Knowing that Donna has 60 banansa, we can use the above information to fill in the blank in tthe third sentence. This time, we can determine the number of bananas Dawn and Lydu each have by adding her number of bananas to the bananas Dawn already has. After doing this, we have (40+40)=80; and (60+80)=120. Adding 100 to 200, we get 300 bananas; thus, Dawn and Lydian each have 100 bananas each. Donna has 65 bananas.\n5. To add to the contextual understanding, we know that Lydia has 15 more banansa then Donna, while Dawn has 70 bananas more than Lydia.", "answer": " 40"}

In this example, the verb phrase \"he is paid to...\" indicates that a verb will follow.\n2) Next, we examine the verbs that are possible in context. If none are plausible choices, we then eliminate the rest of the words in the sentence.\n3) In this case, the possibilities include, \"walk\", \"work\", \"earn\", \"pay\" because they all modify the phrase \"he is paid\". \"pay\" is already the correct answer given that it is the intended verb.\n4) For a multiple choice question, the answer is given if several choices are not valid. In this case, two choices were correct: \"work\" and \"earn\". \"Work\" was the obvious choice since it had already been used in the sentence.

According to the question, she wants to decorate half the cupcakes with one candle each and the rest with two. Adding up 1 + 2 and dividing it by 2 we determine that there are 12 cupcakes.\n3. From here, we determine how many candles Stephanie needs to decorate each cupcake with. If we assign one number to each candle on the cupcake, we can see that 12 candles equal half a dozen, and 24 candles equal four dozen.\n4. In order to find out how many candles Stephany needs to use, we simply need to subtract the total candles she already has from the number of candles required to complete each cupcake (16).\n5. This is how it works: 96 \u2013 30 = 66, and since Stephany needs 4 dozen candles for each 12 cupcaks, she needs an additional 4 dozen candles. 66 divided by 4 gives us 16. Stephany needs to decorate one and a half dozen candles per cupcake (or sixteen), adding an extra sixteen candles to her total.\n\n6. So the final answer is 16: the number of extra candles Stephany needs.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Answer: 2. First, we start by identifying the main clause of the sentence, which is \"John eats a bag... for dinner\". The main clause includes an action verb (\"eats\") and a direct object (\"bag of chips\").\nNow, let's look at the context of the sentence and see if it contains any numbers or mathematical operations. The sentence says that \"John eats a bad of chips for dinner\". This can only mean that he eats a single bag of chips for his dinner, which also means he is not going to eat the amount again that he just ate.\n\nIf John eats again after finishing his dinner, he will not continue eating the same number of chips. So, John will have to start over with a new bag of chips. The sentence says he ate the same amount again after dinner and not he ate twice as many. If he ate twice as the amount again he would have eaten three times as many as he did in first bag of chips before the dinner. Hence, if John ate twice as many, he ate a total of four bags of chips.

{"text": "The most important step in this problem is to understand exactly how the plane's fuel consumption works. First, we know that the plane needs 20 * miles to get the empty plane to travel 1 mile. This can be written as 20. Then, for every extra person there is on the plane, it will increase the plane's consumption by 2 gallons. This is 0.002 gallons per mile, which will be written as 10^-3. This also means, though, that the addition of 0.003 gallons per mile from each bag is smaller than the addition of passengers, so we'll put this in 310^-3.\nNext, the only thing left is the total. We multiply all the fuel additions together, and then get 2 for the empty plane. The full fuel amount is 2 + 40.003 + 310.003 = 4.19.\nSo, the output should be 4.20.\n\nInput:Gary lives in a house where he uses 120 kWh of electricity each month.

The first step is as always to define any variables used. So, the variable for electricity use is \"daily_kwh\", for the number of hours it takes to heat the house \"hours_used\", and the variable for energy consumption per hour \"energy_level\".\nThe next step is to identify how much electricity is needed for each part, using the formula \"kwh_needed = kwh_per_consumption / energy_level\". Now, \"daily_kWh\" should be calculated using the formula \"daily_kW = kwh * hours_used\". If we use 80% efficiency, then the formula for energy consumption per hour would be \"energy_level * 1.2\"\nNow, we plug in the numbers.\nDaily_kW \u2248 kwh * hours", "answer": " 106000"}
{"text": "Answer : The input question involves finding the combined height of two rockets.  The answer lies in the comparison of two values, which is a crucial step in logical reasoning.  To determine the combined height of the rockets, we need to compare the heights of the two rockets and find the difference between the two.  To do this, we use the formula that is provided in the question.  The formula states that we need to multiply the base height of the first rocket by the total height divided by 2, and the base height of the second rocket by 2.  To do this computation, we will first find the base heights of the two rocket models and then use this height difference to compute the combined height.  The formula requires that we find the difference in the base heights of model 1 and model 2, then we find the difference or height of model 2 and the height of model 2 doubled, adding these two together finds the total combined height. \nSo the final answer to the question 500*(2/(2x2)) \n\nInput: There are 15 ounces in 2 cups and 3 pounds in 20 cups.

This means that if there were 100 vehicles on the driveway, there were also 200 parked behind them. The only way for this to be true is if the driveway had to have been so wide that they were able to park half of the vehicles on the front of the lot and the other half at the back.\n3)If there had been only 100 vehicles total on the lot, there could only have been 50 cars parked at the back.

This means if the cars packed in front were empty and the cars in the back were full, as fewer cars parked in front than in the back, it adds up to an empty space at the front and a space with more than 100 cars.\n5)As the question states, \"the total number of cars at a end of the play was seven hundred.\" This means there were more than fifty cars parked at the front of the lot as they were not packed more than cars in the back.\n6)As the total number of cars on the lot was a hundred more than the number before the play, there must have been a hundred more cars packed into back.\nSo this brings the answer to question C.

Thus the formula is 20+20+20 so 60 total people are attending the party.\nThen subtract step: We subtract 20 from the total number of people 60 so we get 40 people in the party excluding Ashley because 20 people had a total of 20 people at the party including everyone.\nNow we move on to step 3\nStep 3: We use the same formula as step 1 because we want to answer how much of the total people are invite 20 people.\nStep 4: Use the formula again for the step 3.\nStep 5(Final value): When you do the calculations that we did in the earlier steps, you get 40 in the numerator.\nStep 6: Finally, we have to find which one is the larger quantity of this 40 or the one on the denominator i.e. 120.\nStep 7: The correct answer is 40 and the reason for it is that 20(the number of people who initially attended) multiplied by 2 times of invitees which is 40.\nSo the Final answer after we finished all the step is the 40:120.\nSo the final value 40:100.\n\nIf the numbers you're trying to multiply exceeded nine digits in size, you can use the \"mixed number\" syntax of C#'s Math.Pow() method instead.\nA value of -1, 0, or 1 is the multiplicative inverse of that value.\nInput: -19.83840864708550371110354337 *", "answer": " 31"}

{"text": "1. This answer is based on the following mathematical formula:  Number of Free Throws = (Hit Rate * Lanes hit)* Foul per game.  Here, 70% * 4 lanes is 2.8 lanes per game, 5 games X 2.8 laners per game is 14 lanes.  So, the formula would be:  Number of Free throws = 14 lanes \n2. To use the formula, the following steps can be taken:\nDetermine the hit rate:  The hit rate is the percentage of free throws that John hits. It was given that he hits 70%of his free throws.  Hence the hit rate is 0.7.\nDetermine the number of free throws per game:  The formula used for this is 70% * (4 lanes)* 5 foul per game, which gives 2.8 laner per game.\nDetermine foul per game: The foul per game is the percentage of laners that John fouls in a game. It was given that John gets fouled 5times per game. Hence the foul per game is 5.\nDetermine number of laners John hits in a game: The foul percentage is equal to 70% * laners pergame, which is equal to 5.  So, John hits 5 laners per game, when he plays for 20 games. \n3. Using the above formula, the number of free throws in the game are calculated as: 2.8 lanars per game * 80% = 2 lanes.

{"text": "1) Given the information provided, we can infer that Betty is approximately 1-1/2 feet tall, or about 18\". This was calculated by using the rule that: if Carter is 2 times as tall as his dog, then Betty should be 1/2 as tall as Carter, or ~ 12\".\n2) To answer the question, we must solve for one of the unknowns. Betty's height is the unknown. To solve, we need to simplify our givens and find a rule that relates to the unknown. We use the first equation to obtain the value for Carter, then use the second equation to obtain the value of Betty.\n3) To do calculations, we must first convert the given units to inches. According to the given information, Carter is twice as tall as Betts. We know that 12\" is equal to 1 foot, so in order to convert both heights to inches, we multiply the units by 2.\n4) Solving, we can find that Carter is 47\" tall. We now use this formula to calculate Betts' height. We know that Carter is twice as tall Betts, and we know that 12 inches is equal to 1 feet. By substituting 12 for 2, we can easily calculate Betts' height in centimeters. Betts' height is approximately 36.72cm.\n5) This answer was obtained by manipulating the equations into the equation for Betty's height. We used the relationship between feet and centimeters to calculate Betts height in centimeters: 3 feet is equal to 36 inches.  One foot is equal to 12 inches.  We can say that Betty is 0.14 feet taller than Carter. Betty's height in centimeters is approximately 36 + (0.14 feet) = 36.86 cm.\n6) Therefore, the final answer is:  Betty's height in ft is 1 foot and 9 in. or 36.71cm.", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "1) The first step is to review the question. We can see that Mr. Benson bought multiple tickets, receiving a discount for each additional ticket he bought. The question does not specify the total number of tickets sold or the total discount rate, which means that we need to calculate these values given the information provided.\n2) To calculate the total number of tickles sold, we need to use multiplication and division. We first multiply the number of tickets by the individual cost of a ticket to get the total cost of one ticket. We also need to divide the total cost by $40, which is the price of a ticket, to get the total number of tickes in the purchase:\n$40 / 40 = 12\n\n3) We can use a similar process to determine how much Mr. Benson paid for each additional ticket. We take the total cost of one item, $40, and subtract the cost of 10 tickets, which is 12 tickets multiplied by $40, to get the total discount for the additional 2 tickets bought. The cost of each additional ticket is $40 x 0.9, or $36, therefore:\n\n$40 x 12 = 480\n$40 x (12 + 2) = 560\n\n4) Finally, we can use this information to determine the total cost Mr. Benson paid.

In this case, the sub-question 1 asks, \"What did George buy?\". This question asked is about the juice and sandwich, not the milk, so you can eliminate choices D and D. You can also eliminate A because George could have bought a large, small, medium, or extra-large sandwich. The sandwich could also have cost $0 (if George did not buy it). In addition, there is no reason to believe that George would have bought only one bottle of juice or milk (in fact, George could have bought several drinks in each case) so C and B can be eliminated as well. Finally, you can eliminate choices E and F, because the sandwich cost $6", "answer": " 21"}

Choice:  A: line B: graph C: function D: set E: ratio\nOutput: 1)(The equation is the symbol representing something called a function of two variables. In an equation, the variables are the letters x and y and the function is what the letters represent. The letters indicate some sort of value, like the amount of money in your bank account for x or the height of a person in inches for y, etc. The function tells us what that value is.)\n2) Now we have to find out what each variable stands for in the 2x + 5 = \u20131 function. For this, there\u2019s generally one basic method, which involves using the substitution method of different values for the variables. This allows you to determine what the symbols mean in the equation and what it\u2019s saying. Remember that you\u2019re changing only the variable(s) to make calculations easier. The variable that the equation refers to, like x for instance, will not be altered. It will always stand for money in your bank account. \n3) Now let\u2019s look at this equation 2x +4 = -1 \nWhen we put in values like 2 or 4 in x, that makes the function 2x +4 or -1. This changes the function to look like this in the new equation 2x and -4 are equal to -1. You\u2019ll find the value of x that is equal to -1 if you solve for x. For example, if 2x + 0 = -1 \n, you could solve for 2x by subtracting 0 on each side, which will leave you 2x = -1, so x = -1/2. 4) You can now substitute any value for x into the original equation 2x +0; thus you can test all of the possibilities. \n\nInput : You are driving your car and the odometer just read 42,231 miles.

How many students in the class have no younger siblings?\nOutput: This is quite a difficult problem. However, there is an incredible shortcut you can use to simplify it to a matter of deduction.\n\nBy definition, we can eliminate anyone who has a younger sister, since there are only 4 people in the class who have a younger sibling at all. So we can eliminate them from the problem completely.

Next, we can find out the speed for this day by multiplying 16 by 3600 (3600 seconds or 60 minutes in an hour). This will be the total distance covered for the first day. Similarly, for the second day, we calculate the total distance covered by multiplying the 16 by 4800 (4800 second in120 minutes).

If Angie drinks 40 cups per pound so it means that after getting 12 lbs of coffee it will serve how many number of days? Choice: A: 39 days B: 38 days C: 41 days D: 37 days E: 36 days\nOutput:1. We can eliminate choices B and D. After getting 12 lb of coffee it will take how many days? So we can eliminate choices B and C.\n2. Now we can calculate how many number of days it will take to get the next 12 lbs. If we multiply 40 cups to 12, then we get 480 cups. So we have to divide 3 by 480, we get 8.33.\n3. It will take a number of days to get 12 lbs, So we divide this number with 8.33, that is 8.33-12, so we get 3.7 - 12, it means 8.33 days, So we have our answer, our answer is 8.3 days.

Baking bread means you have to let it dry until it is done. The process can be summarized by the equation:\nd + c = 46 where [d] means dough and [c] means cook.\n2. How long a bread will take you to bake, depends on the dough it is cooked with. For example, each kilogram of dough bakes a different amount of time than another. But it is also true that the kilogram of dough you are cooking for each minute is different from some other bread.\n3.

In this scenario, the amount is $45.40, so we will round down to $45.\n2. Next, we need to know how much is in each type of coin. We can convert $20 into the coin values, e.g., (20 * 0.10) * 10 = $2\n3. Now that each type of coin has been converted into the amount, we can figure out how many cents total there should be in the change with the current bills and coins. Using round up, the total amount of cash must be $47, since $20.20 will total $47.20.\n4. We can work backwards from the total in cash to figure out how many quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies will go into each person's change. We know that a quarter is worth 25 cents, so four quarters will be $10.\n5. Next, we need the amount in dimes to get to a quarter, dime, nickels, and then pennies. We multiply $10 by 10 to get $100, and we multiply $100 by 100 to get 1,000 cents, so we have $10 x 10 = 100 cents. We subtract 100 cms from 1000 cms to get our answer of 90 cents = 9 dimes rounded down to 8 dimes.\n6. Next, we need 1 nickel + 1 penny = 1.5, so since we have 8 dimes, we need to add 8 * 1.5 to get 12.5 cents more. That gives us a total of 104 cents, so we add this to the 8 dimes to get 102 cents for the 7 dimes.\n7. To get from 102 cms to 1 cent, we subtract 100 from 102, which gives us 2 cents.

Hence, the total amount of water is 3,000 ml, which is 3 liters.(Reminder: there are 30ml in 1/3 of a litre)\n\nAs there are 2g of charcoal added for each 30ml of water, we can say that the 900ml of water consists of 60 grams of paint.

{"text": "The first step is to read and understand the question carefully. The question asks for the total number of tires on the used car lot's vehicles, taking into account the number of vehicles that have a spare tire.\nThe next step is to break down the question into smaller chunks to facilitate calculation. The number of used cars and motorcycles can be found by subtracting 0.75 (a third of the vehicles) from the total number of vehicles available. The number of tires on spare cars can be found by first calculating the percentage of cars with spares and then multiplying it by the total number of cars in the lot.\nSimilarly, the percentage of motorcycles with spared can be calculated, and then multiplied by the total number of motorcycles available. Lastly, the total number of tars can be found by adding the number of spare tires on cars with spares and the number of tires on unspared motorcycles.\n\nInput:We can use the pythagoras theorem to find the length of the diagonal d of a rectangle. The theorem states that the area of a rectangle is equal to the length of its diagonal. Length is equal to the square root of its area. To find the area of a rectangle, simply square the diagonals b and c. The area of rectangle is equal to b x c. To find the square root of the rectangle we must then divide by c.\nOutput: The formula for diagonal d is d = sqrt((b)2 + (c)2). The next step to find the length of d is to square both sides to get rid of radicals. The length of d will be d = sqrt(((b)2) + ((c)2). The formula for area is A = sqrt(b^2) + sqrt(c^2). To find the area, simply multiply both sides by c. The formula for area of a rectangle is A = (sqrt(b^2) x c). To find the length squared, simply square both sides to rid of radicals. Squaring both sides of the formula of a square we get that d^2 = sqrt((b^2) (c^2). The next step is to find the root of d squared. As always, we just need to get rid of the radicals.

{"text": "1) First, we need to understand the context of this question. The question asks us to find the average time per kilometer that TJ ran. We can assume that TJ ran the race in approximately one hour.\n\n2) We cannot directly calculate the average time per kilometer from the information provided as the length of the race is not specified.\n\n3) With that said, the first half of the race is 20 minutes. We know that there is an implicit assumption that 20 minutes is equivalent to 10 km. Hence, we can conclude that the race is approximately 20 km in length.\n4) To calculate the average time per km from this information, we would divide the total time run, which is 1 hour by the distance run, which is approximately 20km. Hence, the average time per km would be: total time run / total distance run.\n\n5) Finally, we would convert the resulting answer to a fractional form since the question asks for the answer in km/hr. The conversion would be as follows: total time run (/ total distance run) x 1 hr / total distance run, \n\n6) So the answer to this question would be: 2000 meters per hour.

When we rewrote the sentence, we noted that one of the numbers is negative (Kayla), which means it is less than 5, while the other number (Suraya) is positive, which means it is greater than 5. This means that the difference between the first two is -5.\n4. From this we can conclude that the difference between Suraya and Kayla's amount of apples is 5.

We further know that her time spent on laundry is equal to her time spent on homework, which is smaller than her time spent doing either of the other two tasks. We need to determine which task is smaller: cleaning the bathroom or cleaning her room.\n3) Because the total amount of time spent on laundering and cleaning her room is only larger than the total amount of time she spent on cleaning the bathroom by fourty minutes (40), it is safe to suppose that Miriam spent a shorter amount of time on cleaning her room than she did on doing the bathroom.\n4) Finally, if she spent a shorter amount of cleaning her room than doing the bathroom, then we can determine that her time spent cleaning her room is less than her time spent cleaning the bathroom.

{"text": "1. The first step to solving this problem is to understand the terms and phrases in the description of the problem. We know that John receives a bonus that is the same percentage every year, and last year he made $150,000 in total pay, which included his bonus amount of $10,02.\n2. The current year is $220,000, and we are told that John receives the same percentage bonus as in previous years. Based on the information provided, the equation looks like $$Bonus \\cdot \\% + TotalPay $$ where $%$ is the percentage bonus and $TotalPay$ is the total pay.\n3. As a result, the bonus amount for $200,200 is equivalent to $10,0, which is the same as the bonus amount received in the previous year.\n4. In terms of total pay, the total pay for $200+200+ 200 = 600.\n5. The bonus amount this year is the same as the previous year's bonus amount. Therefore, the bonus amount this year is $100K.\n6. The total pay and bonus amount this year is $$Bonus \\ % + Total Pay \\.$ $10,0+ 600. $ 100000 + 600, $101,000.\nSo the correct answer is A: $101k.\n\nInput:A tugboat can tow up to 35 cars on a single float.

To do so, let's look at Kirt's initial salary - $6000.00. We can think of his $6000 salary as being equivalent to taking $666.67 in wages every month.\n3. 30% means that for every $666.70 he's taking home, he's actually making $840.00, or a total of $433.33 per month.\n4. So to find this amount annually, we take $433.60 times 12. Thus, Kirt is making an annual salary of $5200 when our first year rolls over into the second.\n5. Our next step is to determine Kirt's salary after the second year. After all, the second year will add another $300 to his salary.\n6. Thus, Kirt's salaray with our $6000 annual salary is $5200.\n7.

If we subtract m from both sides, we can rewrite this as follows:\n-2x - m = 30 - m.\nSubtracting m from both sides and rearranging the equation results in:\n-2x + m = 30.\nMultiplying both sides by 3 leaves us with:\n-6x + m = 90.\n\nWe now need to find the value of m, given these constraints.\nWe can solve for x = 2 and m = 10.\nSo, we know that Michael started with 30 matchstick houses and each house had 10 matchstick bricks.\nTo complete Michael's original plan, he'll need 30 more matchsticks equaling 40 matchsticks, so he still has 10 matchstitches remaining after completing his plans.\nSo, 30 - 40 = 10 and we'll plug 10 in all over the place to simplify things.\nPlug that into our original equation:\n-2x = 30 - 10, which reduces to -2x = 20 and plugging in 20 = 2x\nWe now know:\n-6x = 40\nWhich we can multiply by -6 to get:\nx = 7\nMichael had 30 matchstitches.\nHe wanted to use 15 matchstiches per house, so he needed 20 houses to be able to complete his plan.\nHe used 30 matchstiches, but still had 10 left over after completing his plan to build 30 houses.\nAnswer: m = 10\n\n### Grading Question:\n### If you are feeling too overwhelmed by this assignment and just want to get any letter, do this assignment and send it to your instructor.

{"text": "Solution:\n\nIn this question we are supposed to find out how many golf balls each person purchased. We first look at the total number of balls purchased by each person. This is given as D=5 doz, G=2 dozand C=48. We also know that each dozen costs $30.\n\nWe now have all of the information we need and can now solve the question.\n\n1. If we look at total cost we see that D=5*30=150 DG=D+G=150+2*30=180 and DC=D-G=150-2*30=50 and CC=48*30=1440 So we can represent all of the costs in a table as follows:\n\n   1.  Total cost $30 for 1 D. and $60for 2D $240for3D $300for4D and $48 for 1 Doz. (12 Balls)Total cost $30 for12  B $240for 1 D. and so on..\n\n2. We now observe that the D column sums up to 150, the G column sums up to 210 and the C column sums up to 740. These are shown as follows: D sums to 150 (5doz), G sums to 210 (2doz) and C sums to 740 (48).\n\n3. For a total of 2140\n\n\n\n\n3. Thus total cost is 2140. We can go a step further from where we are and compare how much Gus pays for each ball. If we take the 10 balls each person bought and multiply them with the price per dozen we get the answers:D pays G gets(210-180)/12=15$G pays D gets(180-210)/12=-3$C pays D gets(150-740)/12=-55$C pays G gets(74-$210)/10$= 50$C pays D gets(-65)/12=-5$C pays G get 74/12*10", "answer": " 132"}

At this point it becomes much clearer what we need to do.

Rodney's remaining amount: $35 + 20 dollars = $55 dollars.Now, let's determine Ian's original amount: Ian has 20 + half of Ian's total amount (= $50 dollars). Rodney has $5 more than half of Ian. Ian has total amount = $50 dollars. Rodney is $5 less than half of Ian'ss total amount. Jessica has a total amount of $100 dollars.

Now that we have determined the probability of a person meeting Jim is Boston is, we can determine the probability of a person (or meeting) being from a city other than 113 Main.\n5.

Therefore, the probability of a person other than Jim meeting Jim is equal to the probability a person is Boston meeting Jim, minus the probability Jim in Boston meeting Jim.\n7. We know each probability is less 1, so we have that probability of a person from another city meeting Jim is: 0.14 - 1 = 0.06 \n8. So, we know that there is a 6% chance that a person from another city random meets Jim.\n9. Therefore, there is 6% chance that the person is from a city other", "answer": " 60"}

The first thing to\n note is the time limit of 30 minutes\n within which Kris and her brother\n want to blow up as many \nballoons as possible. They decide to\n use Kris\u2019 speed of 2 balloons per\nminute, and her brother\u2019s speed of\n 4 balloons per minute for the\n first 15 minutes, and then double\nher speed for the remaining\n 15 minutes. The question asks for\n the total number of balloons\n blown up. The answer can be\n calculated as follows: We start\n by determining the total number\n of balloons Kris and her\n brother could have blown up in an\n hour. In the first half hour\n (15 minutes), Kris can blow\n up up to 2 * 15 balloons, and her\n brother can blow up 2 * 12\n balloons, so the total number\n of blown up balloons during \nthis half hour is 16 balloons\n for Kris and 14 balloons for her\n \n\nbrother.\n\n  In the other half hour,\nKris will increase her speed\nto 4 balloons, and hence will\nbe able to blow up up to 4 *\n 15 balloon. Her brother will\ndouble his speed\nto 8 balloons. The total\nnumber of balloons blown\nup in the second half hour\nis 12 balloons for Kris\nand 26 balloons for her brother.\n Combining the two results, the\ntotal number of blown up\nballoons during the 30 minute\nperiod is 28 balloons for\nKris and 40 balloons for her \nbrother.This explains the solution to the question and answers it", "answer": " 240"}

{"text": "1) It is important to analyze the question carefully before tackling the question. In this case, the question is asking us to figure out how many fewer pieces of stationary Georgia has compared to Lorene?\n\n2) The key to solving this question boils down to understanding the differences in terms of the comparison between the 2 options. So let's begin by noting the numbers:\n\n* Georgia: 25\n* Lorene: 3 x (Georgia)\n\n3) We can see now that Lorne has 3 times the amount of Georgia. So if Lorene has 3 times Georgia then Georgia = Lorene/3. This means that Georgia has 25 pieces stationary.\n\n4) Once we know that Georgia has 26 pieces of stationary, it becomes clear that Lorene must have 75 (3*26), which is 75 more than Georgia. So for comparison Georgia has '75' fewer than Lorene.\n\n5) Hence, the solution is option 3: 75 fewer\nSo the final answer was: 75\n\nInput: A ship can float on water, but can a boat sail on land?\nOutput: The answer lies in our understanding of the context of the sentence and the words used.\n- The ship refers to a large vessel that is used for transportation on large bodies of water.\n- The boat refers to a smaller, more nimble vessel that is used for water transportation.\n- In terms of what could physically happen, a ship could feasibly float on land, but a boat cannot necessarily do the same because it is smaller and meant for water travel.\n\nHaving this information in mind, now let us apply it to the context the sentence provides us.\n\n- The question asks us if a boat can sail on land?\n- The answer is no because a boat can be built to be capable of operating on water, but a boat cannot be built to operate on both water and land, since it is much more limited in shape and size (compared to a ship).\n\n- Thus, the answer to the question is C: 'No, a boat cannot sail on land.'\n\nSo the final answer, given by a grammar expert, is: C: No, a boat cannot sail", "answer": " 50"}

So we can assume that Alani earned $15 in one hour of time.\n4. Therefore, if Alani earned $10/hour, she would earn 2/3 of the rate given.\n5. The output question asks how many hours of baby-siting at the rate of $15 an hour would earn $75.\n6. We know that Alani earned in 1 hour, so we multiply $15 by 2, which equals $30 in 1 hour.\n7.

Next, we need to figure out how many people the bus system carries for a month if the bus system goes for 13 weeks.\n3. To do this, we can create a table with the quantity for 13 weeks, and a calculation for the number of people each week.\n4. The table would look like this:\n5. We can then use the sum function to find the total number of people for 13 weeks:\nThe sum function takes two arguments, the start and the end. The value for the start is 0, and end is the number of units we want to sum, which in this case is 12. So we use 0 to 12.\n6. The sum function then calculates the value for each unit.\n7. So now, based on the values in our formula, we can multiply 400010 by our formula and get our answer as 12,800,004.\n8. Now we must write down the unit for which we want to calculate the answer.

{"text": "1. To solve this type of problem, it is best to start by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable parts.\n2. Here, the goal is to determine how much money John needs to pay for his medication each day.\n3. We can start by setting up our first equation. We want to compare how much he must pay day-by-day (equation b1) with how much the insurance company covers each day (equation b2).\n4. From this, we observe that our equation is $1.5$ and $b2$ representing the daily cost of John's medication.\n5. We can rewrite equation b1 to get $eqA$. So now equation b1 is $b1 = eqA = $1.5\n6. Next, we need to find the insurance rate for John. This is represented by equation b2. Since John's insurance covers 4/10, we subtract b2 (equation b3) from 10.5, which is the total cost per day.\n7. Equation b3 is used to find the total cost per day of John's medications.\n8. Since b3 is equal to 105/100, there is at least one variable left in equation b3.\n9. At this point, we will assume that we cannot solve for the variable that remains and use what is called the elimination method.\n10. As a result of this, we can isolate b3, thus creating equation b4.\n11. As a result of writing each equation in this manner, we created equation b4.\n\n12.

{"text": "The first step is to identify the problem statement: Mr. Callen bought 27 paintings and 12 wooden toys and sold them at a loss.\nLet's analyze the given information:\n1. Mr. Callen bought a total of 27 items at $40 each.\n2. Mr. Callen also bought a total of 12 wooden toy items at $20 each.\n3. When he sold the items, he lost 10% on the paintings and 15% on the wooden toys.\n4. Based on the above information, we can write the formula: \"The total selling price=the total purchase price \u00d7 (100-percentage of loss)\"\n5. The lost percentage is calculated as follows:\n-Paintings: 10% = (100-10) = 10%\n-Toys: 15% = (10-15 = 5%)\n6. Now, we can apply the formula to solve the problem:\n-Mr Callen's total purchase price = 40\u00d710+20\u00d712\n-Mr Callen\u2019s lost profit = (40\u00d710)/(40\u00d710)+20\u00d712)/20\u00d712=80/200\n-Mr Callen lost profit = $\\frac{200}{400}*12=6$\nSo the answer is: Mr. Callen made a loss of $6 from his sale of paintings and toys.\n\nInput:I had a bowl of cereal and I had a bowl of fruit and I had a fruit salad.

{"text": "The first step in solving this problem is to determine the distance between Yolanda's house and her work, as this information is needed to determine the total time it will take Yolanda and her husband to finish their trips. Since we know Yolanda travels at 20 mph, we can work out the distance she has traveled if it takes her 15 minutes to arrive at her workplace. Using the formula d=vx t (distance = velocity x time), we arrive at the solution that Yolanda has traveled a distance of 1/12 miles.\nNow we know the distance Yolanda must travel, we must also determine the distance her husband must travel to reach her. As her husband follows the exact same route, knowing that he travels at 40 mph, we again use the equation d=vx t to determine the distance. After 15 minutes, this would be equivalent to 6/4 x 15 minutes, or 15/2 miles.\nNow, we can combine both distances to find the total amount of time for her and her husband to reach their goal. By using the formula t=d/v, Yolanda's husband must reach her in 15/40 miles/minutes, or 15 minutes. This is precisely how long it takes Yolanda and her spouse to complete their trips individually.\nSo the final solution is:\nTime for Yoland and her husband to reach each other = 15 mins", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "We first need to consider the values. Given 30 guests and 2 servings each, that means we have an expected demand of 60 servings. Next, each recipe calls for 2 pots of salt and 4 pots of potatoes, so that means each recipe requires 6 pots of salt and potatoes to execute. Each recipe therefore calls for 3 pots of salt. Next we determine per unit costs. 4 pots of salt costs 10 cents. Each batch of recipe therefore requires us to spend 30 cents on salt. Now we compute units needed. We compute how many servings are needed from the batches.\nNext we determine how many batches are needed: 30 guests/60 servings = 0.5 batches per 40 guests. 40 guests/ 6 = 6.67 batches. Now we compute how many batches we need given our initial information. 60 servings/2 batches = 30 30 = 30 servings = 3 batches. 30 guests/3 batches = 10 guests/batch. 40 guests = 4 batches. 3 batches - 10 guests = 20 guests. 20 guests/0.5 batches = 40 guests/2 batches = two batches. Thus we ultimately obtain 2 batches. We therefore need a total of 4 pots of salts and 8 pots of potatoes. Given our per unit costs of 30 cents for salt and $2 for potatoes, we can easily compute the total to be spent on food, i.e. $3.68.\nSo our final answer is Food costs $3.68", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "Answer: \n1. For a sixth-grade class, let 'N' represent the number of students that Carla is teaching, including those absent from the classroom.\n2. From the information given, we know 'N' is either the number of students in attendance minus the number of students absent, or three times as large as the number of students absent plus the number in the restroom.\n3. From the choice of '2 students in the restroom', we know that those two are not absent from the classroom, so it is possible to divide and subtract, so:\n4. N = S + A - 2\n5. And from the choice 'one less than three times that', we know 'n' minus '3N' is less than one hundred, so we can assume '3N' is greater than 'n'.\n6. So we can restate the above as:\n7.

{"text": "The answer is: 1. I know that \"James\" pays for his meal, so he must be the \"first person\" according to the given input sentence. 2. Since the statement tells us that James paid for his own meal, we know that we do not need to worry about the tip of his meal, since he is paying for the meal himself. 3. Then, we subtract the tip from the total, leaving us with $14. 4. We know that the \"second person\" (James's friend) \"pays\" to \"half of the bill\". 5. The first step is getting the half of the bill, we can subtract the \"tip\" from the total leaving us with half of the total (which we don't know). 6. The second step is using the half of the total, then we multiply the total by the \"percent\" that we are \"tipping\", and then we subtract that answer from the half of the total. 7.

How many marbles can you use if you want 2 reds and 2 of the other colors? Choices: 1A: 35 B: 16 C: 47 D: 0 E: 17\nOutput:1. The first step in answering this question is to identify the key information. We are given a set of marbles and are tasked with choosing two of a specified color, and two of another specified color, with no repetition. We can further organize this information by creating a table that contains each of the possible color combinations:\n2. The blue marbles cannot be used in the first two color groups, as they are already used. We can determine this by cross-checking each color group. For example, there are already 2 red marbles, which means we cannot have 2 red marbles and 2 blue marbles.\n3. We can use this logic to quickly eliminate choices A and B. The first color group has 2 red marbles already and two other colors, so it is not possible to have 2 of each color and 3 marbles total.\n4. Now we look at choice C, which is 47. We have 2 red marbels, so we must choose 1 red and 1 of the other two colors. We have 2 blue marbles, so it cannot also be 47. So choice E is out, because it has 15 in the same category, when there should be 2 in each group. This narrows down the choices to 36 and 28.\n5. We can quickly eliminate choice D, which cannot have 1 red and 2 of the remaining colors.\n6. Thus we are left to choose between choice E and choice F, which gives us a total of 47 and 36 respectively. Both answers are valid, so the final answer is F: 36", "answer": " 108"}

Randy has some money in piggy bank(assumed to be in $) and goes to the store 4 times per month and makes 2 $ for every trip to the store. He has 104 $ left after 1 year(assumed to be 12 months). \n\nThe first thing to do here is to eliminate the time in our calculations. As the question gives 30 trips in a year, so we multiply 30 by 2 to get the total amount he pays in 30 trips which is $60. \n\nNext we have to find the total amount he gets in 30 trios. We use the formula below to get this:\n*Costs($2) = Total trips X Cost\n*Total Trips = $104/2\n*Total Trips=52Trips\n*$52/2 = Trips\n*Trips = $26\nNow that we have the Total Trips and Total Costs we can add it to find his total income:\nIncome = total amount he spends/2 - \ntotal Cost = $60- $26 = $34\n\nThus his income after a year is $34. \n\n# Code:\nimport code_from_here\nnum_1 = code_from_here.answer_this_problem(input_text_2)\nprint(f'You got this right {num_1}')\n\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question\n\nIs the following number divisible by 3?

{"text": "1, 2. The first step is read each sentence of the question (including the answer choices) carefully and understand what they mean.\n2. After that get the variable names from the question. For example in the example, Earl, Fred and Greg are variable names.\n3. Once we get the variable names in the context of the question we have to make a table with the given information. This can be done like this.\nInput:Early 90 48 36\nFred 48 32 36\nGreg 36 _ _\nAfter this we have to substitute the variable names in the statement which corresponds to the given question, and then we have to do it again for the statement under question number II, and then again in the case of statement III, and finally in the case of statement IV.\n4. Thus, the table will look something like this (variable names are in square brackets):\nEarl (E) 90 (90) 48 (48) 36 (36)\nFred (F) 48 (90) 32 (48) 48 (36)\nGreg (G) 36 (F) -28 (48) -32 (48)-40 (32)\nThe answer: The total at the end of the day is Greg $148 and Earl 160. This can be understood by looking at the table carefully.\nGreg (G): We start with Greg (G) because G has 28 that he owes to Fred (F) and then we apply III (Greg owes Earl 40). So G-40 is equal to 128 and we subtract 58 (F + 32 + D) from 28 and we get 28 - 58 = -30 (F). Then once we subtract 38 from 48 we get 10 which is Gregory's balance in dollars.\nEarl ( E): Similar reasoning is applied for Earl, and the final balance should be $160.\n5. Then the final answer is $148+ $160 which equals to $308. So the correct answer is $308.\n\nInput: In a recent high school poll, 5", "answer": " 130"}

For e.g, 3 and 5 (these 2 numbers are consecutive prime numbers whose sum will be 8), 5 and 7 (sum 12), and 7 and 11 (sum 18). Thus 7 and 13 (sum 20) will give us a pair of consecutive prime numbers. But what if we have multiple pairs of sums? For e.g. 5 and 7 give us a sum of 12. So does 11 and 13 give us 24. This will occur multiple numbers in a row. Therefore, the goal is to determine the sum that is being searched for.\nA method of finding the sum is to add the primes up until getting a square. For e.g. with the above two examples, if the sum is 20, the sum can be found by adding two primes which are 20 which is a square. If it is 34, the sum is obtained by adding two primes that result in the square of 34. \nBy doing this, we can conclude that 3*3=9.9,4*4=16,5*5=25,7*7=28.9,8*8=64.0.

How many peanuts Mr Brown bought (in number)?\nOutput: 1) The word 'one time' gives us the clue that Mr Brown has bought the peanuts 'once' and not more or less. So the word 'one' would be replaced by the word 'a'.\n2) We have 'a' bag of peanuts which means there is no need to use the number 'a' in our final answer which can only be a cardinal number like 6, 7, 8 etc.\n3) The word'many' refers to countable nouns like peanuts not uncountable ones like peanuts. Hence, peanuts can be replaced with just one singular word number, meaning that Mr Brown has bought '6 peanuts from the shop'.\n4) The sentence provides enough information to answer the question that the final answer is 6 peanuts.\nSo the final formula is: Number bought = 'a' because it is a 'one time' from the store = 6 peanuts\n\nInput: If the number of women on the board is odd then so many on the board, the gender balance will be achieved, how about we evened-out half with the odd ones?\nOutput: \n1.

{"text": "The answer to the question is 8.\n\nFor the sake of brevity in this answer, I will explain how to solve this problem as opposed to explaining the algorithm.\nThe problem presents us with the equation 8*(8/3) > 0\nThis becomes 8 > 0.8\nIf 8 > 0, then 8 > 8 = 0\nTherefore, 8 = 8\n8*8/3 = 8\nThe given problem can therefore be rewritten as:\n(8)(8/3) > (8/3)\nThen dividing both sides by 8, we get 8/8 > 1/3\nThen multiplying both sides by 3 we get 8/24 > 1/9\nFinally, since 24 > 9, multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of 24 (1/24) will yield a fraction greater than 1/9.\nThe final result is: 8/3/8 > 10/27\nDivide 10 by 27, and we get 10/21 > 1\nThe answer then, is 8/3/6 > 1 or 8/3 > 1.\nSince no fractions are involved and we need to only consider one variable, we can then replace the fraction with the number.\n8/3 is equal to 2.75\nThus, 8/3 >1 is equal to 2/3 > 1\nThus, the answer is 2.\n\nInput: If the two sides of a right angled triangle are 4 and 5 inches long, then the length of the hypotenuse will be...(please explain, thanks)\nOutput: In a triangle, the \"opposite\" of a side is the side with the same vertex as the given side.

{"text": "1) The first step in answering this question is to clearly define the input variables and specify their range. This helps to make sure that all the data is compatible and accurate. 2) The next step is to identify all the necessary steps and operations required to answer the question. For example, we need to know the total number of days for which the nuts were stored, and also the total number of nuts stored by each squirrel. 3) We then need to identify all the relationships and interactions between the different variables. For example, the total number of nabs stored is equal to the sum of all the nuts stored by each day. 4) We then need to model the problem in algebraic form using the identities already formed and the relationships between variables. This helps to identify any missing information that we may need. 5) Finally, we can substitute the values in the equations to answer the problem. 6) In this particular example, we have 40 squirrel days, and 30 nuts per squirrel per day. For the two squirrels, we have 30*2=60 nuts stored per day for them combined. Now, for the remaining slow squirrel of the 3, we have 20 nuts per day. So we have 30+60+20 =110 nuts stored per squirrel. Thus we now have 30+3*30+2*20 = 450 nuts stored, making the final answer 450 nuttys.", "answer": " 3200"}

{"text": "1: Count the number of loads of laundry by making an array with a length of 8. For example: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7].\n2: Next, the amount of time each load takes in the wash cycle can be calculated. This can be done by adding up the individual values in the array. For example: [45, 45, 44, 45,40,49,46,49]\n3: We're multiplying the length of each load (in our example, [45] and [45] are repeated 4 times) by the number of loads in the array [8]. Then, multiply the wash cycle time by the overall length of the array (8) and again by the number of loads. This would result in the value 8(8)(7)=488.\n4: In the next step, we are calculating the time it takes to complete each load. To do this, we are multiplying a load in the array with the amount of time it takes. For each value in the array (0=45 minutes and 7 =1 hour), do a multiplication, this is equal to 488.\n5: Multiplying (loadtime*arraylength) is equal to [0*(45*8)] + [1*(45*8)+ 2*(40*8)] + [3*(49*8)] + [4*(44*8)] + [5*(45*8)].

Now this equation tells us that A multiplied by itself, A, equals twice A. Therefore, A=2, so we know that A is 2.\n2. We want to find out what B equals in the given equation for the problem statement. To do so, lets first reassign B = 5. Now, using the original equation, B*B = A*A + B * B. This is an extremely confusing statement, but let us work through the problem to try to figure out what it means. We can see that using the given information, A = 2, so by substitution, this equation simplifies to 2*5 + 5*5. The value of 2*5 +5*5 is 30, but for our purpose, it is just a good approximation of what the final answer is. Therefore, we know that 2*5 as the value of B. \n3. With B = 5, the answer to the problem is now very easy to get.

We can see that the second field has more corn rows than the first field. One way to approach this problem is to notice that the two fields have the same number of cobs. Since each corn row has 4 cobs, the total number of cobs is equal to the sum of the numbers of corn rows in the first and second fields. So if we add the number of corn rows in both fields and we can find the total number of cob that the farm has grown.\n3.The total number of cobs = (number of corn rows in first field) + (number of corn rows) in the second field = 13 + 16= 29\nThus 29 is the total number of cops\nSo the final answer to your question \" How many corn cobs has farm grown? \" is that farmers have grown 29 corn cops from those 2 fields.\n\n\nInput: In which grade did you start school\nOutput:1. Let's start this problem by looking at the choices and seeing what each word means.\n\n2. 'Grade' is a word that refers to a level that students go through in their education. For example, students may go through first grade, second grade, and so on.\n\n3. 'Start' is a verb that means to begin. So start may refer to beginning something.\n\n4. To'school' is a verb that usually refers to attending school or being educated. It can also refer to a place where children are educated, for example, like our school, a school.\n5. Thus we have to analyze the context as a student may be asked about his/her starting school, this means the student is not asked about his/her grade as it does not refer to the students school career and starts as a verb,so now answer to the this input question is that the student has started the school in the \"Kindergarten Grade\"", "answer": " 116"}
{"text": "Choices: 1. Legoland has 5 koalas for each kangaroo, which makes a total of 5 x180 koalas.\n2. Legoland has a total of 80 koalas and kangoaras.\n3. The second part of the question is asking for the total number of koalas, so if we subtract the number of koalas we know about, we are left with the number of koalars and kangoaras: 80-50.\n4. The answer to this question is 81 koalas.\n5. Option B: kangaroos and koalas is incorrect because it does not take into consideration the 5 kangaroes for each koala, and option D: koalas is incorrect as if Legoland has 350 kangaroes, and only 50 koalas, we know that the number of kangaroos have to be higher than the number of koalss as the ratio of koalas to kangaroos is 5 to 1, and so option B: koalas and kangaoros is incorrect as it does not take into account the ratio of koalss to kangaroos.\n6. Option E: kangoaros and koalas cannot be the correct answer because if you take the ratio of Legoland koalas to koals and take away 180 from it, the ratio is no longer correct.\n7. Option A: koalas cannot be correct as it does not take the 5 to 1 ratio given in the question.\n8. Option D Koalas is incorrect as it does take the 5 to ration into account, but does not account for the total number of kangaroes.\n9. Option C: koalas and koalas is therefore the answer is C: koalas.\n1. This is the part about the cottages, but you'll be able to tell from what's left on the screen where you'll need to look.\n2. The cottage has 43% of the windows painted.\n3. If each window had one paint job, then the question is not referring to multiple paint jobs per window (as in option A and B), but instead, asking for the total number (in", "answer": " 216"}

{"text": "10 The first step is to identify the units being used in the problem: bananas, cups of banana mush, and cups of flour. We need to keep track of these units to keep the math consistent.\n2. The next step is to identify the ratios at play in the problem. Hannah uses 3 cups of wheat flour for every cup on banana mush. This can be expressed as 1 wheat :3 banana mush.\n3. Next, we need to establish the number of bananas in the original ratio: 1 bananana = 4 cup(s) banana mush. 20 bananas can thus be expressed as 80 cups of banana.\n4. The last step is to solve the ratio using the new units. We need to use the known banana to flour ratio and the banana quantity to figure out how many cups of wheat we need in the recipe.\n5. We start off with the above-mentioned ratio: 1 :3.\n6. The banana quantity: 80 cups.\n7. Thus our final ratio is: 3:80\n8. And finally, the answer is : 10 cups of wheat for every cup of bananaw\nSo the final answer i s 10 cups\n\nOutput:1-3/7 x (4-5+3-5) = 0-45", "answer": " 15"}

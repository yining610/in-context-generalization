{"idx": 5, "text": "A) James writes 96 pages if his friends were the same.\nB) He can write 255 pages if he wrote twice the pages to different friends.\n  A) Choice A is correct.\nThe question first asks us to determine how many pages will be written to each friend, every week.\nIt says James writes to each friend twice, a week.\nTherefore James would write 2 letters to each friend per week.\nIf each letter is 3 pages long, each friend will get 6 pages every week.\nWe can multiply 6 x 52 weeks to get 312 pages written to each friend that year.\nNow that we've calculated that James writes 312 pages of the same letter to his friends, we can calculate the total number of pages he wrote every week by multiplying the same number by 52 (the number of weeks to a year).\nSo, the total number of letters he wrote in a year will be 16 * 312 = 5,072 pages.\nSo, the total letter James wrote in a year would be 7 letters, including two letters he sends to two different friends on a different day in the week.\nHence, the correct answer to Question 2 is A.\nSo the final answers is A: 7\n\nInput: James writes 3 page letters to 2 different friends every week. How many pages does he writes a year?\nOutput\n  A) The correct answer to this question is 7.\n  A) The question first asks us to find out how many letters James will write in a year to two friends, where each letter is 3-pages long.\nSo, the number of letters James will write to both friends will be 2 x 3 = 6 letters.\nAlso, James writes letters to these two friends, at different times.\nTherefore, he writes 6 letters in a week, which comes out to 7,344 pages.\nTo find out the amount of pages, you will be required to multiply the amount of letters James is planning on writing in a year by the number of weeks in a year.\nSo, he will write 7,340,000 in a year.\nThis statement can also be expressed as 7,343,538.2 letter pages.\nHence,", "answer": " 624"}
{"idx": 6, "text": "1) We can plug in the information we're given, starting with how many flowers Mark already has.

Finally, for green, we write one zero but in science a zero without a period is also equal with zero.\n\nN(y) = 0.64\nN(p) = 0.012\nN(g) = 0\n\n6) That means that Mark has 0.64 purple, 1.2 green and 87 yellow flowers in his garden.\nSo the final Answer is B: There are 87 yellow and 64 purple flowers, 12 green flowers.\n\nInput: Why is the man not able to lift his bicycle?

You can also figure out what cat stands for if you're familiar with the saying 'What's in a name? A rose by any other name would smell as sweet. If you don't understand that, it means that the name a rose has doesn't change how it smells.\n3. In the same way, Lion is also another name used for the cat\n4.

The chapters were numbered from 1 to 10. Each chapter had 20 people or ghostwriters who helped create the book. How many people helped create the book.\nOutput:Option A is the correct answer.The ghostwriters were assigned chapters, and each chapter had 20 members. The chapters have the numbers from 1 to 20, totaling 20. Since the book took 300 ghosts to produce which means that each chapter had 5 members and 4 chapters were left. So in total there are 4 x 5 = 20. So the number of ghostwriters is 20 + 20 = 40. But the total number of ghostwrites was 300 so 300-30 = 270.

There are certain things to take care of before we can begin solving this question:\n2. 10 cups + 16 cups = 26 cups, which is half of the 52 cups, since 26 is half of 52 in two different ways.\n3. 52 is the sum of 16, 16, and 26 (because 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 is the same as 52).\n4. Now, in the same way that 26 is half 52, there is an equivalent fraction in the expression for 2.6 times half of 52 cups equals 2.6 times 1/52 cups.\n5. That makes the equivalent fraction for 2.6 cups in the formula 2.6 times less than a 52nd.\n6.

Thus, a ruler is used to measure equal lengths of various things but it's only appropriate to cut equal lengths with tools such as knives.\n\n2 - Measuring tape: Can be used to measure or to cut the length of something because it's easy to fold it over itself to create equal segments or sub-pieces that are easily cut even by simple household tools such as scissors.\n\n3 - Screwdriver: Is more associated with moving and turning things within objects than cutting them. Also, a screwdriver can be used to cut something, but there are better implements for doing so.\n\n4 - Compass: It's an instrument used to draw circles, not to cut something, because a compass is used only to create circular shapes.\nSo the final one are: 1) A ruler and 2) Measuring tape.\n\nInput: Which words are in the same syllable family as the word \"thunder?\" Choices:  A) raindrop B) cloud C) hail D) dust storm E)", "answer": " 25"}

Therefore, L > I.\n11.Since we have that T \u2013 J > (36L - 36I) \u2013 (A \u2013 B), we`re going with division: ((T \u2013 J)/ (36L \u2013\n  36I) = (A \u2013 B)/ B\n12.So, the last equation that we have is :(A(B) - A) / (B) = (T \u2013 J)/ (L \u2013 I).\n\n1.Finally, dividing (4500 \u2013 1400)/ (650- 450):\n(A(B) -A)/ (B) = (1100 - 600) / (200 \u2013 100)\n\n2.Since the last equation has 1000 and 600 as common, the answer is 600.\n\nSo the final answer for this question", "answer": " 5"}

'How much' - the answer\n\nIn order to solve this question, we must first convert the value for each ingredients into a unit of measurement that will allow us to solve the equation. The pounds of beef must be converted into pounds since that is the only unit mentioned for that ingredient. The chicken must also be converted into pounds since the question doesn't specify how much weight is in dollars and we need to ensure that the unit is consistent for each ingredient. With this, the equation becomes\nBeef = 1000 x $8\nChicken = 2 * 1000 where 1000 = 100 x $3\n\nWe can then simplify this, and multiply the equation, getting\n1000 x (100 x $8) \n\nFrom 8:\n8 x 8 = 64\nMultiply all three products to get\n1000(100 x 64) \n\nFrom the previous question you would note that if $1 x 1 = 1, then $2 x 2 = 4.

There's a big gap between 20 pages and 100 pages, therefore, we can make the following assumption: if \u201cX\u201d refers to what she read from 4:00 PM to 5:00PM, we can say \u201cThe number of pages read by Mitchell is equivalent to X - 20\u201d\n   3) After adding 2 more chapters, this brings us to the next page: Mitchell had read the 800 pages of the previous 10 chapters, adding the following two chapters (800 + 2 * 40 =) 840 pages or Mitchell had read 800 pages the previous 10 CHAPTERS, two chapters after 4:00, therefore, 800 + 40 + 2 * \u201cX\u201d = 882 (\u201cX\u201d does not refer to the amount she read from 4 to 5:0)\n   4) If we put \u201c62\u201d instead of \u201cX\u201d, (since it\u2019s a 11th chapter, therefore, \u201c11\u201d - \u201c10\u201d = \u201c1\u201d) the answer is 882 = 800 + \u201cX\u201d + 40 + \u201cX\u201d = 1112; the question does not specify what chapter Mitchell read in total in each step of her studying.

{"idx": 172, "text": "1) The question asks about the number of trees that James planted after picking all the fruits from two trees.\n2. To answer this question, we need to understand what part of the question is relevant to the answer.\n3. We see that the two trees have 20 plants each, i.e. a total of 40 plants out of which 1/4 (~25%) were seeds.\n4. We don't even have the seeds available of all the fruit plants, out of which, 80% are planted with a maximum of 3 seeds each.\n5. We also know that out of 60% or about 24% of the seeds planted are viable, each planted with 3 seeds.\n6. The problem is, we don't have 40 plants of fruit with the seeds of which, 24% of at least 80% (24 * 75% = 18%) are planted.\n7. Since this seems like more mathematics than the answer requires, we are deducting the answer to 18, and that gives us 2 trees.\n8. So, to answer the question, we need to focus on the problem at hand.\n9. To sum it up, we have to plant 60% of 20 plants which equals 12 trees. And with 63 viable seeds available, each of which plants 3 viable seeds equally, we get 19 trees.\nSo the final answers is 20 divided by 4=5 trees.\nSo the answer is 2 or 20 divided by four is 5 (2 divided by 4 is 3 trees or 4 divided by4 is 2) since it is clear that there are 20 trees in each case.", "answer": " 24"}

I understand that \"headstart\" means a period of time advantage, as opposed to distance advantage.\n5th.

This means that the turtle must finish in a tie for the head start to be equal to the time required for it to finish.\n\n7th.

So if area is 512 m2 then B would be to right corner and A to the left corner. But here its to the bottom and top i.e (B-A) will be negative. Thus the formula needed to determine the area is `L * (B-A)` where L is equal to the length of rectangle i.e `(B-A)/2`.

We're given the context of a company with 200 employees, with 120 (60% of 200) of them driving to work and half of the other 80 taking public transportation, i.e. 40.\n3.  Since 40 of them don't drive, those 40 cannot include any of the 120 drivers, so that leaves 80 non-drivers.\n4.  We don't know if those 80 all take public transportation or if there are others amongst them.\n5.  Hence, we can't determine the driving population and the public transit population by just adding up the totals.\n6. Next, let's try using the 50% approach.\n7. Out of 80 non-driving employees, let's assume 40 employees take public transportation and the remaining 40 walk.\n8. But in this scenario, the total amount of commuters would be 120 drivers + 40 public transit takers + 40 walkers, for a total of 200 employees commuting.\n9. This would mean that those who commute by public transit have increased and the number who commute by car or walk are unchanged by 10 when compared to the original scenario.\n10. But this isn't the case, since 200 employees are required and 200 is the total population of commuters.\n11. So, we're back to square 1.\n12.  That's ok, though.

{"idx": 236, "text": "1)Max asked for model trains for his age each year. He starts with 0 trains and receives two each year for his five birthdays, which puts him at a total of 10 trains.  At Christmas, he receives two trains, so his total is 12.  At the end, his mother gives him \u201cdouble\u201d (i.e. twice as many) models trains as he has, which means that he ends up with 24 trains.\n2)Each of the gifts he asks his mother for are 1 train. His mother always gives him the gifts that he asked for, this means that after 5 years he has 50 models trains. He now asks his mother for half as many models trains as he has. Half of 50, as his mother has double the number of trains she gives at Christmas, is 25. Which means that his mother ends up giving him 25 models trains.\n3)Max asked for 134 models trains. 13 is repeated twice. So 13 model trains every year would be 130. But the correct answer is 25. So the only possible answer would be 25 models trains, which is the closest number to 134 that is a multiple of 2.\nSo the final solution is C: 25\n\nInput: What does the car do if the car has an automotive problem?

{"idx": 339, "text": "1) Let us first figure out the total distance travelled by the truck. We can get this by calculating (Distance from home to supermarket)+(Distance from home to farm)+Distance from supermarket to farm. This formula is D=[3(distance from home to supermarket)](Distance from home to home)+ (distance from supermarket to farm)\n2)Let us take a step back and figure out what the speed of the truck is. There are two ways to calculate this. First, suppose you know the distance from home to supermarket and the distance from supermarket to farm and assume we have found the total distance traveled by the truck, we can find the speed.\nThe formula for this is Speed= total distance/ time to travel, In this question, we can find the total distance from supermarket to home as 2 gallons of fuel used by the truck implies that total distance traveled is 10 miles. So the total distance that has been traveled by the Truck is 10 miles, The second method to calculate this is to divide the total distance traveiled by the truck into distance to supermarket and distance from supermarket to the farm.\nThe formula for the second one is\nSpeed = Total distance / Total distance = (10-4) / 4 = 6 3) Using the speed we calculated in step 2, we can find out the time it took the truck to travel the total distance of 10 miles. Since we know the time it took the Truck to travel from home to supermarket, we can find the time and add this to calculate total time.\nThe Formula for this is Time = Speed * Difference in distance ( home to supermarket + super market to farm =2). Therefore, total time = 2/6 = 0.333 minutes (time in minutes) and the speed=6(Miles per hour)\n4) So we have got our speed (Miles per hour) in mile per hour. Finally, to find the rate at which the Fuel was used by the truck in this journey. Given the fuel usage, we can find the fuel used per minute,\nThe formula of this is: Fuel usage per minute = Fuel usage / (Speed/60) and here fuel usage = 2 gallons so the Fuel usage per minute is 2/10 Gallons per minute", "answer": " 2"}

The question is asking how many pieces of rope we need to buy.\n3. We know that it will be lowered in 6 stories and the rope we are using is 20 feet, so if each store requires a 10 feet long rope then we would need 6 pieces of rope. (20*6/10)\n4. Now, we are losing 25% (3/12/100%) of the rope when lashing it to complete the task. (6/20)*(3/12/00)\n5.

We can assume Jackson doesn\u2019t bring any peanut butter sandwiches to school on his \u201cmissing days\u201d then we can just count all the PBJ sandwiches. We could also assume that Jackson only got PBJ sandwich 1 time per week while he missed 3 days then we can just multiply 12, which is how many months in a year, by 3 to get 36 of his daily PBJ. \n3rd step: Write down all possible solutions.  For example, 16.75  because 36/2=18 which gives  18*J= 36; Jackson ate 36 PBJ this school year.\n\nOutput: 4. I have found a very cool tip to solve this question is to know about mod, it means the relationship of reminder (the unused fraction) and number.\n5. Using the modular arithmetic, we could multiply 47 (the number of PBJ he get each month) by (number of days he has missed school) to find out how many jars of PBJ he ate.\nFirst of all, we can know that \u201c6 mod 7 = 3\u201d so we must subtract \u201c(47*6)/5\u201d from \u201c47\u201d.\n        \u201c6 mod 7= 3\u201d because \u201c6-7=1\u201d so \u201c47 divided to 5= 3\u201d \u201c6/7= 0.85714\u201d so \u201c47/5= 9.4\u201d    which means 47-9.4= 37.6\n\nSo there are 37.6 jars of PB&J or 38 jars of PB and J sandwiches he ate for school lunch.\nSo the final answers is 38", "answer": " 69"}

The given steps are: Keaton (Keaton climbed a x feet ladder x times)\n    Reece (Reece climbed a y feet ladder z times)\n\n3. Since Reece climbed a 4 feet shorter ladder x times, to find x, let's consider the ladder lengths and find the ratio of the lengths between two ladders.\n   30 feet ladder x 20 = 120 feet\n     15 feet ladder x 15 = 90 feet\n\n4. We can apply division and find out that (x = 120/90 = 1.28).\n\n5. We can also apply division again and find out that (z = 20/15 = 2.66)\n6. After calculating ratio we can arrive at that Keaton climbed a ladder of length 30 feet and Reece climbed 1.28 times the length of this ladder.\n   So Keaton climbed a 1.28 *30 feet ladder 20 times\n   while Reece, also worked at the same site,climbed a ladder 2.66 times shorter, i.e. 8.54feet.\n\n7. So the total time of 1.28*30 and 8.54*15 which sums to 264 feet, or 80.4m. Thus the total length of the ladder both workers climbed comes with a total length of (264) inches\nSo since x=1.28,\n          we can finally write: (264)=(30+1.28*15)\nWe can write this to solve for the initial condition:\n          (30 + 20*1.28 = (264))\n          (30+32.28=264)\n         32.28 = 264-(30)\n         264-(32.28)=264-(40.28)\n         +(32.28) = 0\n\nSo x=1.245 which", "answer": " 11880"}

Based on this, we can say that the number of bales harvested from the 5 acres = (5 ac x 560 bale per month) =108 (bales/month).\n\n2) Then we have to calculate the number of horses which can be estimated as 7 acres of grass = 35 bales (1 acre = 12 ft2/acre x 5 ft x 4 ft = 8 ft2 per foot x 1000 =1200 sq ft/acre) = 6200 (ft2/acre) = 213 bales (1 bale/ 9000 ft2). This 213 bale is the number of hay harvested in one acre.\n\n3) Finally, we have to calculate the remaining hay for the rest of the year, including January to December. Now from above calculation, we know the monthly yield of the farmer from 5 acres of hay is (108 bales/month) which is multiplied by the number of months in his yearly yield. From this calculation, we get the number of bales which are expected to be harvested which are (108 x 12) bales or 1,296 bales. Which means the number of bales that would be harvested from 7 acres of grass per month or (1,296 x 7) bales or 9,388 bales.\n\n4) So, from the above calculation we can say that the remaining hay left by the end of the December with the beginning of September is (9,388 \u2014 213/day x100) i.e. 9,175 bales.\nSo the final number of bales is 9175\n\nInput:In some languages, a 11-tile is called \"Feng\" but in others is called \"Zhu\".

West is definitely a wrong answer choice. \nNow we'll look at the remaining 3 options: \nEast is the obvious answer. It is only possible for one clock hand if all the things happen with one clock, to be pointing to the other end of the circle, which means it must be pointing to the east. \nThe other option can be Downward.

Choices: 48:75:90 A: B: C: D: E: F: G\nOutput:  1. The question states that there are a number of ratios in the form of fractions, with the first and third ratios being whole numbers.\n2. The question requests us to identify the fraction with the least amount of oil. We can quickly infer  that options E and F must therefore have more oil content.\n  3. Since the first fraction is 48:72, we can use the following formulas to convert fractions to decimals : (A) = 0.61, (B) = 0.81, (C) = 0.5, (D) = 50%, (E) = 0.92, (F) = 0.73, (G) =74%.\n  4. Hence, by applying the formula '50%+X' (Where 'X' is the remaining 42%), we get:\n      'X' = 42*50/100 = 21%\n      So there is 21% remaining oil content.\n      5. Thus, Option G should contain the least amount of oil, since 21% is the smallest percentage compared to the other choices.\n\nSo the answer is G: 74%\n\nInput: According to some research, people under 18 cannot use cash as a form of payment for what?

Choices:  (A) drink (B) relax (C) read (D) work (E) sleep\nOutput:1. When you are sitting, you cannot have drink water while staying sizzling and resting on a chair. Hence, it can be inferred that B) relax, D) work, and E) sleep are not possible choices. Moreover, the water is most likely not inside the room because the question suggests that it is resting on the ground.\n2. The wording of the question strongly suggests that you are sitting under the sun when you drink water and that the water is cold because if it was hot it would not be possible to have drink water on a hot,sizzling day or any other day, unless you are in a sauna.\n3. As per the given statement, you cannot sleep when you are relaxing, and you cannot work when relaxing so it suggests that it is quite possible that you are reading.

First, let us note the variable constraint as follows:\n3. The revenue from the chickens that he sold was $65.\n4. The cost of chicken feed was $2 which is included in the selling cost of the chickens.\n5. From the given information, we can conclude the following:\n6. The selling price of the chickens was $1.50 each. He sold each chicken at $1.50 after accounting for the cost of the chicken feed (2 pounds).\n7. Here is the list of variables given:\n    - Revenue: $65\n    - Cost of feed: $2\n    - Number of chickens sold: We need to find it out\n8.

What could the team do next?  Choices: A: stop playing B: switch side C: end the game D: end the innings \nOutput: The question asks what a baseball team could do after batting five innings.\n\nHere, the choice'stop playing' is not applicable, as the team is still playing.\n\nThe choice'switch side' is not applicable, since the question mentions that after batting five innnings, the team is called to bat again, so there is no chance for them to switch sides.\n\nThe choice' 'end the game' is not applicable, because a game cannot be ended in its 5th innings. The next question will state whether the game is played for 7 innings, indicating that a game is played for 9 innings, not 7 innings. The next innings will not begin until the team has come to bat again, the game isn't ended.\nThe choice 'end the innings' is correct. The team will be called into bat once again, as there will not be another choice to do that. The team will play another innings, and will return to their'side' of the field the following time.\nSo the final choice is D : end the innings\n\nInput: In a baseball game, there are seven official innings.

{"idx": 481, "text": "1. The first step in solving this question is to calculate the salary Kirt started with.\n2. From the given information, we can estimate that this would be a minimum of $6000 per month or $72,000 per year ($6000 \u00d7 12 months).\n3. Now, we need to identify how much Kirt would earn after one year with a 30% increase in salary.\n\n4. To understand this increase, we can say that each pay cycle of Kirt's salary will be a 30% larger percentage of his original salary.\n5. We then have:\n\n   a) Starting salary = $72,0x0 (Year 1): $72,0\n   b) Increase (% of salary) = 30%\n   c) Increase (as a percentage of original salary) = 72,0% \u00d7 30% = 21,60% \n\n6. Therefore, Kirt's increase is $2,160 per month. When multiplied by 12 months, this gives us his total earnings with a salary of $259,200 per year.\n7. Now, after three years of his job, Kirt's annual salary has increased by 72%. What does this give us?\n8. After 3 years, we can say:\n\n   a. Salary after 3 years = $308,480 per year\n   b. % Increase over Annual Salary = 72% (which reduces to 7.2%)\n   c. Increase (as percentage of new salary) = 1.32%\n9. Therefore, since it's not possible to change the $308, 480 number that much, the $54,280 figure is just the increase (1.32%) of Kirt's starting salary as a percentage of his new salary.\n\n10. $54,2\n11. Therefore, the total amount that Kirt earned from his salary after three years is $362,760.\nSo the final total is $72,0 + $259,", "answer": " 259200"}

{"idx": 498, "text": "1: The question is clear. We have to figure out how much James gets paid for the week.\n2. The payoff depends on the number of points James scores overall.\n3. For the first week, if James averages 30 points per game, he will get paid $10,080 which is 10k ($10,00) for scoring 30 points in 1st game and ($8,0) for scoring 25 points in 2 game together. Hence, James scored an average of 28.5 points. Thus, he will get paid 2 grand.\n4. For the next week, he scored 2 points more than the previous one. Hence, he will receive 2 grand as he had scored 26 points as average.\n5. Similarly we can find what James scored in last week. It is clear that he scored 360 points in total.\n6. However, James doesn't get paid for individual games. His payoff is the average points he scored per game.\n7. Thus, when we consider his scores in all previous games and the 3rd game where he scored 32, we will get this payoff: 30+32+34+360-28=314.5\n8. This also means that he will score on average around 315 points per game in one week.\n9. Hence, James should get $10540 (315*10) for that game.\nSo the final payoff he will get = $10541.5\n\nInput: What type of music does Mr. Jones like? Choices:  C: jazz.B: salsa. A: rock. D: hip hop.

{"idx": 558, "text": "I started with the plan of finding the number of whole tomatoes that Andy had to begin with. In the first sentence, he got 136 tomatoes (7 \u00d7 18). Let this be Y.  Then in the second sentence, we have Andy taking 3/5 of these (5/136). So, this is 5 * (3/136). This is the same as 3/56 (1/19). This is about 5% of Y in the form of dried or sauced tomatoes. \nI then calculated 5% of Y and worked backward. If the amount of undried, non-sauced tomatoes is X, then we know that 5% of Y is 5% * Y. We can substitute that for our target of 5% of Y, and solve,\nY = 50% * (5%*Y), or\nY * 100% = 5% * (50%*Y)\nSubstitute in our values and we know that\nX = 2/3 * 7, or 5/9 of all the tomatoes will be left untouched.\nSo the final equation is\nNumberLeft = Y * 100 (percentage Y was undried) \u2013 X (percentage of X left over).\nSo the final answer can be done as follows.\nInput: Where are people trying to get if they are looking for toys?

We can subtract the first three numbers to get how deep was the drift on the fourth day, and then multiply that by the 34 inches, to get the depth of the drift on the first day.\n3) Subtract 34 from the drift depth on day 1 (to get the drift depth on the fourth day).\nSo, we'll be left with - 8 inches, (which was made of the snowfall after 1 day).\n4) Subtract that total from the drift depth after 4 days.\nSo, the answer is 24/4=6 in inches or 24 inches deep.\nSo the final answers is 24 in inches is the depth of the snowdrift at the end of the 4th day.\n2) 1) To start. we can see that the progressive growth of the drift is measured as the sum of 3 days, 20, 18 and 16.\n2) The drift started at 34 on the first day,\n3) So, we have to get that depth after three days, not the growth of it.\n4) So, 34 subtracted by the first three numbers leaves us with 12/3=4.\n5) Now, we can multiply the 34 by the 4 to get the drift's depth at the end of the one day,\n6) Which, according to the problem, is 5.72 inches.\n7) The 3+, 1.5 inch increment from days one to four would give us 6.22 inches.\nSo the final answe is 6.22.", "answer": " 20"}

Choices:  Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday\nOutput: Since the question is asking about the day which ends the week of March, we need to focus our attention on the day of the first Sunday of the week. To identify the day Sunday, we know that day comes on the 7th day of the week. Therefore, the day which ends the March will start on the second day of the week. This means 2nd Sunday of every month starts on the day of Saturday. To identify the day of the Sunday, we know that the seven days of the week are Monday to Saturday. So day of Friday is the last day of the week. Now, we can compare this information with day on which Sunday starts and it will help us to identify the day which ends the first week which starts on Sunday. By this logic, March first week starts on Tuesday and ends on Friday.\nSo the final answers are: Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in March 2020.

A: Horse is faster than a chimpanzee, so if they faced off in a race, the horse would surely win.\n3. C: Chimpanzees are stronger and have greater endurance. In a fight they'd have a better chance at beating out a horse.\n4. D: Both the horse and the chimpanzee have their own advantages and weaknesses against each other.\n5. E: If the race has obstacles or other difficulties, a horse can be beat out and it's possible a chimp could win, but a straight race would not be favorable.\nSo we have three reasons why the chimpanzee could possibly win. If we factor the two options saying the animals \"could win\" together, it means the chimpanzee has a much lower chance to win.

The question asks us to determine what unit of measurement we use when we know the temperature of a body of water. \n2. We know that water at room temperature is at 25 degrees Celcius and that water can have different temperatures. \n3. To determine which unit of measurement is used when water has a known temperature you need to look at which units of measurement are used for temperature.\n4. Water temperature is measured in units, the Kelvin scale, or Kelvins.\n5. Therefore, when you know the temperature for any particular element or object, you can use the Kelvin scale as a unit of measurement to describe the temperature of that element or object.\n6. However, this only provides a unit of measurement when you also know the object's exact temperature on the Kelvin scale.\n7. Water is not the only temperature or element that is measured in Kelvins so this is the unit of measurement used to describe the temperature of water but does not offer an equivalent unit of measurement for when water has a different temperature.\n8. When water is at room temperature, the unit of measurement is Celsius or C, because this matches the temperature.\n9. If the temperature is 10C, the unit of measurement would be C. \n10. However, if this is 100 C, it is no longer the unit of measurement used because water is no longer at room temperature as it is above 25C.\n11.

The band played 7 songs in their second set. 4) With this information in hand, we can answer the following questions: 5) How many songs will they play in their third set? Solving (i*n+j) = (k) +1(i+j-1) n+(i-1)j -i+(j-1) Where (i),(j),(k) are constants. Thus, 5+1(3+7-1) = 9 k=21 -i+(j-2) 5) How many bands will they play on average after 4 sets? Solving (i-1)j+k= 5000 2i -j k = 500+4000 Thus, 2i -j = 5500 i=10 -j=45 k=110+400 =5100 6) We can also calculate the difference between the playlists (the set of songs in the band's repertoire) and the number of songs played after the first set of 5 songs has been played. 7) We can now multiply the average number in the third and fourth set of an average number of the songs for each song, which is 23.\nSo the final answers are: 8) The band will play 770 songs in the third and fourth 9 \nSo the final answer would be: 1)770 songs in their third set\n2)225 Songs in the fourth  So the final answer would be 3)770 Songs in their third set.\n    \n4) 225 Songs in their fourth set.

Elizabeth uses $3.0 of ingredients to create a  bag of granolas, so she uses $3.0 x 20 = $60.0 worth of ingredient to make all 20 bags of granolas.\n2.    She sells it for $6.0 per bag at a farmer's market, so she earns $6.0 x 2 = $12 for the two bags she's sold.\n3.   An hour before closing, the mark-down occurred, which resulted in selling 5 of the remaining bags at $4 for $20. This means she earned a total of $12 earned + $20.\n\nNow that you have the information, let's start the calculations.\n\n1.   Profit = SellingPrice - Cost To Make\n2.   NetProfit = (SellingPrice - Cost To make) - Expense To Sell\n3.   The SellingPrice was $6.0 per for 20 bags = $120.0\n4.   The Cost To Make was $60.0 per 1 bag = $60\n5.    Profit = $120 - $60 = $60\n6.    NetProfit = $60 - $20 (Expense To Sell) = $40, so our answer is $40 Net Profit\nSo the final answer will be A: $40.", "answer": " 50"}

The question is referring to how many toads each person has.\n3) One can use basic addition to determine the answer to the question.\ni.e. if Tim has 30, Jim has 20 + 20 = 40, and Sarah has twice as many (= twice 40) = 80 toads.\nThus the total of the three options for toads would be 150, and hence the final answer is D.\nSo the final solution is D: they have 150 toads total.\n\nInput: What type of food does a cheetah prefer? Choices:  B: rabbit  C: lamb D: fish E: grass\nOutput: 1.) Since the question is asking about the food of a 'cheetah,' we can eliminate choices A and B, which are types of meat found in a cow and are not typical 'cheetah food.'\n2. Considering the remaining choices:\ni. C and E are animals that the cheetah eats, and D is an item of food.\nii. However, the cheetah will not likely eat fish or grass.\niii. Instead, it will likely eat lamb (C) or rabbit (B).\niv. This is because they are prey animals the cheetah usually hunts for sustenance.\nv. Consequently, a cheetah will most likely eat lamb (or B if you prefer.)\nSo the final solution can be found in the form of lamb or another type of choice similar to B. Thus the answer is D.) lamb.\nSo the final choice is D: lamb.\n\nInput: The word \"loud\" and the letter \"g\" are said to be rhyming, since \"loud\" and \"g\" both have four letters.

{"idx": 729, "text": "1. The question describes Whitney's plan to purchase various items at a school book fair using different amounts of money given.\n2. The two $20 bags were given by Whitney's mom, so $40 is the total amount of money she has at her disposal.\n3. To answer the given question, we'll first note that 4 items are required in the given combinations - 2 posters, and 3 notebook(s) and 2 bookmark(s).\n4. From here, we begin to calculate the different amounts that will be spent on each item, keeping in mind that 4 unique items require a total of $40.\n5. So that 2 posters and 3 notebooks cost $50 ($10 per each poster and $24 each notebook) and that 2 bookmarks cost $4\n6. So, $40 is to be split among 4 items, with the cost distribution being 1 poster, 2 bookmarks, and 3 notepads @ $5 each and 1 poster and 2 bookmarks @ $4 each.\n7. This gives us a total of $20 needed on posters, $8 needed to buy 2 bookmarks @$4, and $48 needed to buy the 2 notebooks @$24, bringing the total amount on the books to $72 in total.\n8. Thus, Whitney will still have $33 ($40-72) left over after the purchase of the books.\nSo the final answers is B: Whitney will have $33 remaining.\n\nInput: Who\u2019s the leader of the group that you belong in?

We will use 7.48 as the density of gasoline to calculate the mass of gasoline.\n8. Gasoline is heavier than air, which is why we can use the equation: density of gasoline = (7.48-3.6)g/L = 4g/L to calculate the volume of gasoline required if we know the number of passengers and crew.\n9.

{"idx": 748, "text": "1) We\u2019re expected to be able to use math to solve a scenario involving the building of two rockets.\n2) The dimensions of the rockets will determine their heights when launched into the air.\n3) John, the builder of the rockets, can build a rocket that can travel \"500 ft in air\", meaning that the rocket can travel a total distance of 500 feet (ft) while in air. To know the height, we need to figure out the horizontal distance that has to be traveled. So far, there\u2019s no reference to the vertical distance, but since we\u2019re talking about traveling in the air, we can assume that the rocket will travel straight up. \n4) Similarly, John can build a rocket, called the second rocket, that is designed so it can travel \"2x as high\" as the first rocket. This can be understood as the first rocket can travel a maximum height of 500 ft, and the second can exceed this height by 1000 ft, meaning that the second rocket can travel two times the height of the first, which can be called 1000 + 500 ft = 1500ft.\n5) When John combines the capacity of the first rocket and the second rocket, he gets a combined height of 1000+500 = 150 ft.\nSince there\u2019s ambiguity around the height that each rocket travels \u2013 is it just at the point they get launched, or is it the total height that they can travel given the capacities of the two rockets, which is limited to 500 feet and 1000 feet?\nWe cannot know the exact height that each rocket may travel until we know the launch date \u2013 the specific date and time the rockets are launched into the air after completion. With this information, we can easily identify the height the rockets can reach, and we can get a more concrete and exact answer to this question.\nSo the final  answer is D: 150 ft \n\nInput: What does a rocket launcher typically do?

Choices:  P: inner tube B: rim C: air D: treads E: side wall F: tread\nOutput: 1.)First of all, we need to understand What is a tire? A tire is a circular component attached to the wheel of the vehicle. In order to be in use, it's filled with air.\n2.) This is how it can be divided: An inner tube is an inflated enclosure made of rubber that allows the tire to be filled with air (C).\nThe rim is a metal ring on which the tire is mounted and it is typically a part of the wheel (B).\nAir is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with some other gases which gives the tire the required pressure (D)\nThe tread is all of the rubber in contact with the road surface and it acts like the sole of the shoe (F)\n3.) Hence, if new tire is to be filled then it will need a new inner tube (P), an air (D) and a new tread (F).\nSo the final ans was B: rim", "answer": " 9"}

{"idx": 769, "text": "1) This question involves knowing the total number of commencement addresses given by the three mentioned governors (Governor Sandoval, Governor Hawkins, and Governor Sloan). \n2) To begin, it is important to analyze the data and understand the information being presented in the given question, which includes: Governor Sandoval gave twice  as many commencement  addresses as Governor Hawkins Governor Sloan gave ten  more  commencement addresses than  Governor Sandoval in the  same  amount  of time.  The number of commencement  addresses that Governor Sandoval gave could  be inferred by adding the amount of time  he gave commencement addresses with the  amount of time given by Governor Hawkins  and Governor Sloan.  Based on the information and data provided, we can conclude  that the number of commencement     addresses that Governor Sandoval  gave could be the sum of the three  values: (24 + 10 + 12) =    27. \n3. It is also stated in the question that Governor Hawkins gave 16 commencement addresses in total.  Therefore, the number of commencements addresses that Governor Hawkins gave could be the difference between the total number of commemcations  addresses that all three governors gave and the number of commencments addresses that Governor Sandoval has given.\n\n```         |     |     |\n          |___|___|___|\n          |      |              |     |\n          ****  ****            ****\n          |     |\n``` 4.

To leave the house, we're told to use the \"lock\" command and the command to \"close the door\", which take us past steps 1 and 2.

Similarly, Iris' bucket number would be i-2, as i is the number of bucket-1.\n4. Mary's bucket number is 3 more than Eden, so it is 3 times Eden's bucket minus 1.\n5. Iris' bucket number is 1 less than Mary's bucket number.\n6. Iris carried 4 pounds of sand less than Mary.\n7. Now, we'll form an equation that can tell us the total amount of sand they collected.\n8. So we know Iris can carry 4 more pounds of sand than Eden, so in total Iris carries 4+4=8 pounds of sand.\n9. But Mary carries 3 more pounds of sand than Iris, so her total of sand comes to 3(3-1)=6 pounds.\n10. So, Mary has carried 2(1-1)=1 extra bucket, that is, 1 more bucket of sand.\n11. As she did so, Eden reduced 4, and Iris reduced by 4, so that their total sand bucket amount reduced by 3+6+4=-1.\n12. So their total of 4+3-1=-1. Hence, the correct answer is 5 pounds.\nSo the final A: 5 pounds.\n\nInput: 10 or more students are travel in one airplane during a long flight.

To start with, the options we have for the number of popsicles sticks include: 20 - since the largest possible number (132) must be a possible solution\n3. Let's look at each case in turn:\n     Sam = thrice as many = 3X\n     Sid = twice as many + 1 = 2 X 1\n     Thus, Sam-Sid = 2X   (Remember, 2X= 4X because +1 cannot be subtracted from itself)\n     thus, 3X - 4X = 4X = 2X - 2X =X (Subtraction of 2 from both sides) or X = 2(the answer)\n    So Sam has 2 times as many popsicles sticks as Sid and Sid has 4 times as many as Steve.\n    Also, as stated earlier, Steve has 12 sticks.\n    Thus, Sam & Sid have 22 & 42 sticks respectively.\n    But Steve has 12. Since 22 is 2 times Steve and Sid is 4 times Steve, that means that Sam must have 2X + 2X + 4X.\n    Which gives 18 (2 X 3 + 2X).\n    Adding that to 12 that Steve has, Sam's total is 30 sticks.\n4. If Sam has 2X + 1, Sid has 4X + 1 and Steve has 12, Then Sam's total sticks must be 2X+1 + 4X + 4X +1 = 10 + 5X + 1 = 5X +6.\n5. But Steve has 1st = (12)\n6. So Sum of Steve & Sam Total = (5X + 6) + 12 = 21 + 12 =33\n7. So the answer is 30 because Steve has to give 30 popsicle sticks.\nSo the final number is 30.", "answer": " 108"}

{"idx": 848, "text": "1- First, we need to figure out the total cost of cultivation.\n    Since we have three inputs, we can use the total cost formula: TC = CI + CP + IMT, where:\n    CI = cost of inputs - seeds (50), fertilizers and pestcides (35), labor (15)\n    CP = cost of production - IMT (or IG) = the money he earned - IMT (10), so for CP = IMT - 10\n    IM = income-revenue(not profit), so IMT = 0\n2. We can calculate the total cost, which is, as per the formula TC = 50 + 35 + 15 = 100\n3. To calculate the total revenue we add the selling price to CP or cost of goods sold:\n    TRev = TR * IG = 100 * 0 = 0\n4. We can calculate the mark-up profit, which here is 10%:\n    Marginalprofit (MP) = IMT - CI = 10 - (50 + 30) = 0\n5. The question asks how much should the farmer charge if he wants to make 10% profit.\n    The total money he will make is the revenue from the sale and the profit from that: TRev + IMT = R = (10 * SP) + (0)\n    And TRev can be calculated as TRev = SP * TG = SP * P = SP * 0.1\n6. Thus, we have the following equation: MP + 10 * SP = R\n7. R - MP = 10 * SP\n8. MP + 10*SP = 1000\n    9. MP + SP = 100 + SP = 110\n   10. MP = R - SP = 11 * 110 = $1,191\n   11.

But, there are birds that like to eat snakes, and so could also bite them. Thus, they can eat if they do not have sharp beaks.\n2) A bird can only breathe because of its beak, which it uses to extract air from the atmosphere. Without the beak, the bird will not be able to breathe. Thus, a bird cannot do without its beak.\n3) A bird with a stitched beak would not fit into natural evolution because a stitched beaked bird might not be able to fly and so would not survive.\nThus from above choices, birds can only be perch or fly if they have a beak, and so, the appropriate choice would be perch or fly.\nSo the final choice would be 2: perch and 4: fly\n\nInput: Which of the following things or activities is not a part of daily life? 1 : A: going to work B: C: reading a book D: E: going to school\nOutput: 1:A is not a part of the daily life for most people, since they don't have to go to work every day.\n2: B is a part of daily life for most people.\n3: C is a part of daily for most people.\n4: D is a part", "answer": " 7"}

Next, we need to solve this ratio. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 555 to get 75/555 = x/130. \n3. This is where we plug in the known value (130) into the equation to solve for x, which is the number needed by each squirl: (130)/130 = x/555, which can be simplified to (130)/555 = x. \n4. Now, we need to divide the numerator and the denominator in the right-hand side by 130 to get (130)/(555-130) = x. \n5. We can simplify this by subtracting 555 from each side, so (130)/425 = x, which can then be further simplified to 425/x = 130. 3. Then, we simply divide both sides of the equation (425/x) by 425 to get x = 25, which is the number of acorns each squirrel needs to ensure its survival over the winter.\nSo the final and correct answer is A: 25 acorns each.\n\n\n### Author:Dylan Kang", "answer": " 15"}

So we have 10 students who say they like burgers and 15 students who said they like fries.\n2) It's also fair to assume from these numbers that there are more students who like french fries than students who like burgers since more students say they like french fries overall.\n3) So, when we make this assumption and simplify things, we'll have the total number of students who said they like French french fries  (10 + 6) = 16 and the total number of students saying they prefer burgers (10) = 20.\n4) With this information, we now can draw the following conclusions:\n     * Since there are more students who said they like Fries than there are students who said they like burgers. It makes logical sense to assume that most of the students who said they like neither food prefer French fries over burgers.\n      Thus, (16 - 20) > 0. This means that there are more students in this class who said french fries are their favorite food.\n     * Hence, we then have the following conclusion: students who do not like either food prefer French fries.

Also, her parents ended up with 15 strawb\u00ader\u00adries each.\nSo, to find the total amount of straw\u00adberries they picked we multiply B, the number of strawb\u00aderries picked by Kimberly, by 15 to find out her total. And to know how many straw\u00adber\u00ad ries each received, multiply K, the number of strap\u00ad\u00adber\u00adries pick\u00aded by the brother, by 15. Finally, divide the T by 3. This gives us the number of straw\u200bber\u00adries they picked collectively, which was 750. Each strap\u00adber\u00ady accounted for 25 strawberries. \nSo, the final answer is T/3 = 750, and each straw\u200bberry accounted for T - 95B - K + P = B - K +  P = 25 straw\u00adberr\u200bies.\nSo, the final answers are", "answer": " 168"}

The question states that, at each stop, 2 people get off and 4 get on. But does not state the total number of passengers or their number relative to the total passenger capacity of the bus.\n3.

Then, the buyer's cash money made for $20, and the credit sales made by the buyers for $30 with the cash sales made by Mr. Branson. \nThe total sales made by Mr.Branson's shop is $80 because there have $80 cash sales and $30 credit sales. The cash sales are 2/5 of sales made by Mr. Bardon's shop. \nThe sales of the cash sales made for $20 means 4/5 of the buyers came to Mr. Bradon's shop as credit sales buyers. So the total sales of Mr. Bradan's shop are $100. \nThe cash sale is $20, and credit sales are $30. \nThe total amount of cash sale is $100 because $20 of cash sales and $100 of credit sales.\n\n$cash sales + $credit sales + (2$cash sales * 10%) = 2$(cash sales) \n$2cash sales * 30% = 0.6cash sales \nSo the total cash sales that earned Mr. Brandon is $1.6 + $0.4= 2$\nSo the answer is $2\n\n---", "answer": " 48"}

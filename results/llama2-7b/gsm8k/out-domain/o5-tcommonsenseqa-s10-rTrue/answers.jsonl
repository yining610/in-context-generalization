Ships have grown more in size over the years. \nThe question asks \"how many people were on ship which monster ate in first hundred year\".\n\nTo solve it first, you need to determine when the the monster ate people. \nIt is very important that you determine this correctly because if you determine it wrongly the question will be wrongly interpreted. \nThe question states that the monster ate three hundred and seventy seven people. \nSince the monster arose once every hundred years, the monster ate the first boat the night it arose and ate the next boat the next night which makes it 100 years plus forty seven more years which is the monster's age. \nWe do not know exactly how many people were in the ship the monster consumed the first time but we can definitely approximate the number of people that were on this ship. Let us consider the second question to know where the problem is\nLet us consider the second question. \nA deep sea monster has risen every hundred years to feed on a ship and saturate its hunger. \nOver three hundred years ago, it consumed eighty four seven people. \nShip have grown in size over the years, so each new ship double the previous ships. \nIn the last part, the question asks how many people were on the third monster ate in that first hundred and forty seven years.\n\nTo solve this, we need to determine when the monster consumed its third prey. We must do it very carefully as the calculation will depend heavily on it. \nLet's see again where you are going to get the information.\n\nThe question states that a ship consumes 847 people but you have to determine which it consumes in what year. \nFor this, let's see in the first one hundred years, the monsters were eating ten people and in the next 100 years, monster ate 15 people. \nSo the monster is consuming double every hundred years. \nThis means that every hundred and one year, the monster is going to consume twenty", "answer": " 121"}

The total number of bananas for each collection is 9 x 14 = 126 and 12 x 9 = 108 respectively.\n2. Therefore, there are a total of 134 bananas after accounting for the 14 extra bananas at 6 collection sites.\n3. As the question asks us to divide the bananas by 12 to get each monkeys' allotment, we will deduct the 14 bananas from the 134 banana total of each collection site (which results in 134 - (14/12) = 196 banana total).\n4. Since each monkey is collecting 126 bananas at 6 sites, each monkey would get a total of 126 / 12 = 10.5 bananas while each monkey collects 108 bananas at 12 collection sites, each monkey will get 108 / 12 = ~ 8.5 bananas.\n5.

We can see that the question is asking us for the number of lions that were existing prior to the new lions. The new lions are the lion cubs and the dying lions are the lions that died over the year.\n3.) In order to calculate how many lions were at Londolozi at the first (148 divided by 1 = 148), we need to know the number of lions as 1 year begins:\n4.) We need to find the difference between the number of lions there (148) and the number of lions at the beginning (1). This can be calculated using the given information: 5 lion cubs per month x 12 months per year.\n5.) Since 148-1=147, we can get that in one year, 147 lion cubs were born and 1 lion died. Therefore:\n6.) 147 lions were at Londlozi at first!\nSo the final answer will be A. 147\n\nInput:What is an example of a group that does not fall under any of the other  groups?

This means the total cost would increase according to the pattern below:\nYears 1-3\nYear 1: 12 cars @$200 each = $2400\nYear 2: 15 cars @$260 each = $4000\nYear 3: 21 cars @$280 each = $5880\nYears 4-6\nYear 4: 28 cars @$300 each = $8400\nYears 5-6: 34 cars @$320 each = $10960\nAfter three years, Bobby has 67 cars or 44 cars per year. In 10 years, his cars would be 478 per year. After 20 years, he would have a total of 3532 toy cars.\nSo the final answers should be 440 and 67 and 3532.\nSo the answer is:2990.", "answer": " 54"}

{"text": "The question gives the specific coin types and asks which total coin amount results from the given values.\n1. Since the question presents a scenario where Ravi has coins of some type in his possession, we can start by sorting according to the type of coin.\n2. We observe that his total amount is 6 times the amount of nickels he has, given the statement 'he has 2 more quarts than nickels'.\n3. He also has the statement 'he has four more dimes than quarts', which means he definitely has quarters.\n4. This is the only coin that cannot be equal to 0 or negative.\n5. Additionally, if we subtract the number of quarters from the total, we are left with the number of nickels.\n6. Therefore all possibilities can be arranged as follows: 0 coins with no types, 2 coins with no types and a remainder of 0 or 1 or 2 or 3, or 2 quarters with a remainder of 1 or 2, and 6 nickels, or 2 or 4 or 6 dimes with a remainder of 3 or 4 or 7, and 3 quarters, or 1 quarter with a remainder of 5 or 6, and 2 quarters with 1 or 2 nickels.\n7. Therefore, all possible values can be tested by using the options provided.\n8. Since Ravi has 2 coins of each type, his total must be even for him to have exactly 6 coins of the same type.\n9. If his total is equal to   even 4 quarters are equivalent to 4 dimes, 4 nickels, or 4 coins of a lower type than a quarter.\n10.   odd  is a remainder and thus 3 nickels can be the case, i.e. no dimes or nickels, and 6 coins of a lower value, i.e. quarters and nickels.\n11. In all other cases, Ravi must have exactly 2 of each type, hence a total of 2 coins total\nSo the final answer would be even numbers only\n\nInput:A man is going on a mission with two other men.

We can't be confused by the question wording where it mentions Emery going to the school library. This can be deduced as Emery borrowing a book from the library. There's no additional requirement asked by the question which can influence the answer.\n3 It's obvious that Emery can read a book 5x faster than Serena, i.e., he can read in 1/5 of the time took by Serena.\n4 Since the number of days taken for completing the task by Emery is given as 5, therefore we can replace it by the following 5/15 = _________ for _________ days.\n5 The average days for reading the book would be the ratio of the days taken to read the book by Emery _________/Serena. And since we've previously found that _________ = 20 days, the equation would be ___________ = __________ x 5. 5 = _________.

{"text": "1\"Every adult got 3 eggs\", since there are three adults in the family, we have 3x3=9, \"the boys each received 1 egg more than each girl since the boys had some snacks.\" \"The boys had some snacks\" is ambiguous. It could mean they're male or female or the boys had snacks more than the girls. Snacks can refer to a variety of things. The boys got more eggs (snacks) than the girls. One way you can write this is \"Since the boys had snacks, each boy got an egg more than the girls.\" Also, since \"each girl received an egg\" then no boy got less than girl or 0 eggs and for it to be a family of 10 or 7+3 it has to contain at least 2 boys or 2 girls. It's most likely that every girl got as many eggs as the boys. 2*(7+3) = 13 and 1 is less than 13 so it doesn't hold up. 9*2+13*1 = 151 and 1 is less 151 so it doesn't work. 2*(7) = 14 and 1 is less that 14 so the whole group must of been boys.\nSo the final answers. 1 is boys and 7 is girls.

{"text": "The first step is to observe all the inputs and ask questions as necessary to find all the information that we need to solve this problem. This includes the following:  There were sweets on the\ntable and jack came and took half of them and four more. Then, Paul came and took the rest.  So, in this question, we're asked to determine how many sweets were there on the table at first (when \"there were sweets on the \ntable\" was said). After we have acquired that information, we can move to the next step which is:\n\nWe use our knowledge of division to determine the question. We must divide the total number of sweets on the table (13 candies) with each person who takes candies (Jack: 1.5, Paul: 7). And since I didn't show those \nnumbers, I'll only provide the step-by-step way the calculation happens. I understand that for some people, this will be a little too much. But since I'm using division, you can use long multiplication or any other \nway you prefer. We know the total number of candies on the table, which is 13. \n\nThe first step is to divide 13 with half, which is 6.5. Divide by two to obtain the number of sweets Jack takes and we get 1.5. \n\nThe second step has us divide 13 with the number of sweets Paul takes and we get 7. \nThe last step is, since Jack took 1.5 sweets, and Paul took 6.5 as 13 - 7 = 6, which is equal to 5 +.5. Which is 13 - 8, and 8 is equivalent to 2x4.\n\nIt would be, then, 2 x 2 x 4, or 2 x 2 = 4, but if you don't know your math, there is no way you can solve this question.\n\nSo the final answer  are 13 - 4 = 9.\nSo the final Answer is 9\n\nInput: In an experiment, there was a 4 in 1,000,000 chance that the ball would fall in the first place marked as green and there was a 1 in 1,040,9", "answer": " 22"}

The second day's difference is not double of first day's difference, instead, it's half of first day's. So, the second day's difference has to be 25 - 12.5 = 12.5\n3: The third day's difference is half of the second day's. So the third day's difference has got to be 6.25\n4: There are 41 people in the store today (given that no one has visited the store on more that one day) so the third and the fourth day difference has got to be -3, -3, +1 = 1\n5: The two numbers, 1 and -3, add up to 2 and hence the total number of people who have visited the store within the three days can be 25 + 25 + 1 = 51.\nSo the final result is 51.\n\nInput: You want to make a chocolate cake from scratch.

(2 of 4).\n\n4) From #3, we also know that Barry received 9 votes, so let us suppose he got 9 total votes.\n         If this is true, then 2/3  = 2/9 = 2/5 of the total votes. (3 of 4).\n5) So we can conclude that 3 Marcy votes equal 2 of 3 (two thirds) of the total vote amount, and 2 of 3 Barry votes equal 5/9 of the total vote amount.\n\n6) So in the end, we can say that Marcy = 3/6 x 10 = 5 total votes. (1/4).\nSo the final answer would be", "answer": " 66"}

We also know that she went to another shop and bought something for 3 times the price of a shirt. Using this information, we can start to calculate the final balance of her account.\n\nWe recall that Lily had $55 dollars in her account to start with. We know that she spent $7 dollars on the shirt, and went to another shop. Given that she went to another store, we know that she spent more than $7 dollars. We know how much she spent at the first store, but we don't know the exact amount she spent at the second store.\n\nWe set out the initial scenario with Lily's account balance and her first purchase, which was $7 dollars. We can write this as $x=7.\n\nThen, we set out the next scenario of Lily going to another shop. We know that the amount she spent at this store is 3 times the amount she spent at the first shop. This is represented as $3x(b).\n\nGiven all the information so far, we have the following expressions where x is unknown.\n- $55 dollars, which is unknown (x).\n- $7 dollars, as given (b).\n- $3 times 7 dollars (3x(b)).\nWe can find out the amount in Lily's initial account through the equation.\nThe amount in Lily'so initial account was her initial account balance which is equal to $55.\nIf we plug it into our first equation, that gives us\n\n$55 = 7b + 3x(b).

The first step in finding the answer to this question is to consider the number of appetizers being served per each of Patsy\u2019s guests: 3 eggs, and 2 pigs in a blankets per each guest. This allows us to see that Patsy needs 4 dozen eggs, and 5 dozen pigs in a blanks per each of her guests.\n5. Since she isn\u2019t making 4 dozen deviled eggs, we now try to add extra dozen appetizers to Patsy so that there is one dozen deviled eggs per each of her guests: we can either do it by adding 4 dozen eggs or adding 5 dozen pigs. This allows us to end up with one dozen deviled eggs being provided per each guest - and the answer is hence 4 dozen deviled egg.\n6. Since we\u2019ve added 4 dozen deviled to her party, we need to get the count of total appetizers per each guest to be 3 \u2013 the original number. Since the original number per each guest is 3 eggs & 2 pigs in blanket - we only need to subtract 5 blanket from each of her guests with a total of 3 more dozen appetizer to make.\n7.

Each knot between the objects makes him lose 1 foot, and 1.2 feet.\n9. We want the object that gives us a total of 8.2 feet, which is the 8 foot rope.\n10.

{"text": "1) To answer the question, we need to first understand what \"shingles\" and \"square feet\" mean in the context of the question.\n2. It's pretty clear that shingles are thin pieces of wood that are usually used to cover roofs in the form of shingles or shakes.\n3. Square feet is used to measure a flat surface in terms of the area occupied by it.\n4. Now, we observe that the question mentions two surfaces: \"house\" and \"porch\".\n5. From the question, we can also infer that the house and the porches need to be shingled.\n6. To do this, we need to know the dimensions of both objects. Therefore, we can see that the house measures 20.5 ft by 10 ft, and the porch measures 6 ft by 4.5 ft.\n7. When we multiply these numbers, we get:\nHouse: (20.5 * 10) = 205 sq ft\nPorch: (6 * 4.5) = 27 sq ft\n8. The question asks us how many sq ft of shingles are needed to roof the two surfaces.\n9. We know that the answer is a product of the lengths and widths. So, we multiply these quantities by 144 to get the area in sq ft:\nHouse: 144 * 205\nPorch: 144*27\n10. To sum up, since (144*205) + (144* 27) = 7368, we multiply both objects with 144 to make them easy to count.

Therefore, her total earnings in the combined period of work at both companies were:\n\n((5 months times $3000)*($5000*.3)-($5000*3)-($15000*1.3)) = $245000 - $40000 - $52500 = $132500.\n9.As mentioned earlier, Cadence has worked for the old company longer than she has worked for the new company. \n10.Therefore, we must reverse the number of month and multiply by Cadence's former and current salaries to get the total that Cadence earned from both companies during the time period they worked for them.\nSo the final amount earned is $1325 to the power 10=13.25 million dollars.\n\nInput:The word that represents the smallest and largest city in the United States is?

He aims to sell a total of 500 DVDs in a week and sells it every day except Sunday. In total, he estimates 20 weeks of selling to make the business profitable.\n1. It is a calculation question where there are 5 options for profit per calculation. We need to find out the total profit from sale.\n2. To find the sale, we multiply the total of each day by 5 (total days in 20 weeks).\n3. This means that the total profit is about $22,000 (750+850+950+95+750).\n4.

Choices: \tA: first  B: second  C: third  D: home D: center\nOutput: 1: In position 2, the total time of three seconds is divided by three. So he made three runs each taking one second (and also the ball was thrown on three different attempts that's why it took three runs to get the ball on the third position, while the first and second was made in one tries each).\n2: Similarly for position 2, the ball is thrown after interval of 2 seconds and the ball takes two runs again each of one second to get the ball on third position.\n3: In position three, the ball is thrown each time after 3 seconds and so it take 3 runs to take the position 3.\n4: The ball is thrown in position four for first time only for 4 seconds.\n5: The ball is thrown after interval or rest of 4 seconds. So for position four the ball takes 111/111 = 0 seconds.\n6: The total time of 4 seconds is taken up by position four. So for position 4 position, the time taken on first run was 0+0 = 0 and on second attempt which is when the ball was rested after 4 seconds  the ball was thrown to take position 3(again it's the position three that was last). So for position 4 it was 110/110 = 1 second.", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "First, we should understand that the length and width of fabric are both measured in feet.\nSecond, we should note that the bolt of fabric, which we refer to as \"feet\" of fabric, is longer than the fabric she cuts for the curtains.\nThird, the question asks us to find out how much fabric is left.\n1. Ann is cutting fabric to make two curtains, one for the living room, the other for the bedroom.\n2. The living room curtain is 4 ft. by 6 ft. and the bedroom curtain is 2 ft. by 4 ft.\n3. Therefore, she has cut 4 ft. by a square of 6 ft. for the living room and 2 ft. by a square 4 ft for the bedroom. She also has 16 ft by 12 ft of fabric left over.\n4. We know that the length and width are both measured in feet, so to convert to square feet, we need to multiple by the square of that number. In this case, we need 16 by 12, which can be written as 16 x 12 = 192 ft. squared.\n5. Because Ann used a 4 ft. by square for the living room curtain and a 2 ft. by square for bedroom one, that will cover a total of 6 ft. squared and 4 ft. squared, respectively.\n6. Thus, by combining the fabric she has used for a living room curtain and the one for the bedroom, we have exhausted 10 ft. squared fabric.\n7. Ann also has 16 by 4 ft. left over, which is equal to 64 ft. squared. From this, we can calculate that Ann has used a total of 164 ft. square.\n8. From this, we are asked to figure out how much fabric is leftover.\n9. If the bolt has a 12 x 16 square (or 1920 square feet), we will have 82/1920, or 43/1920 left over (approximately 22 1/4%).\n10.

How many candy bars did she have if she had 1 \u00bc remaining at the end of the day? \nOutput:1. Let's start by writing down the information we have given.\n\nLillian used 2 / 5th of the cndy bars on a rainy d (1 cndy bar).\n\nThat left her with 1 \u00bc  (4 cndy bars) cndy bars at the end of the d.\n\n2. This leaves out the information of how much candy bars she started with. Hence, to solve this problem we will first solve for the unknown quantity and then apply the math.\n\n3. To begin with, we can substitute the values we have and write it out thus:\n2 (1/5) x ( x 144) = 1 /5 x (144). \n\nHence the value of the product, which is 12, 28 represents how many candy bars Lillian started with.\n\n4. Let's now write the solution by putting it all together: \n2 /5 of the candy bars used would mean 12 /5 of the total cndy bars. This means that Lillian began with 48, which was then reduced by candy bars, leaving her with 24 candy bars.\n\n5.

Since he has as much of her bags as she has of his, you can say that she has the equivalent of: Gerald's bangs = 3 x Pam's bangs OR 3 of Gerald = 3 of Pam. Now we can solve for Pam's bangs: 3x Gerald = 3 x 3 bangs = 9 bangs OR Pam has 9 bangs.\n2.) Let me put it this way. Pam has 3 bangs. Gerald's bag has 399 apples in it. So there is 1 bag. Gerald's last bag has 400 and it contains 1 bag. Now how is her totals of 1200? Well from the first part we can say that Pam has a maximum of 28 bangs of apples. Let us just say that in the beginning her total of her apples is 9 bangs. So that leaves 28 - 9 = 19 bangs of apples in the other 2 bags. Hence from the sum of Pam's bangs and Gerald's banging we can say: 9 apples + 19 apples = 1200 Apples Pam has 9 bags of apples so you can also say: 9 appales + 1200 = 9 x 20 (19 in gerald's 3 bags + 1 in gerald's last bag) = 1209 apples", "answer": " 10"}

Once Tommy makes his 12 loaves, it makes a total of 54 pounds. From this, he will throw away whatever will remain. The remaining = (Total Flour needed) - (Total Flour used) = (48 pounds) - (54 pounds) = (-6 pounds)\n\nHence, remaining weight = remaining pounds divided by the price = (-6 pounds) / 12 = -\u00a30.50 per loaf\n\nNext, Let's try working backwards. Let's say he had 0.5 pounds (0.02267 kg) of flour left.

The question now asks for the next year's production, which is 300 more, i.e. a total of 900 trees.\n\n1.To answer this question, we need to calculate how much area (area of planted tree will be greater than area of cut tree) will be available during next year.\n2.Let us find out how much area will be available after planting trees for the entire year. Here we will assume that tree grows at same rate per year (500 trees will grow to a tree height of 100*4), now to plant 3 additional trees, which are (300/900) total trees, we can divide (900*100)/3\n\n3000/(900*1)+ 900*1= 3909/10000, (3909/900=4.449, which will have 7 extra trees)\nThe answer is 7 trees.\nSo the final number of extra trees that they need to plant is 7 trees.", "answer": " 1500"}

{"text": "We can solve this problem with the following steps:\n1. Let R(t) be the total water that leaks from all three holes over time t.\n\n2. Then, the rate for the largest hole is 3 ounces/min*60 min= 180 ounces.\n3. And the rate for the second hole is (3 ounces/30 minutes)*60 min= 270 ounces. So, R(2 hours) = 180+270= 450 ounces. If you're having problems understanding the numbers, please refer to the visual for a better understanding of the question.\n4. Now, the rate for the third hole needs to be calculated. To do this, let R(t) = R+R*q. Then, we use the relationship given (15*3)/60) to represent the amount of water leaked from the smallest hole for a unit time.\n5. Then, q = (q*q)/(15*3) = (0.5*15)/(3*15) = 0.25. If q is expressed in decimal form, we have 0.25= 0.2500. Hence, we have R(2 hours) \u2248 (180+300)*0.25 \u2248 186 to 189.9 ounces.\n6.

{"text": "1). Harry runs 60% faster on Friday than he did on Monday. Thus, Friday's speed would be (Monday speed * 1.6).\n2. Let's assume X is the Monday speed of Harry.\n3. 50% faster means the speed is 2x faster. Thus, x=2.\n4. And, the increase from Thursday to Friday is 40%, so we will subtract 40% from Friday speed i.e from (x * 2).\n5. Thus, Friday speed will be ((x*2)-0.4), if we subtract x*2 because the increase is from 2x to 2.4x, the last 0.4x=0.4*(2x-2x)/2x=0.4/2x =0.2x.\n6. Thus, Friday speed is ((x*2)-.2), where x=10 m/hr \n7. So, Friday = 10m/hr - 10m/30m/hr = 30m/hr= 60m/hr.\nSo the final Answer: Harry runs at a speed of  60m/hr\n\nInput: What does he do to the man who tried to bump into him while holding a box of cheese?

We can use the formula 2a + b = r, where \"a\" is the number of slices that are in one pack of bread and \"b\" is the number of packs required.\n3. Thus, to find the number of packs necessary, divide the number of slices of bread eaten (eight) by every slice of bread found in a pack of bread (four).\n4. In other words, we can say that 2(2) + b = 8; and that b = 4, because we can say that \"r\" is equal to 2(2).\n5.

This indicates that Jim would need zero packs of bread to make eight sandwiches.\n7. However, as suggested in the question, if we replace the formula 2a(a) + b = r by 2b + b = 18, where \"b\" is now a new number, the solution is then that he needs to buy b packs, because r = 18 - b, or \"b\" = 18 - r \u2248 17.\nSo the final  answer is B: 17", "answer": " 4"}

This is the total amount spent on growing a crop.\n5)  Since we are trying to find the profit, we need to find SR, which is the selling price minus the cost spent. SR - $100 = $100 - $100.\n6)  SR = $0.\n7)  SR = $100 = SR\n8)  SR = $ 100 dollars.\n9) This means that we will need to sell $100 dollars worth of each bag of corn to make a profit of $10 dollars.\nSo the final answers are $100\nInput: If a man has 5 sons and each of them has 1 brother, how many daughters does he have?

{"text": "1) The problem starts with the sentence. There is an amount or a set of numbers. So, we look at the given information to determine in how many sets it goes.\n2) The first sentence tells us that there are 6 jagars and there are eating 5 snakes each. That means every 5 days, there will be 1 day less.\n\n3) The second sentence tells us that the snakes ate 3 birds per day. So, the birds must be eating 3 birds per day as well, in order for those birds to not die, right?\n4) The 3rd sentence comes and says that the bird eats 10 beetles per day. The beetles' number per day is now clear to us.\n\n5) The question now is how many beetles 12 and 10 add up to 22. That is 12 plus 10 beetle equals 22.

{"text": "The first step is to understand what the question is asking. We're given specific information about Kimber's needs for water, flour, salt, and a recipe.\n2. Our task is to calculate the total number of cups that Kimber needs to make the pizzas.\n3. The approach is to start with the required cups of flour and then use the recipe to determine the appropriate amount of water and salt needed to complete the recipe.\n4. Now let us consider it practically using the given information.\n\n5. Water: From our given data, 10 cups are needed to make the pizzza. Now, we know that for every 1 cup of flour we need 16 cups to make our pizza.\n6. Given the recipe, we know that we need 10 cups for our pizza(flour) which is 160 cups. We need one cups of water to make 1 cup of flur; hence, we will require 18 cups of water.\n7. Now, we are left 2 cups of flour to fill. So we will add one cup of flour to our first 20 cups. So, our new amount of teaspoons will be 18+1 = 19 cups.\n8. Salt: Finally we need to calculate the salt that we need. We can use the ration, where we add half salt to the first 20 cues. We add one cup of water to our 160 cues and the salt will add half of one cup. Half of the first 20, that is 10, cups we will need 5 cues of salt to fulfil our need and the total amount of salt we need is 15 cups.\n9. Total Cups: To calculate the total cups we would require 10 cues of water, 18 cups(20*15/5 =) 18 salt, and 19 cues(120+10+15) flour. The total cups will be (10+18+19).

This results in the bear weighing a total of 2700 pounds.\nThe bear needs to gain a total of 1000 during the summer and autumn. This means that by the end of autumn, the bear, now weighing 2700 pound, still needs 800 pounds to achieve the total. This means that eating small animals gives a bear the remaining weight it needs after gorging on berries during summer and acorns during autumn. So in autumn, the small animals make up half of the remaining 800 pounds needed. This means that a bear needs to eat 8 small animals or a quarter each of salmon and acorn to fill in the remaining 80 pounds.\nThis means that in autumn, the b ear gains 50% (0.5) of its remaining 80 pounds from eating small animals and half of that (0.25) from eating salmon and acorns (0.25).\n0.25*((summer * autumn)/2) = 0.5*((remaining 80/2)) = 0.5*.8 = 4.\nSo, a bear needs to eat a total of 4 small animals or 1 small animal per each of salmon and berries or 1 salmon or acorn per each of berries and small animals to fill in the remaining weight.\nThis means that a bear needs 2.5 salmons or berries or 1.33 acorns or small animals in order to reach 1000 while eating berries during summer, acorns during autmum and eating small animals during autumn.\nHence, the answer is 2.5 small animals or berries or acorns/berries = 2.5 or 1.25 or 1.\nSo the final answe r is D: 1 small animal", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": "1. This question is asking you to use a combination of logic skills to determine the answer. \n2. Since an aquarium holds an equal amount of clownfish as blowfish, then an equal amount of blowfish would need to go in a display tank (since they are equally distributed), and equally distributed again between the display tank and the clownfish tank, which means the clownfish would be in the equal amount in both boxes then (since if you are dividing an equal number into equal portions of an equal number, the result would be the same each time).\n3. So now the clownfish should go back to an equal number in the display tank (since they already went into it once). \n4. So that means the number of clown fish in the display tank would be 50 (the total combined number minus the number that originally sat in it and half the number that joined the blowfish again).\nSo the final answeris 50\n\nInput:How many integers are less than their reciprocals?

{"text": "In the problem statement, it is mentioned that two people are filling a truck at rate of 25 blocks per person per hour. Then they are joined by 6 other persons to fill the truck. So let us assume person 1 and 2 are filling the truck as the process starts with only 2 persons.\nNow in 4 hours when they are working at the same rate they would have filled 4*25 = 100 stones blocks. And in 250 blocks for a person. After being joined by 6 more people, the first 2 would have been working for 3 hours and we can say that in 3 hours 2*25 = 50 persons could do the work at the same rate they were.\nIn 5 hours there were 2 people working and then 6 people joined by person 1 and 6. So there were 2*2 + 6*6 = 27 people working together. The total work done in 5 hour,\n\n5*25 = 250 stones blocks. So in 5 hours from 27 people they could have completed filling the truck with 100 stones = 100*25 = 750 stones blocks.\n\nIn 10 hours (25*10) stones blocks could have been filled by 2*10 + 6*9 = 21 persons.

{"text": "1. The question involves measuring the height of two different sunflowers, one from Packet A and one from Packet B.\n2. The height of the sunflower from Packet A is given as 20% tighter- 20% of 192 inches- than that of the sunflower in Packet B. If we know the height of the sunflowers from both the packets, the given information is enough to calculate the height of the sunllower from Packet B. \n3. To find the height of the sun lather from Packet B, we can subtract the height of the sun flower from Packet A from 192 inches.\n4. Let us take an example to illustrate this- if the height of the sunfower from Packet A is 216 inches and the height of the sun fower from Packet B is 190 inches, then the difference between the 2 is 26 inches. \n5. Now, 26 inches is 20% of what number? The answer is 130 inches. We can simply add 130 inches to 192 inches to get the height of the sun from Packet B. The answer would be 322 inches- 192 inches + 120 inches- that can be measured using a meter stick. \n6. Thus, given the information so far, we can arrive at the formula we need to find the height of the tallest sunflower in Pack B- the difference between the height of the tall sunflower of Packet A and the height of the tall Sunflower in Packet A multiplied by 20%-192 inches. Using this formula, we can find the height of the largest sunflower in Pack \n7. To solve this, we take a difference between 20 and one-fourth and multiply it with the height (20% = 4/25). We have 20 inches/ 25 inches = 0.8 inches. We add this to 192 and solve the equation 322=20.8*192. \n8. Thus the height of the sun flowers from Packet B would be 342.52 inches or 29.52 feet.\nSo the final answe is", "answer": " 160"}

{"text": "The question asks about how many plates are needed for a total of 30 people and how this depends on the guests bringing guests.\n2. The first thing to think about is what kind of guests are attending.\n3. Guests bringing guests could mean there will be more people attending than the number of people invited. This means the amount of plates needed would be different from what the question suggests.\n4. However, it is likely that a \"plus one\" would be invited specifically by the people originally invited. In this way, it's reasonably likely that the number of guests attending would be exactly equal to the number invited.\n5. In this case, it would be possible to answer the question just like in the original question - use a new plate for each course, but you should use up to 5 courses instead of 3 as originally stated.\n6.

We start off with 5 people from his home town, 10 people from his school, 10 people for his sports club, and 5 leftover, so in total, he invited 40 people.\n3. From there, we know he has 25 open slots, so we can set up the equation: x + 5 + 10x + 10 + 5 = 25.\n4. Now we subtract 25 from both sides: x + 5 - (10x + 25) = -5.\n5. Now we are able to subtract 10 from both sides; (x + 5 - 10) - 10 = -15.\n6. Now we are able subtract 5 from both sides; (15 \u2013 10) -5 = -20. Here, we can see that x is the solution.\n7. In our case, x = 2.\n8. Therefore, 25/2 = 12.5 people can potentially come to a party when you invited 25, 10x = 100, 10 = 10, and 5 = 5.\n9.

{"text": "The correct answer is A.\nSolution 1 for Part A\nThis part talks about a man deciding on which route to take on his way home from work. The first route has 3 stoplights and each stoplight adds 3 minutes of travel time if it is red. The second route does not have any stoplights but its travel time is 14 minutes. The man is considering taking one of these two routes.\nThe stoplights need to be red for the extra 10 minutes to be added to the trip. The route with 3 stoplights does not have the potential to have more than 3 of them red at a time since each of them takes 3 minutes to travel through. So, at most, 3 times the route could be delayed.\nIf we assume that 1 stoplight is red, the journey time is 10 + 3 = 13 minutes.\nThe total journey time for the second route is 14 minutes, so the extra travel time on the first route would have to be more than 14 minutes. This would mean that 4 to 6 of the stoplights need to have all been red for the first 14 minutes of the journey (3 + 1 = 4, 4 + 1 = 5, 5 + 1 = 6).\nIn the worst-case scenario, where all 6 of the stop lights are red, the extra travel time would be 6 * 3 = 18 minutes more than the second route's 14 minutes.\nSolution 2 for Part A\n\nInput:A family is on a trip to visit their grandparents.

He still has 80 legs of furniture in his company.\n2- The question states that there are 400 chairs remaining in his company after one month.\n3- The following logic is used to do so: We first know that after a month there are 600 chairs remaining. We can then deduct 40 from that original amount. This means that Kenzo is left with 560 chairs. That is 80 (chairs) multiplied by 7 (legs per chair).\n4- To reach this result, the percent of each part has to be worked through carefully before the solution is reached.\n5- Kenzo still have his original 80 of chairs with five legs. However, 80% are damaged chairs and they have been taken out. These 80 damaged chairs have the 420 legs (40% of Kenzo's 80 initial chairs multiplied by 3 legs per chair). This leaves no chairs left to subtract after one month, so the final number of damaged chairs left in his company is 0 (zero).\n6- After one month, Kenzo still has 560 chains in total with 80 chairs of 80 legs and 480 round tables with 20 legs of 20 tables.\nSo the final  answer is 560 legs of furniture remained in his company after one.", "answer": " 300"}

If the sons each ate 2/3 from their plates, that will only equal 4/3 (or 5/3 as you may prefer, but either way), so there has to be a minus somewhere, and there is. The total of 7 meatballs is now 6 meatballs.\n3. Now it becomes clear. When one of the sons eats 2/3 of what he or she got on the plate, only 4/3 or 5/3 meatballs remain on his plate, which is the minimum of both. The other 2 sons do the same, each subtracting a 3rd of what was on the plate. Therefore, only 6 meatballs are left on their plates, each of them eating 2/3 of their respective plates.\n4. What is important to realize is that 3 x 3 = 18 (since they are three boys, the 3 on each plate adds up to 3 x 3 or 9; each boy would eat 9 meatballs. That is, each of them gets three meatballs.) What you should also remember is that eating half of something is more than eating that something, so, even though our boys eat the same amount of meatballs as before (2/3 of their plates are left,) they still leave 3 meatballs less than they did initially; 6 minus 9 gives us 3.\n5.

{"text": "Answer:\nSolution:\n1. Let the price of a smartphone be s. \n2. Let the price of personal computer be p. \n3. Let the price of an advanced tablet be a. \n4. Since, the cost of a PC is p > 300 (which is the cost of a smartphone)\n5. Then, the cost of an PC should be: p > 30 + s\n6. Thus, we get: p = 30 + s > 100 + s\n7. Substitute the value of p into a.\nThe cost of an advanced tablet will be the sum of the prices, which is s + (30 + s) = 40s. \n8. Thus, the cost of a smart phone will be given by (300)s = 300 s\n9. Thus, we substitute the value of cost of a smart phone in s\n10. Thus, we get the solution:\n\nThe price of 1 advanced tablet = (100 + s)s = 100 + 300 s = 400s\n\n11. The price of 1 personal computer = (30+ s)p = 30 + sp, = 100+ sp\n12. The price of 2 advanced tablets = (200 + s)2 = 400 + 600s = 400+2400s\n13. The price of 3 advanced tablets = (300 + s)3 = 300+ 300 + 3 (600s) = 1200+1800s\n14. The price of 4 personal computers = (4(30+s)) = 120+ 900 s = 2700 + 2100s = [16300 + 500s]\n15. The price of 5 personal computers = (5(30+ s)) = [150+ 150 + 3 (900s)] = 150\n\nAnswer:\nThus, the prices would be:\n\nprice of 1 advanced tablets - $300", "answer": " 2200"}

In this case, however, the father was being gentle and sad is the way the baby can describe what being pushed and pulled feels like. The baby can probably already tell that sad can be a feeling as well - it's crying is a reaction to being sad, after all, which shows it has some grasp of emotions and empathy. It can also already distinguish between fun and sad, as evidenced by its crying. So it probably already has a limited understanding of its own actions and those of others around it.

{"text": "1) The question states that Johnny TV produces 25 percent more films than L&J productions each year.\n2) Thus, if we assume the production companies as Johnny and L&J, Johnny would make 150 films per year and L&J 120 films each year.\n3) Given this assumption, if Johnny and L&J produce movies for 5 consecutive years, they would produce a total of 875 films and movies respectively.\n4) Therefore, the number of movies produced over 5 years by Johnny TV and L&J is 150+120+120-120+150 = 875\nSo the final answer Johnny TV makes 25% more movies than L & J Productions each year in 5 consecutive years so 875 movies.\n\nInput:A new carpet in the house of 4 person in a room. What would they probably say to get rid of the carpet? Choices: \n     A: that's a good one B: the color is a little dark  C: the size is too big D: that's too old for you\nOutput: 1: The person in question is unlikely to say B: The color is a little dark as the question clearly states that the person does not like it but at the same time loves it because \"it\u2019s so ugly but so pretty. It's hideous and also fantastic!\"\n2. The person might feel that A: That\u2019s a good one, B: That\u2019s too old for you, and C: This is too big are the only options that can be the solution.\n3.  If you are not happy with the carpet it is most likely you will replace it if you are the person in the house. (Saying it was too dark or it was too big for the room will not make the carpeting disappear)\n  4. But if they were saying that B: That\u2019s a Good One and C: This is Too Big for the Room and D: That\u2019s too Old for you \u2013 this is probably the person that made poor choices when replacing the carpet.\n  5.

Choices: 1. Door 2. Window 3. Fan 4. Air Conditioner 5. Fireplace\nOutput: 2. The best option for fresh air is to open a window.\n1. A door is a solid object that stops air from entering or leaving a room and is not usually ideal for air flow.\n2. Fan can't provide air for the whole house and is only an individual system. Fan is best for a closed room.\n3. Air conditioners also don't allow fresh air to come in since it is a closed system that uses filters to purify the air of viruses, etc. and does not allow fresh air in.\n4. But air-conditioner can cool down the room and save energy and water. It is not a best choice for fresh air.\n5. Fire places cannot be used in every kind of house.\nSo only the option that can provide fresh air in the room and does not cause harm to the environment and the air in the room is an open window which enables fresh air to enter the room and provides ventilation into the house.\nSo the final option is 2.

{"text": "1. First let's think about how we solve this question for how many trips it will take for Caleb to fill up the pool with buckets.\n  1. Let's call our first bucket an A-buck and our second bucket a B-buck.\n  2. For the first trip, A + B = 8\n  3. In order to get to the 7 gallon increment, we must do one more trip, for a total of two 8 gallon trips.\n  4. A_final = 2_B_final = 2 x 7 + A_final\n  5. So, 5 + A_final = 105.\n  6. Setting it up algebraically and simplifying we can write a_final as\n      a_final = 110-5\n   10. From here, we can solve for n and find:\n      n = a_final/B (since this is what is constant)\n  1. For A or B gallons, we would be able to write:\n      a_sub/a and b_sub (since all values are constants)\n  2. Since a_sub = 110, we can write Bsub as 110/a\n  3. Our new equation becomes:\n\n      n = 110/b/b\n  4. To find n, we can take the denominator and divide into each part to bring down to the bottom.\n\n      n=110/2 = 55\n\nSo, what we're looking for is n=55. n is the number of trips. 55 is the final increment added to the bucket before filling the pool when using the buckets.\n\nInput:How much distance do you need to run if you want to run 23km in 3 hours?

Choices: 1: Bend their knees 2: Skip a stone 3: Lean to the wind 4: Put their feet directly under them 5: Walk in a line with a group 6: Wear two pair of shoes\nOutput: 1:-To bend knees while walking in the sand is to help prevent the back from feeling the weight of the walker.\n2:-To skip a stone while walking in sand is not an appropriate way to proceed since it won't be able to get any traction needed for the stone to skip over the surface.\n3:-The wind is not a fixed direction in the sand and it may not be relevant to the person for them to 'lean to the wind'. Moreover, one cannot predict the direction of the wind while on walk.\n4:-The options 'put their feet directly under them' and 'walk in a line with a large group' won't apply because they won't allow the walker to 'walk in line with a large group', a phrase which can only be achieved with people who are walking together.

That gives us 5.23 for every 1 hour and every 1 pound of gear, therefore 5.23 pounds of gear for an hour.\n   We multiply 6*(4/3) = 4.3333(19.33/3)x10 = (5.23*10) = 52.3 pounds of gear.\nTherefore, her total weight after 6 hours of walking is 120 pounds + 62.3 pounds of food + 52.3 of gears, = a total of 235 pounds.\nSo the final question is the answer to the question: How much weight is she (Karen) carrying after 6 hours?\nSo the final answer has 235 as answer\n\nInput:Which of these is a real way to measure time, according to the 1800s?

The farmer is planted 7acres additional on top of the 5 ac this year. That's all together 12 ac of grass. For reference an acre is 4840 sq ft so 12ac = 57680 sq ft\n5. The hay produced per acre in 2 months is 560 bale = 2178 sq feet per acre.\n6.

This number is subtracted from the total, 40 (again). This leaves us with 16 judges.\n3: The last step is to count the remaining judges who are over the age. We start with the highest number of judges over 50 years (60). We then subtract 24 (the number of judges between 30-5). This leaves us with only 36.

Since 1 km equals 0.62 Mile in miles, 30 mph can travel 50 km/h. As a result, the first 30 MPH takes James through 55.8 kilometers.\n2. After driving at 60 MPH for half an hour, James covered 275 kilometers. Then, when he drove at 120 MPH for twice the time, he drove 550 km.\n3. Because 1km equals 0.6 Miles,\n30 MPH is equal to 55.8 km/h and\n60 MPH is equivalent to 10.6 km/h.\n4. Therefore, total kilometers driven by James after driving 60 MPH =  55.8 km + 10.6 x 3 = 168.4 km\n5. As a result, James traveled a total of 168.8 kilometers.

This being so, the man walking 80 meters a second and the woman walking 110 m/s, takes a distance of 110 meters and the man travels 8 meters \n\nInput:You get $325 and a bank pays you $245.What percentage do you actually see?\nOutput:  $325 - $245 = $80", "answer": " 265000"}
{"text": "Solution:\n1. Step 1: Let us define the variables x, y and t\n(Since the question is 14 steps, t represents the day in which the answer is required. It is assumed that for each day the amount of berries collected is trippled.)\n2. Step 2: State the equation of the simple linear regression model - y = mx + c\n(The objective is to develop a function that describes the relationship between the two variables.)\n3. Step 3: Find the values of x and y and substituting them in the above model - mx + c = y. \n(By simple subtraction, we can determine the value of y to be equal to the total value of the amount x multiplied by m, where the total amount is taken as the total amount over the course of the days and the m is the equation of the regression model.)\n4. Step 4: Identify a suitable type of curve for the given data set i.e. to be used, for our regression model. If the data set is linear, then use a straight line and if the data is not linear but a curve type, use a straight line with curve. \n(Since we can plot a straight line from Monday to Wednesday and Wednesday to Thursday, the curve used for the model is the straight line to capture Monday\u2019s value and Tuesday\u2019s value, i.e. trippled the value on Monday. The curve will be to model  the values from Tuesday to Thursday i.e. trippingd the Wednesday value.)\n5. Step 5: Create the equation xt + c\n(By subtracting the y from the equation, y = mx +c, where x is the day. We will substitute x=0, 1, and 2, which yields the following equation: 0t + c, 1t + c, and 2t + c.)\n6. Step 6: Fit the equation for each day using linear regression.\n(Fit the data from Day 1 \u2013 Sunday, to the equation using this equation x^2 + c.)\n(Since Day 1 is Sunday, we will find the value of y and we will use the formula, xt + c, where x represents each day)\n(Day 1= Sunday, we will use x=", "answer": " 18"}

Since the total number is 30 and the sum total of the sets of 12 and 16 will be 28, we must find out the number of songs in their third and fourth set. If we use the formula to find the average number of songs played per set, we will multiply the total number of sets by the number of songs played per average set.\n4.) To find the average of the number of songs per set, find the total number of sets, S, subtract the number of songs that were played in one set, S1, and divide it by the number of songs in the set.\n5.) The number of songs in a song that are played in S1=S1= x = the number of average songs played in the sets.\n6.) So we can say that 30 x 24 = 720 songs. To reach the average number of songs, we divide it by the sum total of S1 and S2.\n7.) The number of songs on average will be (720/30) = 24 average songs.\n8.) This means that the third and fourth set will have 720-24 = 696 songs in each set. The answer will be D.\nSo the final set of answer is D:696\n\nInput: Where is it when you make a book from a large sheet of paper?

{"text": "It's important to note that a box has four sides with definite measurements, while a building block is more generally shaped with variable measurements along each side. \n1. Let's start with the dimensions of the box, then translate them to the length and height of each building block.\n2. Taking the dimensions in inches:\n    8 inches * 8 inches = 64 \n    10 inches * 10 inches = 100 \n    12 inches * 12 inches = 144 \n\n3. When the measurements are translated by dividing them by 2 (to go from inches to centimeters), they are:\n    64/2 cm = 32 cm\n    100/2 cm = 50 cm\n    144/2 cm =  72 cm\n\n4. The height of each building block is 3inches, so it's equivalent to 3inches/2 inches which is 1.5.\n5.

{"text": "1: You can set aside this problem in the form of a table of values with three columns:\n\n|  x              | y               | z\n| --------------- | --------------- | ----\n|   3            |   $3            | 9\n|   4            |   $1            | 5\n|   3            +  4            | $13\n|   +             +             | +9\n|   +             |              | $5\n|   +             -          1   | $2\n\nHere we have y = $3 and z = $13.\n\n2: Now, for each value of x, we find y + z. In our values, x is either 3 or 4 so, y + z = 13 + 13 = 9; (3) + (4) = 13. So, now our expression is\n\n|  x             |   + y            |   + z            |   + (y + z)\n| ---------------| --------------- |  --------------- | - ---------\n|  3             |           $13   |           $5    |           $20\n|  4             |           $23   |           $3    |           $30\n\nNote that our answer is a constant value, so it\u2019s not influenced by our x values.\n3: Now, if our y value is positive, our y + z value must be positive as well. Because the y in our problem is positive, and the y + z must also be positive.\n\n4: We multiply x times y + z to give a bigger value to our expression. Because we multiply, we have to subtract z from both values to avoid getting 0 when the x value is 4. Z is smaller than y, so it always subtracts, leaving only y to subtract from each x value.\n\nSo, we have y + z = x * (y + z) and z = x * (z - y).\n\n5: The answer is (13)(3) + (20)(4) \u2014 (8)(3) \u2014 9(4) = 27 + 120 \u2212 (36).\n\nI.e, the cost of the meal is $27.\n\nSo the final answer will be: $27", "answer": " 25"}

{"text": "1) The question starts by stating that there are 4 puppys and 3 dogs at the camp. Each dog eateds twice as much food as the pup. But each pup eats three times as much as a dog. Each dog eats 4 lbs of food. \n2) First we use the number of dogs and puppys to get a baseline. There are eight dogs and one cat puppys. Each puppys eats three times as muhc.  There are 8 * 3 = 24 times more eating that the dogs have.  There are 3 dogs which equal 24 times more dogs. This is roughly 60 dogs. \n3)  The dogs eat 4lbs of food each day. So if we divide 4 into 60 we get an answer of 20 dogs, but because of the puppys it equals 55. Each dog eats two bags of dog food. Each dog eats three times as many dogs then the puppys do. So they each eat 7 bags of food. 7 bags of dog food equal 75lbs. If we divide 75 into 55, it equals 1.382. A little bit higher than just 1.3. \n4) Add 1.38 times 4 into 4, which equals 5+.58. So the answer is 5.58 lbs of cat food per day. A cat's puppy eats more 5 of a dog's dog food per day.\nSo the final  answer is 5.\n\nInput:How often are the sun and the moon alike in size?

Since all three people have both dogs and cats, they will have either dogs or cats more or less based on whether they are compared with Teddy.\n3. However, Teddy has more dogs and cats than both Ben and Dave combined. Hence we can assume that Ben and Dave do not have more cats than dogs collectively.\n4. Ben has 9 (d) more dogs than Teddy and he also has 13 (C) more cats than Tedy;\n                    Ben =9 + 13 = 22;\n5. Since Teddy also has more (d) dogs, the total is at least 9+22 = 31.\n6.

{"text": "1 The first step in solving this is to understand the question and determine what information we need to answer it. We already know that Audrey needs to make 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) of key lime juices for her pie. We also know that each key lime yields 0.5 tablespoons of juice.  We can then express this information in an equation: 4T = 4/4T = 1.We can quickly calculate that 4/4T is 1, so T = 1. We then need to determine how many tablespoons are in 1 cup. This is expressed mathematically. Using the information provided and some basic arithmetic, we can determine that 1 cup contains the following number of tablespoons: 2C/T.Solving this equation for C, we get 16, since 2(16)/1T = 4. C = 4. This concludes that C = 4, as key limes are used to yield 4 cups of juice for Audrey's pie.\nSo the final answers is C = 4\n\nInput:Which of these does the word 'concrete' best describe?

It's obvious that Marcia is 2 times as old as Jan, which is 12 + 6 = 18 and Greg is 2 years older than that. 12 + 14 = 26, and we know that Cindy is either 7 or 8 so that makes Greg 14 years old!\nSo the question is not \"Who is the oldest?\" It's a simple \"how old is Greg?\"\nSo the final answer to this question is 14", "answer": " 16"}

Choices:  (a) Office Depot (b) Staples (c) Walmart (d) Costco (e) Amazon\nOutput:1. The question gives us that we would need to go to an office supplies store to refill an ink cartridge, and our first thought would probably be Office Depot or Staples. \n2. Let's analyze each choice:\n     a. OfficeDepot and Staples both sell printers ink. However, in an office supplies store like Office Depot or Stapples, there isn't typically a store-within-a-store section that sells office supplies. Furthermore, office supply stores rarely sell printers, so you wouldn't go to an office supply store for printer ink anyways. \n     b. There are other companies that sell ink, such as Walmart and Amazon. However, Walmart doesn't seem to be an option given that 'a student would go to Office Depot or Stapes'. \n     c. Costco also might be an option if there were an in-store business that provided ink or print services.\n     d. Amazon isn't an option given the other info given. There is no other company that better suits this answer than these four.\n   e. Amazon is an option that some of the users are voting for, however, it is not mentioned in the options nor is it a logical option given the data on hand. Even if it was mentioned in the options, most students will still go through the remaining options to find the answer. This is the most logical option that fits the data given, and not even the most logical option.\n\n 3. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: Amazon because it's not only the most logical option that's given, but it matches all other criteria", "answer": " 15"}

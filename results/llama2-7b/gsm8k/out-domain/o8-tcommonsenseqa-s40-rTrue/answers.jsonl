{"text": ": make meat D: catch fish E: grow food\nOutput: 1st stage: 1. The context provides a bit of information about a particular era in history, which suggests that hunter-gatherer societies were prevalent at the time.\n2. The question is about how Neolithic people's (of the hunter-gatherers) solution to their hunger problem.\n3. The answer is determined by the information provided and the specific wording of the question.\n4. From the context, it is understood that the Neolithic period refers to a time before agriculture was developed; therefore, the answers that relate to growing their own food, catching fish or hunting for meat are excluded, as they don't make sense given the context.\n5. Only the options which are related to hunting down something in order to eat are left.\n6. Option A could not be relevant, as the Neolithic era was before farming was developed, so no one could \"thank god\" for food.\n7. Option B \"fish\" refers to hunted food while the question states they didn't have agriculture at the time, so option B should be disqualified from consideration immediately.\n8. \"hunt\" makes sense in terms of what the Neolithic people could have been doing to address their hunger, making option C the right answer.\nSo the final answers are A: hunt and C: make meat.\n\nIn case you face a very weird question, you should not waste time searching for proper grammar usage or meaningfulness.

Choice D offers an additional solution to a potential hunger problem. Staying awake and eating a food would provide the neolthic person with a short-term solution to their hunger problem. Though it may not be as efficient or effective as hunting for food, it could still be a possibility.\nSo the final choices are B, and D.\n\nInput: What would they look forward to doing more of this summer?

The context talks about prehistoric humans, who were hunters and gatherers, and explains that they gave fire to us.\n3. Knowing that prehistoric humans were hunter and gatherers who lived by hunting for food and gathering plants, the answer is likely that they had to \"hunt for food\" to satisfy their hunger.\n4. The answers of B, D, and I, though logically correct, don't satisfy the context of the question, as it mentions \"the fire\" was given to US, not by us.\n5&6. Option A \"Thank God\", B \"Hunt for food\", and C \"Pray\", would be used by modern humans who have a different lifestyle than the prehistoric ones mentioned in the question.\n7&8.

{"text": ": invent the bow and arrow D: create fire E: invent a tool to catch food\nOutput: 1.\"The solution of the question seems to be \"The neolithic person (is) hungry, so what (was) their solution to the problem?\". \n2. To understand the correct answer, we need to think about the possibilities of how neolithic humans can solve their hunger.\n3. Option A \"thank God\" is not possible for the neolithic person to do, since they don't have any gods.\n4. Option B \"hunt for food\" seems to be an option for neolithic people to hunt and gather food.\n5. Option C \"invent the bow and arrow\" was invented during the neolithic period, which was a period of time when neolithic people were already able to hunt and farm. It does not seem like hunt for food might be their only way of solving the problem.\n6. Option D \"create fire\" was the invention of another tool that could help neolithic people survive. As described in point 4, they had the ability to hunt and gathering food, and they did not have to depend only on fire to hunt for food.\n7. Option D \"invent a tool to catch food\" does not include hunting, and thus hunting for food is not the only way to solve the problem.\n8. With that given context, it can be inferred that the correct answer is B:\"hunt for food\". \n9. The question is not \"What invention or tool did the neolithic people invent to catch food?\", because \"hunt for food is not an invention, tool or discovery, but it's the process where neolithic people can catch food.\" \n10. Neolithic people can also use other tools and inventions to catch food, such as bow and arrows, or other hunting tools.\n11. But what they do not do is hunt and gather for food. In this question, it's the answer to the question \"What did the neolith people do?\".\nSo the final question is: \"What did the neolitic people do?\".\nThe answer is B: hunt for it.\n\nInput: He was always looking for an excuse to what?

{"text": ": find out the hunters on the road D: make a house & grow vegetables E: do nothing\nOutput: 1 The question suggests that the neolithic person had been hungry and was seeking a solution to their predicament.\n2. Given that the person was in a \"neolithic\" culture, this represents a stage of human development in which humans lived in small groups or family units and hunted for their food.\n3. Based upon this information, the answer most likely to represent a solution to their predica ments would be option A or C.\n4. Option A 'thank god' seems to be an unlikely solution as they were most likely not a believer and did no pray or thank any god.\n5. Option C'make a house, and grow vegetables\" seems like a most appropriate solution.\n6. Therefore, option C: Make a house, grow vegetables seems like the most likely solution.\nSo the final sentence is C: Make a house and grow vegetables\n\nInput: The cat is out of the bag! What could that possibly mean? Choices: 1: Someone has confessed something. 2: A mystery is solved. 3: A surprise is discovered. 4: Someone has died. 5: An affair has been discovered.

The phrase \"cat is out of the bag\" is often used to denote an event that was previously secret and is now no longer a secret. \n3). Option 2, \"A mystery is solved,\" seems an unlikely candidate as the question does not seem to be seeking a solution to a mystery.\n4). Option 3 \"A surprise is discovered\" would also seems unlikely, as the question does not make reference to any surprises.\n5). Option 4, \"Someone has died\" could be possible, given that the phrase is generally used to convey information about something that was once secret but is now no longer kept a secret.\n6). Option 5 \"An affair has been discovered\" is very likely. It is the most appropriate choice as \"cat is out of bag\" often refers to something that was once secret and is now no kept a secret.\n7). However, the question does not refer to any affairs.", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": ": pray to god D: ask for food E: pray\nOutput: 1) The question requires an evaluation of the possible responses to hunger.\n2) We can quickly determine that option A 'thank god' is not applicable as the neolithic person would not have known what a deity was, let alone the word 'god'.\n3) Options B & D seem to be appropriate, but A is a very short and broad response to hunger where one would be unable to locate the food required.\n4) Options B & D can also be disregarded as prayers to deities was not a universal practice. \n5) Only options C and E are able to provide a complete response.\n6) Option C 'pray to god' has been answered by other students previously and is not supported by the question.\n7) Therefore, 'pray' is the most suitable response for this question as it provides both a solution to the problem, as well as a method of delivery.\nSo the final possible combination is :  D: pray, Pray E: pray\n8) So the final answer is E) pray", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": cook D: eat E: starve\nOutput: 1) This Question Starts by Using The Pronoun 'The' to Refer to a Neolithic Person 'Their' Solution to The Problem: 'Their' solution refers to the neolithic person and their solution to the problem, which implies that it was an individual problem and not a collective one.\n2. The choice of 'thank god' is a possibility, but it does not seem to be what 'their solution' is. \n3. Option C 'cook' implies that the Neolithic person chose to cook their food, which is not a valid solution to the problem of hunger.\n4. Option D 'eat' is a possible solution to the problem of being hungry since it involves eating. \n5. Option E'starve' is not a feasible solution since it is akin to suicide and not a solution to the problem at hand.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be between option B 'hunt for food' and option D 'eat'. Both options imply that the Neoliths person was able to satisfy their hunger, whether through hunting food or eating.\n7. In conclusion, both options B 'hunt for Food' and D 'eat' can be concluded as valid options to the question.\nSo the final answers are B: Hunt For Food and D: Eat\n\nInput: There are many types of sports.

{"text": ": invent something new D: invent new recipes E: invent the wheel\nOutput: 1) Based on the given contextual information, the question addresses a situation where a \"neolithic person\" is described as \"hungry.\"\n2) We need to consider the various choices and the contextual information given to ascertain the solution to the hunger problem that would best fit the given situation.\n3) Let's consider the available choices: \"Thank God\" is a phrase used to express gratitude, it would only be appropriate in a situation where there is a positive outcome, such as avoiding death by crossing a traffic light safely. The context does not provide any information about any positive outcomes from the solution chosen by the Neolithic person.\n4) \"Hunt for food\" can be helpful in a scenario where the person has not been able to find food through other means or it has been depleted. This option may not apply in the scenario of the Neolithic man with no other food solution available at his disposal. Thus, we can rule out option \"A\" as it is not the most likely solution under the given circumstances.\n5) Option \"B\" is a good choice if the person is confident in their hunting skills. However, the given information does not specify what kind of food they are searching for or it's availability, hence ruling out \"B\" as well.\n6) \"Invent something new\" and \"invent new recipes\" are possible solutions, but it does not tell us whether these inventions will result in finding something to eat, or something to eat better. Ruling out \"C\" and \"D\".\n7) The last choice \"Invent the wheel\" is a big jump from the given context and can be ruled out as not being the solution to this particular problem of finding food.\n8) Therefore, given the context and choices available, the solution most likely to fit the scenario is \"E\" which is \"Invent new recipes.\"\nSo the final answer choice is E: invent new recipes\n\nInput: One day, my teacher said you should avoid taking on any responsibility.

Let's break this down: A: thank god: No, this doesn't make sense at all.\n4. Option B: hunt for Food: This could be a valid answer because it's possible that the neolithic person might have considered hunting for food as a solution.\n5. Option C: start killing zobimies: This is a new sentence that has been added to the original question.\n6. Option D: get help: This should not be an option, because it doesn't address the concern of hunger.\n7. Option Es: Get more food: This would be a logical solution to the problem of hunger but isn't really what the question is asking.\n8.

The options provided are the possible solutions Neolithic people could have found for their problem of hunger. \n5. Option A: 'thank god' doesn't seem to be a likely solution as it doesn't seem to address the problem of hunger directly. \n6. Similarly, Option B: hunt for Food doesn't seem like a likely solution either. It doesn't directly address the problem of hungers, it is more likely that neolithic people would start a fire.\n7. Option D: make a fire is a specific solution for solving the problem of hunger, and likely to be what neolithic people actually did. \n8. Option E: make clay pots/dishes could be a solution, but again it's not specifically addressed as to what the hunger problem they were dealing with\n9.

The first option, Option A, sounds like it would be said to thank a higher power for the provision of food. But it makes little sense in the context of the question.\n5. Option E, which is \"dig a hole\" seems like it could be a possible solution to the hunger problem, but it's not a food-related option.\n6. Option B seems to have the word \"food\" related to it.

Option D is described as \"gather fruit\", which can be interpreted as a food-related idea, and therefore is possible solution to a hunger problem faced by a neolithic person.\n8. Option C can be understood to mean the action of planting corn, which would have been useful for the neolithic individual to obtain food in the future.\n9. Thus, the correct answer is D: gather fruit.\nSo the final answers is D: gather fruit\n\nInput: Taking the time to meditate can be good for your health.  What does meditation do for you? Choices:  a: increases brain memory B: reduces stress C: improves focus D: keeps you young E: makes you happy\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the benefits of meditation, particularly focusing on the mental rewards. \n2) The key term \"good for your health\" tells us that the benefits of meditation go beyond the physical well-being.\n3) The options are phrased in such a way that each offers a specific mental benefit of meditation, without necessarily referring to health. The possible option given here are: improved concentration, relaxation, improved brain functioning, positivity, and mental clarity.\n4) Option A: Increases memory: It is not true that meditation increases brain memory. \n5) Option B: Reduces Stress: Meditation does reduce stress, but that's not the only mental", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": ": cook D: get a snack E: get fat\nOutput: 1). First, consider the question, which asks about the neolithic person's solution to hunger problems.\n2. Looking at the options: \"Thank god\" is not really a solution to a problem, but rather it could be a response to the problem or a way to deal with it. 'Hunt' is also not specifically what the neolithic people did, but could refer to hunting and gathering for food.\n3. Option C 'Cook' is a possible solution to the problem of hunger, so it would be our first option to consider.\n4. However, the context provided in the question indicates that \"their solution\" should be found. 'Their solution' implies that we are looking for something that they did, and not something that we would do.\n5. Option C 'Cook', therefore, is not correct.\n6. Option D 'Get a snack' would be a good choice, if it were written as 'Get a snack to relieve their hunger'. However, the context is asking about the neolithc people's solution, and not a snack to relivve their hunger.\n7. Option D 'Get fat' would be a plausible solution in modern times, but is not likely to have been the neolithc peoples' solution back then as they did not have access to abundant food resources.\n8. Therefore, the correct answer is Option A: 'Thank God'.\nSo the final answer should be A: thank god\n\nInput: What does a stethoscope allow a medical doctor to hear?

{"text": ": pray for food D: gather food E: steal it\nOutput: 1) The first step was to determine the solution that likely occurred based on the evidence provided.\n2) Evidence suggests that the Neolithic person was likely hungry and needed to find a solution to get food.\n3) This indicates that they likely relied on hunting, gathering, or stealing for food.\n4) To further identify the specific solution, it is necessary to understand the meanings and contexts of the given solutions.\n5) Looking at the choices: A) Thank God is unlikely to be an action taken by an individual to receive food, rather it is likely to be a prayer or expression of gratitude, meaning it is less likely to be the solution. B) Hunt for food is a possible solution as it could refer to hunting wild animals or gathering plants for food. C) Pray for food implies that the Neolithics person hoped for food rather than acting to get it themselves. D) Gather food is a potential solution as it speaks to harvesting plants or other food sources. E) Steal it is a viable option as it refers to stealing food from others, which would provide an immediate solution for a hungry person.\n6) Based on the available evidence and context, it is most likely that the Neolithical person resorted to the solution, D) Gather food. The evidence supports that option with the idea that the person relied on hunting, and gathering to provide food. However, after reviewing the remaining possible solutions it was not clear which provided the most viable solution.\n7) Therefore, the most likely solution based on the available evidence is D) Gather food, but more investigation and analysis are needed to provide more specificity about this solution.\n8) After conducting further research, it was found that gathering food was a common approach taken by the Neolithic people. They relied on the use of tools to gather plants, gathering grains, and hunting for food. These actions provided the Neolithic People with a stable, yet often limited, source of food.\n9) Therefore, the answer is c) Gather food. With further investigation, it was found that the solution was likely to be gathering food. Gathering food was a common solution taken by Neolithic people and provided them with a stable source of food.\nSo", "answer": " 90"}
{"text": ": pick a flower D: pray to the god E: gather plants\nOutput: 1) The question provides information that the neolithic person is hungry, and therefore, needs to figure out a solution.\n\n2) To understand the options provided, we need to look at what a neolithic person may have access to and how that might inform their actions.\n\n3) One possible solution that the neolithics might have resorted to is a flower, as they may have been unaware of the need for complex agricultural practices.\n\n4) They may have simply picked a flower, eaten it, and been satisfied.\n\n5) Another solution that the neolitaric may have opted for would be to pray to their gods for food as it was a common practice for them.\n6) Another solution that the Neolithic person might have opted for is to hope for a god to intervene through an act of providence.\n7) The last option would be to hunt for food, which might be possible due to their advanced tools and hunting skills.\n\n8) However, based on the options provided, it seems that gathering food would be the most feasible solution. The neolitaric is likely to gather plants, since it is a simple task, it is easily attainable, and it is a common practice in the primitive society.\n9) Therefore, the answer is most likely to be D: Gather plants.\n\nSo the final answer will be D: Gather Plants", "answer": " 258"}
{"text": ": go home D: cook a meal E: eat raw food\nOutput: 1) \"The Neolithic person was...hungry\" tells us that the Neolithic person had recently suffered from hunger, implying that food was needed.\n2) After examining the choices, we can determine a possible solution for the food problem.\n3) Option A: \"Thank god\" does not describe anything about eating nor solving the problem.\n4) Option B \"Hunt for food\" seems likely to be the answer as it can potentially involve gathering food or finding it for consumption as well.\n5) Option C \"Go home\" does not seem to have anything to do with eating or food as it does not mention food or eating. \n6) Option D \"Cook a meal\" can potentially refer to cooking food or preparing it for eating, and in certain contexts, could be the answer to the problem of hunger.\n7) Lastly, Option E \"Eat raw food\" seems out of place considering the question's focus on food and its use for survival.\n8) In sum, if we were to choose from the given options, we would likely conclude that Option B \"Hunt For Food\" is the best possible answer.\n9) To summarize, our reasoning and chosen answer is: B: Hunt for food\nSo the final answer B: hunt for Food\n\nInput: What does the phrase \"want to eat a live octopus\" mean?

{"text": ": wait for god to send them food D: plant food E: plant a garden\nOutput: 1.) The first step is to infer the context for the question by reading the text and extracting the important points. [1,2,3]\n2. There are many ways to solve an issue like starvation: Prayer, God's assistance, hunting for food, planting a garden, patience, etc.\n3. 'Thank God' refers to prayer, but in modern times, many people do not believe in God, therefore it can be excluded.\n4. 'Hunting for food' doesn't involve growing food and would be impractical as more food would need be available than just for one individual.\n5. 'Wait for God' implies 'wait and see', but nothing can be expected when the individual is starving.\n6. 'Plant a garden' is the only logical option left, and can be inferred by the question.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: Plant a garden.\nSo the final answers is E: Plant a Garden\n\nInput: This is a question that I'm afraid might seem rhetorical to some of you,  Why would you eat a live bug?

Cooking for food - This solution could mean hunting, collecting, or trapping food; then cooking it over an open fire or inside a shelter to improve its taste and make it more nutritious. This solution would depend on whether the Neolithic person had the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to hunt, gather, or trap food.\n3. Eating food - This could be eating raw food or cooked food the Neolithic individual was able to acquire.\n4. Making fire - Making fire would be necessary for boiling, roasting, smoking, or grilling food and in cooking for food described previously.\n5. Thank God - This option does not explicitly refer to a solution for solving a problem related to food.\n6. Eat food and make fire - We can identify that both options refer to the Neolithic people acquiring food. However, the latter option explicitly states that cooking for food is important.\n7. Based on the logical reasoning above, the answer is D : make fire.\nSo the final answers are D : make fire", "answer": " 41"}

They might be using the Bible verses and other passages to support this.\n6) On the other hand, \"praying and Fasting\" (\"D\" shortened) is not a specific solution per se, but rather a general practice or approach that may have been used by some neolithic persons to solve the problem of food scarcity. It could involve fasting or prayer, or a combination of both.\n7) Therefore, the answer to the question would likely be \"thank God\"(\"B\")\nSo the final answer would A: thank god\n\nInput: Which group is likely to most dislike a 6 piece of fruit?

{"text": ": catch a fish D: start a fire E: collect berries\nOutput: 1 The context of the question is asking about a food shortage or hunger in the neolithic era, so the question is asking about how to solve the immediate problem of lack of food. \n2. 'Thank god' seems to be irrelevant to the context, so we can rule that out.\n3. 'Catching a fish' would solve the problem of hunger, but it won't necessarily be the most efficient solution.\n4. 'Starting a fire' would potentially solve the problem in the long term, but can't be considered in terms of immediate relief.\n5. 'Collecting berries' might solve the problem of hungering in the immediate context, but it's not a long-term solution.\n6.

{"text": ": prepare dinner D: build a fire E: use the fire to cook\nOutput: 1 We can start by understanding the context of the question. The given information indicates that a Neolithic person was facing a food scarcity.\n2. Looking at the options, we can deduce the most appropriate answer: D: build a fire to cook. \n3. Given the context, the Neolithic person could have hunted for food, prepared their own meal, or used the fire to cook the food if it was available.\n4. The options - 'thank god' and 'hunt for food' do not seem to be appropriate for this scenario, as it does not make logical sense.\n5. The option 'prepare their own meal' does involve the use of fire to heat or cook food.\n6. However this option does not indicate that the option would necessarily solve the problem of food scarcity in the Neolithic age, as it could have had other alternatives such as eating a raw food diet or finding other alternatives to fire.\n7. Therefore the option that does align with the most logical solution to this problem would be the option 'use the fire to cook the meal'.\n8.

{"text": ": eat more D: work harder E: look down on the situation\nOutput: 1 - The problem is described as one of hunger.\n2 - Option A - says that the people were thankful for what they had; B - refers to the action of hunting for food to feed oneself; C - is simply the act of eating, hence insufficient; D - does not seem to directly address the act of overcoming hunger by eating more; and E, looks down at the whole situation, therefore not a satisfactory choice.\n3 - Of the above options, B seems to fit best - it is a clear direct action of going out into nature and hunting down animals for food.\n4 - This conclusion is further supported by the statement \"hunting\" from the question.\n5 - Therefore, the answer would be B: hunt for it.\nSo the final solution for the problem is : B: hunt for what?\n\nInput: If you have five dollars and you have a friend, where do you feel that you can go? Choices: 1: A: the local pub 2: B: a good restaurant 3: C: a park 4: D: a cafe 5: E: on the subway\nOutput: 1- The question refers to a scenario of having five dollars and the ability to afford things with it, with a context of a friend. \n2 - The scenario refers to being together with a friend, and both options speak of this in the context of social situations.\n3 - The wording of the options implies that the social situation includes the ability to go to a park, which contradicts the question, which suggests that it does not.\n4 - None of the choices refer to the context of the subway or public transport, so this cannot be an adequate answer.\n5 - The question refers to being able to choose and travel with a friend, so a restaurant is not an appropriate choice. Option C is the best fit as it speaks of being able to go to a park with a friend.\n6 - Therefore, the most appropriate thing is to choose C: park.\nSo the final answer for the question is : where do you feel that 5 dollars can take you?", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": ": work on a farm D: gather food E: store food\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the solution adopted by a Neolithic person (of prehistoric people) who were \u2018hungry\u2019. \n2. The options given consist of possible solutions, with descriptions, which could be relevant in solving their problem.\n3. From the context we can conclude that they had some kind of food crisis.\n4. Based on this the solution would have either been something to help them get their next meal or something to prepare a more stable source of food in the long run.\n5. Looking back at the options given we can rule out option B as it does not mention hunting, or other kinds of food collection activity.\n6. Similarly, we can discount Option E, since it simply mentions \u2018gathering food\u2019 which seems vague and could apply to a range of possible solutions.\n7. Option A \u2018thank god\u2019 appears to be an irrational solution as it is based on luck or hoping for some supernatural intervention which would not help solve the problem.\n8. Option C \u2018work on a farm\u2019 seems plausible as it could involve collecting and preparing food.\n9. However, option D \u2018gather food\u2019 seems more specific and logical in describing a solution.\n10. Considering all the options and the context, it is reasonable to assume that the correct answer is D: gather food.\nSo the final option is D: gather food\n\nInput: Your pet ate a toxin that is causing it tremendous pain, what is your first choice at the emergency vet? Choices:  a: kill the doggie b: cure it c: euthanise it d: kill the pain\nOutput: 1). The choice of 'D: kill the pain' is plausible, however, it's not the first choice as the vet will likely take time to assess the situation and provide appropriate pain relief before attempting anything more radical.\n2. So the first choice would be choice (c).\n3. 'Euthanise it' could be an acceptable second choice if it can be proven that there is no chance of recovery or rehabilitation. \n4. 'Kill the doggo' would be the last resort as it would suggest that nothing else has worked and euthanasia has been considered", "answer": " 35"}

Options include: Thank God (no relevancy to the neolithic lifestyle), hunting for food (relates to the invention of tools which occurred during the neolithic period), gathering seeds (directly relates to the invention and use of crops during the neolith), growing plants (direct relation to the invention and subsequent use of crops during this period).\n4. Option E \"becoming prey of another animal\" is in not relevant as this would not be the desired outcome as the neolithic was a time of sustainability.\n5.

{"text": ": eat a bear D: make a cage E: hunt for more\nOutput: 1, The first thing to consider is the fact that the naleolithic person was not hungry at the time of the question, but was rather \"solving\" a \"problem\" that had not yet occurred. (In other words, this is a hypothetical scenario.).\n2. This means that the question focuses on exploring what actions (rather than solutions) the neolithic person would take based on their characteristics (i.e. hunter and gatherer, in this case).\n3. Looking at the choices, hunting for food is not a solution but rather an action (i.e. a way of getting food) that would be consistent with the characteristic used (hunter and gatherer).\n4. Making a cage seems more like a solution than an action, so it is not applicable to the context of this question. \n5. Similarly, eating a bear is an action (i. e. a way of getting more food) that could be consistent with the hunter and gathering characteristic.\n6. However, the question does not ask what would happen after the neolithic people get the food, so it would not be appropriate to answer with eating a bear (since this implies the neolithic has already eaten the bear). \n7. Therefore, since we can eliminate these two options, we are left with three valid choices: B, C and D.\n8. Option B \"hunt for food\" would be consistent with the hunt and gatherer characteristic of the neolithic, but does not necessarily solve the problem, since it just suggests how the neolithic would get food, not what would happen with it afterwards. \n9. Option C \"eat a bear\" also involves hunting for food, so it would be consistent with the character trait used.  This can be seen as a solution to the hypothetical problem: It gives the neolithic a solution for what to do with their food - to eat it. \n10.  Lastly, option D \"make a cage\" can also be considered a solution, since it describes an action that would occur once the food had been found: Making a cage would be a way of storing the food (making a \"house\" or cave out of it).\n11.", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": ": find food D: create something E: pray to god\nOutput: 1: The problem faced by the neolithic person, who was famished/hungry, was an empty stomach and a lack of food.\n2: The neolithics were known for their agricultural practices, which included sowing and reaping of plants, raising animals, etc.\n3: They also invented ways to preserve food and create food sources using their knowledge of biological and natural processes.\n4: Overall, the neolithic people possessed a strong understanding of cultivation, farming, and food production, making them solution-oriented and resourceful in dealing with the issue of hunger.\n5. There is no mention of the neolithic relying on any deity or religion, but that may be the case for individual neolithics during that time.\n6. The answer cannot be A: thank god because it's unrelated to the question.\n7. The answer cannot be B: hunt for FOOD because there is no mention of the person being hungry because they were engaging in hunting.\n8. The answer cannot be C: find food because it doesn't mention the individual in the context.\n9. Based on the available information, it can be deduced that the answer should be E: Pray to god.\nSo the final ans is E: pray to god", "answer": " 295"}

The options given are all reasonable solutions that could have been taken in response to the food shortage faced by the Neolithic people.\n3. Option A 'thank God' is highly unlikely, as this sort of response isn't indicative of the Neolithic era.\n4. Option B 'hunting for food' could be a potential solution, but it doesn' t really explain a fire. \n5. Option C 'use of plastic' does not explain a solution to a food shortage. \n6; Option D 'Ask for help' could be a logical solution to request for fire from another member of the community, but it is not particularly useful in terms of food shortage.\n7. Option A'making a fire' does explain how the Neolithic person would have addressed their food shortage.\n8. Therefore, the answer option of choice is 'A: making a fire'.\nSo the final answer to this math logic question is A: making a fire.\n```", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": ": gather nuts D: pray for food E: plant seeds\nOutput: 1: The neolithc age refers to a time in human history, around 12,000 years ago, when the first sedentary societies emerged.\n2. One of the defining characteristics of the Neolithic age was the practice of agriculture, which involved cultivating and tending to domesticated crops. \n3. Therefore option D is not applicable, as it refers to prayer for food, which was not a practice during the Neolithic era.\n4. Option E is not relevant to the question either, as it refers to the practice of planting seeds, which is a later development and is not mentioned explicitly in the question.\n5. Option C is not correct, as it refers to gathering nuts, which is a small-scale practice and does not reflect the larger context of domesticating and cultivating crops.\n6. Finally, option B is the most logical answer, as it refers to hunting for food, which was a common practice during the Neolthic age, and aligns with the context given.\nSo the final answe is B: hunt for Food\n\nInput: A doctor diagnosed a patient with diabetes.

{"text": ": prepare food D: pray for help E: look for food\nOutput: 1\n2. The solution was, more or less, \"pray for help\", if \"hunting\" required, i.e. \"use force (violence) to get\" the food. \n3. The question specifically states that the person is \"hungry\" and \"neolithic\", i.e. very ancient, so hunting and violence aren't appropriate solutions.\n4. Option A \"thank god\" refers to the person thanking their god, so the person didn't pray by themselves but rather relied or assumed god would help them, which doesn't solve their problem directly.\n5. The other options don't really relate to the question as \"prepare food\" refers to cooking but doesn't address the person's hunger, \"look for food\" again refers to the person looking for food but doesn't relate to their hunger directly\", \"pray for help\" specifically refers to the person praying by themselves, which the question doesn't require.\n6. The most appropriate answer is C: prepare food, which implies cooking and feeding themselves directly.\nSo the final  answer is C: prepare the food", "answer": " 75"}

Therefore, this is not a feasible solution.\n4) Option B: Hunting for food:  This seems to be an appropriate approach in meeting the needs of people who are hungry.\n5) Option C: Eat what's on hand: Eating what's on hand could be considered when there is not enough food and options are limited. In this case, the neolithic person would be unlikely to have enough food at hand on a regular basis.\n6) Option D: Farm: Farming was likely the most common practice during the neolithic era, whereby farmers grew and harvested crops and livestock, which could then be eaten or sold.\n7) Option E: Make fire:  Making fire could be seen as the most suitable option, as this was the only way to cook food during the neolithi period.\n8) Therefore, based on the available options, the most suitable solution to hunger is Option D: Farming.\nSo the final choice is D: Farming\n\nInput: Anxiety is an emotion often triggered by a stressful situation.

The Neolithic is often a term used to encompass the hunter-gathers and food collectors that lived in this region before the beginnings of agriculture. \n5. The question asks us to select the best response to the problem being the \"neolithic\" population, so the options listed must correspond to these factors to be considered as correct and relevant.\n6. Option A: \"Thank God\" seems to refer to religion, which was clearly not a part of the Neolithic's culture and therefore cannot be a reasonable answer.\n7. Option B: \"Hunt for food\" seems to be a possibility but it's unclear whether it was the only response available or if other options were available.\n8. Option C: \"Cook\" refers to the Neolithic period in which the population was not cooking using fire as a result of their hunting and foraging lifestyles.\n9. Option D: \"Eat\" - this is the obvious and simplest response and is supported by evidence of their dietary preferences and eating habits.\n10.

This is not considered a problem because the neolithic period has evolved and the people do not rely on primitive methods like simply praying for food.\n5) Hunting for food should be the primary solution as it solves the food crises.\n6) Options B and D clearly indicate a solution of some form as they involve some action that is being taken, which differentiates it from simply praying for food, which is an ongoing solution that doesn't require a specific action to get started.\n7) From this reasoning, we can rule out option A: Thank God.\n8) Option E : praying, is a method used by people to help solve their hunger woes.\n\n9) The choices left are B and D, which have actionable words and thus make them the best choice.\n10) So, the option B: \"hunting for food\" is the best answer from the given choices\n\nSo the final answer would be B: Hunting for food\n\nInput: The police went home.

Based upon the 5 options given, we can deduce the correct answer. Option A is an answer which doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. We can deduce it isn\u2019t the correct answer.\n\n\n4. Option B which states 'Hunting for food' is another option which cannot be the answer since the neolithic individual didn\u2019t have any means to either buy or hunt for food. Moreover since they had to survive by making use of all the resources available to them, option B seems to be incorrect.\n5. Option C states,  'Buying lunch' is too specific, doesn\u2019t provide any explanation as to what all options were open to them, or when they had enough time to do so.\n6. Option D states  'Making Fire' seems to be a common explanation as to how the neolithic society cooked. It doesn\u2019t seem very relevant to the question being asked.\n7.

Among the options given, it is possible that the Victorian age people would use horses drawn buggies or wagons to take people to the shopping malls as there was no public transport during that time.\n3. The question gives no such information about taking the horse drawn wagon to a park. Therefore, it is most plausible for horse drawn wagons to be used as public transport or to take people to a shopping malls, as during this period public transport was not widely available.\n4. The questions do not provide any additional details about where the horse drawn wagons would take people. However, it is generally assumed that people would take horses for transportation either to the park or to church.\n5. The question asks where horse drawn wagons mostly were taken during the Victorian period. Therefore, it is not necessary for horse drawn wagans to be taken to the park every time.\n6. In addition, horse drawn wagons were an essential mode of transportation during this period, especially in rural areas. Hence, horses", "answer": " 200"}

{"text": ": cook up some D: wait for it to die E: cook\nOutput: 1) The question provides some insight into the situation faced by a neolithic person, and the possible solutions they may have employed.\n2) Taking into account the context, it can be deduced that a neolithic man was in dire need of food, and had to find a way to satisfy his hunger.\n3) The options provided include \"wait for it to die\", which is not a solution and does not involve any activity or endeavor on the part of the neolithic man. Thus, this can be ruled out. 4) Option \"thank god\" is also a non-sensical choice, as it doesn't present any actionable plan to solve the issue at hand.\n5) Options \"hunt for food\", \"cook food\" and \"cook food until it dies\" are all valid options that could have been taken by the neolithic person.\n6) Option c \"cook up some/something\" is a more ambiguous option, as it doesn'\nt clearly specify the actionable plan taken by the neolothic person.\n7) The choice \"cook\" can be viewed as a specific instance of option \"c cook up some/something\", and is more precise and specific in terms of the course of action undertaken by the neolithc person.\n8) Overall, the most appropriate option in this context is \"cook\".\n9) Based on the provided context, the neolithc man had to find some way to satisfy his hungr, and the most logical solution was to cook something.\n10) Therefore, the answer is \"C: cook something\".\nSo the final choice is E: cook", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": ": hunt other animals D: find food E: ask for food\nOutput: 1: Firstly, we can rule out option D: the neolithic person couldnt ask for food since they were not human. They couldnt also find food since they were not yet equipped with sufficient skills to find food on their own.\n2: The options provided leave two options: Option D says that the neolithic hunted for other animals as opposed to hunting other humans and option E says that the neoloidic asked for food.\n3: If the neolithic was to hunt for food, the logical hunting option would have been animals rather than humans.\n4: So Option E makes sense: they didnt hunt for food rather they asked for food i.e, they asked for food to survive and thus option E is the answer.\n5: So the correct answer is option E: Ask for food.\nSo the final Answer is E: Ask for food", "answer": " 20655"}

The given options are: A) thank god, B) hunt for food, C) farm, D) work and E) store goods for later.\n2) A) Thank God: This option is not relevant to the problem as it does not provide any solution to the problem of hunger faced by the neolithic person.\n3) B) Hunt for food: This option implies that the neolithic people hunted for wild animals or gathered food from the wild. This is a valid option, but it does not directly address the problem of hunger.\n4) C) Farm: This option directly addresses the problem of hunger as it involves growing crops. It is an essential solution to the problem and can be considered as the best option.\n5) D) Work: This option can be considered as part of the solution to the problem as it involves working to provide food and goods.\n6) E) Store goods for later: This option can also be considered part of the solution as it involves storing food and goods for future use.\n7) Therefore, the best available option is C: Farm.\nSo the final option is C: Farm\n\nInput: Which type of person would most likely be interested in this event?

{"text": ": trade for food D: steal food E: cultivate food\nOutput: 1: The question is about the neolithic people and their way of meeting a food shortage, as they were supposedly hungry'so what was their solution'.\n2: Option A: 'thank god' is not an applicable solution for a problem of hunger, it's more a thought or reaction.\n3: Option B: 'hunt for food' could be a solution, as hunting could have been a possible way of sourcing food for the neolithic person.\n4: Option C: 'trade for food' could be applicable, if the neolithic population were trading with another for food. However, this doesn't mean that this was an effective solution and they weren't still hungry without solutions such as hunting or cultivation.\n5: Option D:'steal food' is not an applicable option as stealing would not be a sustainable solution to a long-term problem of hunger.\n6: Option E: 'cultivate food' is a plausible solution, as farming and cultivation could also be a reliable source of food within the neolithic community.\n7: Therefore, the most applicable solution to the neolithic problem of hunger would be Option E: cultivate food.\nSo the final solution is E: cultivate food", "answer": " 825"}
{"text": ": fish for food D: look for wild animals E: make a new tool\nOutput: 1 The term \"neolithic\" indicates that we are talking about an ancient civilization that used agriculture and other forms of food production, including hunting.\n2 A \"hungry\" person was likely to look for food which can be found by hunting for wild animals or fish.\n\n3 We can rule out choices A and B as \"thank god\" and \"hunt\" are vague phrases that don't make sense in the context of what a \"neolithic person\" could do to solve their problem of being hungry.\n\n4 Choice D (make a new tool) is also not appropriate as it is unlikely to solve the problem of being hungry, which could have been caused by not being able to find enough food.\n\n5 Therefore, options C and E (fish for food and look for wild animals) are the best choices for solving the problem of being hungr.\n\nSo the final answer will be: C and E.\n\nInput: Where do you see more dogs than people? Choices:  S: grocery store B: pet store C: restaurant D: dog park E: vet office\nOutput: 1 Grocery store is a place where people may buy food for their dogs, however, they are not likely to find many more dogs than people.\n2 Pet store is a place that sells pet supplies and animals, including dogs. There may be more dogs than people there, but not necessarily.\n3 Restaurant may have dogs that are owned by some of the patrons, however, it's not likely that there would be more dogs than people. \n4 Dog park is a designated area where people bring their dogs to play and socialize with others who have dogs. It doesn't necessarily mean that there will be more dogs than people in the park.\n5 Vet office is a clinic that provides veterinary services and care for animals, including dogs. However, the office is not likely to have more dogs than people since it is a business that needs to cater to the needs of its clients. \nIn conclusion, the most appropriate answer in this context is option C (dog park).\n\nInput: Who is more likely to go to college?

{"text": ": hunt for meat D: gather more E: pray\nOutput: 1) First, we need to look at the context of the problem to understand the motivations and intentions of the question. The question mentions that the person was hungry, and this is usually associated with the need for food.\n2) From the context, we can infer that the neolithic person is looking for a solution to the problem of finding food.\n3) Now we need to look at all possible options and infer which one fits the context best.\n4) Firstly, let's look at option A: 'Thanking God' - This option is not related to finding a solution to a problem, so we can easily rule it out.\n5) Option B: 'Hunt for food' is a possible solution to the problem. This is a logical option, as hunting for food is a common strategy for finding food in many circumstances.\n6) Option C: 'Hunt for meat', could also be considered a solution to the problem, since hunting generally involves capturing animals and preparing or cooking meat for consumption.\n7) Option D: 'Gather more'. This option could work if the person was looking for a specific type of food, such as fruits or vegetables, but wouldn't really be relevant to finding food in general.\n8) Option E: 'Pray', could also be considered as an option, but it does not explicitly specify what the person would pray for. Praying alone doesn't necessarily imply finding food, but prayer could be an important aspect of the neolithic diet.\n9) There are two possible answers, option B and option E.\n10) We can choose one of them.\nSo the final approach is B: hunt for.\nThere are two possible answers: B and E.

{"text": ": dig ditches D: build houses E: make fire\nOutput: 1.\u201d The term \u201cneolithic\u201d refers to a specific period in human history that occurred approximately 2000-4000 years ago, around the beginning of agriculture and animal domestication.\n2.  During this period, the main food sources were vegetation and hunting wildlife.\n3. Due to this, the people in this time period have been described as \u201chungry.\u201d\n4.  When asked to provide a solution to this problem, it is unlikely that people in this time period would have a sophisticated or advanced solution like today\u2019s modern population.\n5.  Thus, from the options given, building houses would not be a feasible solution.\n6.  Making fire may be a potential solution used in this time period, but it is not included as an answer choice.\n7.

{"text": ": gather food D: pray to god E: pray for food\nOutput: 1.'The neolithic man' presumably refers to a hunter-gatherer.\n2.  Hunter-gatherers are nomadic and are unable to store food for more than a short period of time.\n3.  Therefore, it is unlikely that the hunter-gatherers had the option of storing food for their future.\n4.  This means that these individuals would not have had the option to \"pray for food\".\n5.  'Hunting for food' is a common activity for hunter-gathering societies, so option B could be correct.\n6.  However, option C, 'gather food', could also be correct, as gathering food may have taken the form of collecting herbs, plants, fruits, and/or other non-animal based products.\n7.  With both gathering and hunting as valid options, neither of these could be definitive answers, and both A and C could be considered as possible options.\n8.  Although option A states that the hunter- gatherers \"prayed to God\", this is not an inherent part of being a hunter-gathers, and is not necessarily a necessary part of their activities.\n9.  Likewise, option E uses unjustified information from the context to describe how hunter-gathers \"prayed for food\".\n10.  Therefore it is not possible for us to determine the correct answer from the information provided, and the answers A and C are likely to both be correct.\n11.  As of now, it is unclear whether options A and B are mutually exclusive or not, however, until more context is given, it is best to treat them as independent options. \n12. Due to the mutually interchangeable nature of option A and B, it is best not to treat them as an exclusive pair.\n13.  Therefore, the two most likely options given are A and B.\n14. The context implies that in reality, the neolithic individual would not have found an option to \"gather food\" but would have instead resorted to option B, 'hunting for food'.\n15. However option A, 'thanking God' is irrelevant to the neolithic man who does not worship God as", "answer": " 21600"}

It's unlikely that the original statement refers to a single solution to the problem.\n4.) The fact that a person is hungry could be answered by various options, depending on the actual solutions to the problem.\n5.) For this question, based on the context, the answer must be E: grow crops.\nSo the final correct answer: E: grow crops", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": ": go barefoot D: go to the store E: give up\nOutput: 1) First we observe that the question refers to a \"neolithic person\" and their hunger.\n2) To answer this question, we look at the options given.\n3) The phrase \"go to the store\" implies that the person in question has access to food through the store.\n4) \"Thank god\" suggests a reliance on a higher power.\n5) \"Give up\" suggests a feeling of defeat or despair in the face of hunger.\n6) \"Hunt for food\" suggests a more active response to hunger, which may involve the acquisition of food through hunting or foraging.\n7) \"Go barefoot\" suggests an impoverished or primitive lifestyle.\n8) So from the given options, option C \"go hunting for food\" appears to be a more appropriate answer as it seems to indicate a tangible and active response to the hunger problem.\n9) Therefore, the answer to the question would be \"Go hunting for food\"\nSo the final answer to the question is Go hunting for food \n\nInput: The world is now 100 million years old, what can we now say is certain about a 100 million year life span?

{"text": ": gather food D: make food E: stew food\nOutput: 1: The question recounts how a neolithic person coped with being hungry. The options provided speak to the different ways that someone might find food, whether through hunting, gathering, making, or stewing food.\n2: Among the options provided, the only one that relates specifically and directly to the neolithic person's problem is option D:'make food'.\n3: The term 'neolithic' refers to a time period characterized by the adoption of agriculture and a sedentary lifestyle. Therefore, a person from this time period might have made their own food either as a way to increase their supply of food or as a means of sustenance during periods of scarcity or hardship.\n4: Making food would involve the preparation of ingredients and the creation of meals through various cooking methods or techniques.\n5: Looking at the options provided: Option A 'thank god' does not directly relate to the neolithics problem or the methods of solving it, making it an invalid option.\nOption B 'hunt for food' relates to the act of finding and securing food, but does not necessarily relate to the making of food or the resolution of the neolithic's hunger.\nOption C 'gather food' could be a method of finding food but in this case, the food would likely be gathered through hunting, fishing, or foraging.\nOption D'make food' directly relates to the resolution of the neolitic's hunger through making and preparing meals.\nOption E'stew food' could be used as a cooking method, but it is not as directly related to the neolithc's hunger as making food.\n6: Based on these factors, the answer is option D: 'Make food'.\nSo the final answer if the answer is D: make food\n\nInput: What is the best quality of a gym teacher?

It was the most widespread cultural transformation in prehistory.\" source\n5) From the context, it is clear that the person is hungry and looking for food.\n6) The options given suggest that the neolithic person is going to solve the problem of hunger by either searching for food (Option A) hunting for food (Option B) or gathering food (Option C) or by inventing fire (Option D).\n7) The word \"invent\" in the sentence means \"to devise or create something that has not been known or used before.\" source\n8) In this case, the neolithic period person is trying to come up with a solution to the problem of hunger, which is related to the creation of fire, thus, the correct option in this case is \"E: build a house\".", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": ": cook D: eat E: pray\nOutput: 1) Given that the question is about the neolithic person, we know that their solution may not be the same as ours at present.\n2. We also know that the neolithic age had hunting, cooking, and eating as key parts of their social and cultural fabric.\n3. Looking at the options given, they involve modern-day activities such as prayer and thankfulness, which may or may not hold relevance for Neolithic people.\n4. The neolithic age was a time when the discovery of agriculture took place and humans began to live settled lifestyles. \n5. Agriculture was characterized by seeding, harvesting, and storing food for times of plenty and scarcity (including hunting during times of scarcity!).\n6. Therefore, the solution most likely provided by Neolithic people would have been to go out and hunt for food, followed by cooking and eating.\n7. Option A: 'eating' makes sense, but this would happen after the act of hunting.\n8. Option B: 'thankfulness' may not be an innate quality present in Neolithic people, but may be an advanced skill acquired through time that they developed during the agricultural age.\n9. Option C: 'praying' seems to be a modern-day activity for people to express their gratitude. It's possible that praying was present amongst some (probably the religious) cultures, but it's not likely that it would be a widespread practice at the Neolithic age and wouldn't be a direct solution to the food scarcity problem.\n10. Option D: 'cooking' is an activity that is part of the life of the neolithic people who were hunters and gatherers, but after this solution was introduced.\n11. Option E: 'hunting' was the key part in addressing the food scarcity problem because the hunting of animals supplemented to the neolithic diet and also helped to improve their social, cultural, and economic circumstances due to the acquisition of resources and the ability to trade.\n12. After considering the above, the logical conclusion would be that option E is the correct answer.\nSo, the final answer is E : HUNTING.", "answer": " 768000"}
{"text": ": make fire D: throw up E: starve\nOutput: 1) The first thing we notice is that the problem to be solved is \"hungry\" - not starvation, not an empty stomach. If this were the case, the choice \"starve\" could be a logical answer. The problem in the question, however, mentions \"hungry\" which is different from \"starved\".\n2) The choice options are presented in a logical order of importance and progression - from starving, through to getting food from the earth.\n3) If we start from the beginning, \"starve\" seems to be an irrational next step. The neolithic man was still able to get food from the earth, which was far preferable to starvation.\n4) From there, \"thank God\" or \"make fire\" might be reasonable.\n5) In contrast, \"thank God\", which is the only choice with a high probability of being correct, actually seems a much more logical answer.\n6) Another thing we notice at this point, is that there are 3 choices which are associated with producing food, while the only \"logical\" choice, \"thank God,\" is not directly related to producing food.\n7) That's why we have to think about it, and it can be one of the reasons why so many people get this wrong. So, we can't rely entirely on the clues to decide the right answer.\n8) Therefore, I personally believe that the answer is C: make fire - as I believe it's more likely to be correct.\nSo the final decision is C: make fire\n\nInput: A good ______ is good for a person's mental health, but poor mental health isn't necessarily bad for a ______'s health.

{"text": ": make fire D: make tools E: go gather\nOutput: 1: The question starts off with a problem- The neolithic people were hungry.\n2. Option 'hunt for food' could be a logical solution to the problem but doesn't specifically address making fire or hunting for food.\n3. Therefore, Option A, which is 'thank God', can be eliminated from the list of choices.\n4. Option B,'make fire' addresses the problem and can be considered as an appropriate solution.\n5. Moving forward to the rest of the list, Option C'make tools' doesn't address the problem, however, neolithic people did make tools to meet their needs, so this option could be considered as a possible choice too.\n6. Option D, 'go gather' is similar to making tools in the sense that neolithic people used such methods to hunt and gather other resources as well, but since this option doesn't solve the immediate issue of hunger, it cannot be considered as a solution and therefore can be eliminated.\n7. Finally, the last option 'Make fire' is the only one that fully eliminates the neolithic people from their problem of hunger.  Therefore, the only correct answer is B: hunt for fire.\nSo the final choice is B: hunt fire.\n\nInput: \"Half of the students at that school won't pass. That is a 50% chance.\",  you understand that as \"It would be impossible to identify every student at that school.\" Choices:  A B C D E F G H\nOutput: 1- the statement \"Half of the school's students won't pass\" means that only 1/2 of them will pass the tests.\n2. It would not be possible to identify every student at school, but passing the tests is.\n3. Option A is 'A 50% chance'. A 50% chance means only half the students will pass because the chance is of getting half or half of the students, not the entire student body. Therefore, option A cannot be the correct answer choice.\n4. Option D is 'Half of the student'. 'Half of the students' is incorrect as one would be referring to the entire student body while 'of the students' is more accurate to talk about only select students at school", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": ": make a fire E: find meat from an animal kill D: start a fire\nOutput: 1) In the Neolithic era, fire was a valuable tool that was used for various purposes and its creation was of great significance.\n2) The word'so' suggests a sequence of events, meaning the person used fire to solve their food problem.\n3) \"start a fire\" and \"find meat from an animal kill\" both imply creation of fire, which was a major advancement in the Neolithic period.\n4) \"making a fire\" implies the use of pre-existing fire to heat rocks and make a fire, which would not constitute a major advancement in technology.\n5) Both the words \"hunt for food\" and \"thank god\" are not suitable choices as they do not reflect the actions taken to solve the food problem.\n6. Therefore, the most suitable choices are \"C: make a fire\" and \"D: start a fire.\"\nSo the final answer can be either choices C or D depending on your logic.\n\nInput: A man sells a used TV to a woman who has just arrived in the city.

During the Neolithic period, people made various changes such as developing new technology and creating different forms of art.\n2. The Neolithic was followed by other periods such as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic and Bronze Age.\n3. While the Neolithic age was not without its challenges, it represented a significant period of human history where people made significant advances in technology, agriculture, and art.\n4. The question asks us to consider a problem faced by a person in the Neolithi Age, which could refer to numerous issues of this period, such as food scarcity, disease, war, etc.\n5. The options provided for this question offer different solutions to the problem of food scarcity, which was a common concern during the Neolithic era.\n6. \"Thank god\", would not be an appropriate solution for food scarcity in the Neolithie Age.\n7. \"Hunt for food\", could have been used as a solution for food scarcity during the neolithic age.\n8. \"Use a stone\", appears to be too vague, as the option does not provide enough information on how the person could use the stone to solve a problem.\n9. \"Gather eggs\", is a strange choice, since the neolithic period did not cover the existence of chickens, which lay eggs.\n10. \"Growing food\", appears to be a logical choice. For many communities during the neolithi age of mankind, farming constituted their primary means of sustenance.\n11. Based on the context and the given options, the answer to the question appears to be E: Growing food.\nSo the final correct answer is E: growing food", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": ": fishing D: grow food E: build a home\nOutput: 1 - We are told that the neolithic person is hungry and has to find a way to satisfy their hunger.\n2 - The first choice 'thank god' is not a logical solution to the problem of hunger. Neolithic people likely did not have advanced religious beliefs or the concept of faith, so 'thank god' does not make sense as a solution to the problem of being hungry.\n3 - Choice 'hunt for food' could be a solution to the problem to some extent, as it requires finding food to satisfy the hunger. However, 'hunt for food', for a neolithic person or any person, does not necessarily guarantee the satisfaction of their hunger as they may not find food and their hunger could persist.\n4- Choice 'fish for food' could also be a solution to the hunger problem in some aspects. However, 'fishing' could potentially not satisfy the hunger, as the fish could be small, difficult to catch or unavailable. \nSo, 'fish for food', combined with choice 'grow food' (mentioned next) would be a better solution.\n5- Choice 'grow food' is likely to be the main solution in a situation of hunger. Growing food allows a person to satisfy their hunger, and neolithic people likely grew food as a means of survival.\n6- Choice 'build a home' could potentially lead to the satisfaction of hunger, but it would be a fairly distant possibility. 'Building a home' may not be an immediate strategy for satisfying hunger and could be considered a longer-term solution.\n7. Therefore the answer is a combination of 'grow food' and 'fish for food'.\nSo the final answer for this question is A,B,C,D,E and the answer is combinations of (D,E) or A,B,C,(D,E).", "answer": " 36"}

The context provides information that the Neolithic people did not have ready access to food, that they were hungry, and that they were looking for a solution to the problem.\n2. The question is asking what the Neolithic person's solution to the problem was.\n3. Given these points, it is unlikely that option A: thank god refers to the Neolithic era, when religion was not yet well-developed. \n4. Likewise, option B: hunt for the food may not have been a solution for the Neolithic period, when hunting was primarily done by skilled, specialized groups.\n5. Option C: harvest food would make sense, as the Neolithic Era was known for large-scale agricultural and farming activities that produced surplus food.\n6. Option D: eat dinner could be an acceptable option since it refers to meals on a timely basis.\n7. There may still be more solutions for the Neolithics, aside from eating their dinner and harvesting food. Other solutions could involve hunting, gathering, or storing food for later use.\n8. Therefore, from these choices, the answer to the question is more likely to be E: find dinner.\n9. This is because hunting, gathering, and storing food for later use, rather than having food on a daily basis, make more sense given the context of their limited food supply and the fact that they were looking for solutions.\nSo the final answers is E: find dinner\n\nInput: Where would you expect to find an alligator?

The question does not make it clear from the given context, whether the option  A) thank god refers to thanking for food or thanking for survival. Hence the correct answer cannot be A: thank god. Hence the option B) Hunt for Food is the option that makes most sense for the people to survive. Hence the answer would be either B: Hunt for Food or A: thank god. But the question doesn't allow us to choose more than one answer, hence the final answer based on the given information is either B: Hunt For Food or A: thank God.\n\nInput: The author of 'Hamlet', is he or she A: female B: male Choices:  A) Shakspeare is female  B) Shakspeare i male C) Marlowe was a male D) Marlowe was female E) both Shakspeare and marlowe were women\nOutput: 1.)

{"text": ": gather wood D: cook a meal E: take a nap\nOutput: 1) After reading the question, we must analyze the term \"neolithic\" and the context it is used in to determine which option is the correct one. The term \"neolithric\" refers to the Stone Age period of early human history, a time before the invention of agriculture and the domestication of animals.\n2) The options provided do not include any details about the specifics of the time period (e.g. tools, clothing, shelter, etc.), which makes it more difficult to determine the answer.\n3) However, it is possible to infer that due to the nature of the time period and the context of the story, the answer must be \"D: Cook a Meal\".\nFor cooking food is one of the simplest methods of preserving food, ensuring its consumption throughout the year.\n4) The option \"B: Hunt for food\" is unlikely for the \"Stone Age\" individuals who lacked agriculture.\n 5) Option \"A: Thank God\" doesn't make much sense for people who believed in gods at a time when superstition was more prevalent.\n  6) Option E: \"Take a Nap\" not applicable as it does not indicate the cause of hunger.\n7) Finally, based on our analysis, we can conclude that the correct answer is \"D: Cook a meal\".\nSo the final Answer is : A: cook a meal", "answer": " 49200"}

{"text": ": pray D: pray to god E: make new fire\nOutput: 1.\u201dThe neolithic period\u201d refers to the early stone age. \n2. This time period is characterized by the use of tools and weapons made from rock, and these tools could have been used to hunt for food.\n3. Praying and praying to God would be unusual for a neolithic person because they did not commonly worship God or hold religious beliefs.\n4. Making fire would have been a crucial skill during this time because it provided a means of cooking food, warm clothing, and light. \n5. The question does not provide any information about what type of food they were hungry for, so we cannot deduce from this that they would hunt for food. The question instead refers to \u201cproblem,\u201d suggesting that the problem they were facing was a lack of food. \n6. Hunting for food would certainly be a solution to this problem, but not one that would have been readily available or used by neolithic people. \n7. Therefore the options mentioned were the most likely solution to the food inadequacy of a neolithic people were praying to God or making fire.\n8. Since this is not a feasible solution for a person from the neolithic era and the only remaining options are thank god and praying to god, the correct option is A: thank god.\nSo the final option is B: thank god\n\n### Additional Information:\nInput: We will only accept the answers that are correct.

Food trucks are mobile vendors that sell food and are relatively common in many modern cities. However, food trucks appeared much later in history than the Neolithic era.\n7) Therefore, the most sensible option is C - Grow food.\n8) Since the word \"hunting\" wasn't specifically mentioned in the options, it can't be eliminated either. And though some may consider food trucks as a form of food sourcing, they are not relevant during the neolithic period. There are other options that are also relevant at the time.\n9) Therefore, the answer is C - Grow Food.\nSo the final sentence is C: Grow food.\n\nInput: Why is Jesse thinking about a bicycle that is not his?

{"text": ": starve to death D: make a fire E: catch a bird\nOutput: 1: From the context, we can infer that the neolithic person is considered to be in a state of \"hunger,\" as they are in need of food.\n2. This situation of \"hunger\" led to the neolithic people attempting to provide a solution to their \"problem\" of being hungry, by trying to find food.\n3. However, the neolithic era refers to a time in human development from around 10,000 BCE to around 2000 BCE.\n4. During this time, it is unlikely that the people of the neolithic were able to hunt for food, as during this time, people began to develop farming techniques to become more self-sustainable.\n5. Therefore from the given options, we can infer that option C should be the correct answer, as the correct answer should refer to a solution for being hungry that the people of the Stone Age era would have been able to employ. \n6. Given the fact that the neolithc person was hungry, they may have chosen to starve to death, but starvation does not address the problem of being hungry.\n7. As such, option C can be ruled out. \n8. Option A refers to a solution for \"hunger\" that would be the solution for the Stone Age era by 2000 BC, so it is not a solution that the Stone Age people were able to implement. \n9. Option B refers to a solution that would have been implemented many millennia later, in the 21st century. Therefore, option B is also ruled out.\n10. Option D provides a way for finding food, without the neolithic being specifically hungry. Therefore, the answer should not refer to a solution that is not for being \"hungry.\"\n11. Therefore option E should be the correct answer because it refers to a solution used for finding food that neolithic people would have been able to implement when they needed food. \nSo the final answeris E: catch a bird   \n\nInput: A computer is an amazing device, it has a computer brain.

This seems unlikely, as they would not have believed in a deity at this point in time. \n4) Option B: Hunt for food, could be a plausible solution, as they would have been equipped with weapons. However, they may not have been skilled enough to effectively hunt the animal they wanted. \n5) Option C: Eat some animals, could be another possible solution, as they would be able to hunt for food. This is more likely given the context of the question. \n6) Option D: Create a fire, could be a viable option, as they could use fire to cook the animals they killed. But the question doesn't specify if they had a fire. \n7) Option E: Kill an animal, could be a viability option, as killing an animal may provide the neolithic person with enough food to survive for some time.\n8) From the above analysis, the most plausible solution would be Option C: Eat Some Animals. This choice is more likely due to the fact that it involves little to no work besides hunting the animal which means the process would be quicker than starting a fire. \nSo the final answer should be C: Eat SomeAnimals\n\nInput: A great person is not who's doing what with what as this is not of importance, but if they what.

If a specific person is said to be thankful, but nothing has been eaten by that person, then it is obvious that the person is not thankful. It is like saying it is dark in a room, but then turning on the lights.\n5) This choice option is the same as the previous option, except in the opposite direction.\n6) This choice can be excluded because it speaks of being thankful, not thanking God.\n7) This choice might be possible, but it leaves many details to be explained. For what food? How long will it take to find food? How far will they need to go? Is there only one person or many?\n8) This choice seems like the most viable option, as it speaks to the neolithic people being hungry, and they also happen to be hunters.\n9) The choice is reasonable, as it is a solution that the neolithic could have taken to the problem, however, it does not match the context.\n10) The answer is B: hunt for witch.\nSo the final answers is B: hunt\n\nInput: The people were very disappointed, because their game wasn't as ______ as they had hoped.

{"text": ": gather food D: fish E: find game\nOutput: 1) The question refers to a group of people during the neolithic age who were faced with the problem of hunger.\n2) It specifically mentions that these people were hungry, suggesting they had little or no access to food.\n3) Based on the context, the solution to the problem of hunger would be crucial to the survival of the people in this age group.\n4) Looking at the options given: Option A is not plausible as there was no concept of religion in the neolithic era, and thus gratitude to God for a food source could not have been offered.\n5) Option B may be a possibility as people during this era would have had to rely on hunting for food.\n6) Option C is also possible as gathering and hunting for food would have been done to obtain resources.\n7) Option D may also be possible as fishing would have been a common method of acquiring food.\n8) Finally, Option E may have been applicable as hunting animals, fishing, and gathering were all necessary activities that individuals in the neolithical age group may have undertaken to procure food.\n9) Thus, based on the above considerations, the most likely solution to the problem faced by the Neolithic person would be the process of gathering food, hunting for food, and fishing.", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": starvation D: go hungry E: eat seeds\nOutput: 1.*: The question asks about the response of the neolithic people when they were hungry. \n2. The options offered provide some indication of the possible strategies adopted in such a situation. \n3. Option A: \"Thank god\" seems unlikely to be in the mindset of hungry people during that period. \n4. Option B: \"hunting for food\" could be a valid strategy but does not provide a definitive response to the problem of hunger. \n5. Option C: \"starvation\" is a drastic measure that is typically associated with hunger and therefore provides a response to the problem. \n6.*: Considering these points, the most suitable solution is option C: starvation. \n\nSo the final answer i C: starvation\n\nInput: The two main types of people that are likely to use a stool with a high seat are what? Choices: A: elderly B: children C: pregnant D: average height E: women\nOutput: 1*: The question asks about two main types of people who are more likely to use a stools with a high seat.\n**2:** The four options given describe different demographic groups or categories of individuals: **(i) children (ii) elderly (iii) pregnant women, and (iv) women.**\n*3*: There is a common theme within these groups that could be the motivating factor for the specific type of stool used: **(i) elderly people are most likely to use a stoll with a high seat because of their physical limitations, ** (ii) pregnant women need to have a stable and comfortable seat to support their growing belly, **and (iii) tall women are more likely to use the high seat stool because of their height.\n*4*: Based on the information provided, the most suitable two types of people that are more likely to use stools with high seats are **(i) the elderly and (ii) pregnent women.**\nSo the final answer for is two: (i) the elderly, and (ii) preganent women.\n\nInput: What do people think of the most when they hear the word 'prayer'?

{"text": ": work harder D: find a new meal E: pray for rain\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\", in this context, seems to refer to ancient humans who lived in an agricultural society, where they relied on the planting and harvesting of food crops.\n2. Based on the context, they likely faced the issue of hunger and lack of food during certain times of the year.\n3. The options provided could be ways in which these early humans solved their food scarcity problem.\n4. Option A \"thank god\" does not make any sense in this context as early humans would not have concept of a god or religion.\n5. Likewise, option B \"hunt for food\" could be applied, as early humans might have engaged in hunting, however, it could be less applicable as a solution during the time of food scarcity due to lack of time and resources (which is the context of the question).\n6. Option C \"work harder\" is a plausible solution. Early humans might have tried to work harder and produce more food through planting or farming techniques, or through hunting for certain foods.\n7. Option D \"find a new meal\" could be applicable if early humans had explored other food sources, such as fishing or gathering wild plants and fruits.\n8. Option E \"pray for rain\" could be applicable if the issue was related to lack of rain or unfavorable weather conditions.\n9. From these options, it seems most suitable to conclude that the answer is D: find a new meet - as hunting or gathering of food could be used as a short-term solution to a lack of food. However, it's possible that in some situations, hunting was not a viable solution, as there were no animals to be hunted. In such cases, early humans might have had to find a new meal through other means, such as gathering food from the ground or gathering wild plants.\nSo the final option is D: find a meal.\n\n#### [9.

{"text": ": ask other people E: ask plants\nOutput: 1) The question states that the neolithic person is hungry. This person is hungry, so we can infer that they're in need of food.\n2) They cannot hunt for food or ask plants for food, because plants don't give food easily, and animals are too dangerous to hunt.\n3) They do not ask for help from other animals, because they are dangerous and cannot be trusted.\n4) Asking other people for food is an option, but that person might not have what the neolithic man is looking for.\n5) The final option is to \"ask god to send him food\". \n6) This final answer is the only option that is not tied to the context in any way possible. A neolithic person, 25,000 years ago cannot ask a god or a god from any religion (either before, during, or after their lifetime) for help because there was no religion.  So we can conclude, that the most appropriate option is \u201cB\u201d: ask other people for food.\nSo the final anwer is B: ask other people for the food\n\nInput: What is another name for the concept known  as \"the Golden Rule\"?

{"text": ": wait for someone to help D: gather some food E: find their own food\nOutput: 1.` The question provides information about the Neolithic person and the context of the problem being addressed.\n2. Option 'Find their own food' would be difficult for the Neolithic man to do given the information provided in the context.\n3. Option 'Hunting for food' would be difficult if the person was unable to hunt because they may be ill-prepared for the environment, food supplies may be scarce, and other people may be dependent on their harvest.\n4. Option 'Thank God' may not be appropriate given the context because we presume the person is hungry and does not have God to thank.\n5. The remaining options seem appropriate which makes them worthier choices, but we cannot pick the best appropriate choice, so the answer cannot be certain.\n6. The best option from the available choices is 'Gather some food'.\nSo the final answer for the question is D: gather some food.\n\nInput: Mom is so _____, she likes to be helpful to her youngest son.  This makes her the nicest what?  Mom's youngest son is 17.  She is 35.  She has three children.  A: sister B: husband C: mom D: daughter E: wife\nOutput: 1`The question provides information about the mother who is described as helpful to her youngest child.\n2. The context shows that the eldest child (17 years old) is the youngest son, as well as that there are 3 other children who are not specifically mentioned, which makes the total number of children five, not three.\n3. The key features of the mother are: helpful to her child, the nicest, related to her child.\n4. From this we can infer that the mother is actually the youngest child herself, as the nicest child, based on the question. Her youngest son can also be her husband or her father.\n5. Based on this information, the most likely option is 'D: daughter'.\n6. Even though she is helpful to her youngest boy, the son who is 17 can also be her husband, as the context does not specify.\n7.

The question is asking about actions taken by the neolithic person who was \"hungry\". \n2) Look at the options:\n\nOption A cannot be the answer as there is no mention of God in the question.\n\nOption B cannot be the answer because there is no mention of hunting or hunting for food.\n\nOption D cannot be the answer since there is no mention of leaves in the question.\nE is correct as it is the only realistic scenario in which a person in a hunter-gatherer society could survive. They would not have had access to grass or leaves and their only option would be to hunt for meat.\n\nSo the final answer will be E: eat meat\n\nInput: Someone with a large personable disposition can be regarded as what? Choices: A: having a tough character B: having a gentle disposition C: a mild manner D: a kind nature  E: having a soft heart\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking us to identify the most suitable description among the given options for someone who is both \"personable and a large\" person.\n2.) If we consider the definitions of the words in the question, we can understand that personality and disposition are qualities that characterize a person and are often associated with personable people.\n3.) So, it's not \"tough character\" or \"gentle disposition\" which are the opposite of personable personality.\n4.) Another option \"A kind nature\" which sounds contradictory according to its meaning.\n5.) It can be hard to understand what a \"mild manner\" means since it's an oxymoron, but it's possible that the phrase means \"showing little or no emotion\" which is also not the best fit for someone who is personable.\n6.) This leaves us with only one option \"a soft heart\", because it fits the description given and also captures the essence of having a large personality and not being \"tough character\"\n7.) By considering all the options mentioned above, the answer will be \"Option C: a gentle disposition.\"\nSo the final answer can be A: having a gentle disposition\n\nInput: I was sad to see my favourite ice cream chain close its doors.", "answer": " 77"}
{"text": ": give up and die D: start cooking E: eat it raw\nOutput: 1, The question refers to the neolithic person and not the present one, which means the question's tone is more factual and historical at the same time.\n2. The Neolithic person was indeed hungry, so, they were likely to start looking for food.\n3. The other 3 options, namely A(thank god), B(hunt for food), C(give up and die), D(cook), and E(eat it raw) are options that may have occurred when they finally got the food they wanted.\n4. The reason the Neolithic person hunts for food is because meat made of animal flesh was considered food whereas plants were considered food likewise cooked ones.\n5. Option E (eat it raw) is the most likely choice, given the context of the question.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question is E: eat it raw.\nSo the final answers is E: eat it Raw", "answer": " 34"}
{"text": ": go to the store D: starve to death\nOutput: 1.. The question is about a particular time period in history, characterized by the use of stone tools and simpler forms of agriculture.\n2. During this time, a key necessity for survival was the provision of food, which often involved hunting and gathering.\n3. The options provided (A-D) can be broken down as follows: \n- Option A: \"thanks god\" is unlikely to have been a solution to the problem of hunger.\n- Option B: \"Hunt for food\" refers to hunting for food, a solution that could have been implemented during the Neolithic Period if food was in short supply.\n- Option C: \"Go to the store\" suggests a solution that is not relevant to the Neolithic period, or is not related to the problem of hungery.\n- Option D: \"Starve to death\" indicates that hunger was severe enough to lead to death, which could have been a result of limited resources.\n4. Overall, the options provide contextual clues to the solutions that could have been employed during the Neolith. \n5. Therefore, the most logical choice is B: \"hunt for food\".\nSo the final answered is B: hunt for Food\n\nInput: What kind of work does this man do?\nChoices:\nA: he is a doctor.\nB: he is a chef.\nC: he is a lawyer.\nD: he is a writer.\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about a person's profession and provides a general description of the individual - \"a man who doesn't do anything in particular.\"\n\n2) Based on the context, it'd be fair to assume that he works in a field that's not related to a specific specialization or expertise. \n3) From the provided options, it's clear the man doesn't have any specific roles or specializations.\n4) He might have a general understanding of a few things, but that's it. \n5) The options A, B, C and D are all specialized roles or professions that could indicate an area of expertise.\n6) Based on the context of the question, it is logical to assume that none of the provided options are correct.\n7) Therefore, the answer is C.", "answer": " 12834"}
{"text": ": kill a wild animal D: learn foraging skills E: learn to farm\nOutput: 1) The context of the question indicates that the neolithic person is in a position of scarcity - the solution is \"hunting for food\".\n2) Option A is not relevant to the context, \n3) Option B is a step in the solution to 'hunt for food'; however, it is not the complete solution. This option is not the correct answer.\n\n4) Option C is a part of the solution to 'herd a wild animal'. Option D is also not the complete solution, so would not be the correct answer. \n\n5) Neolithic people had no knowledge of foraging or farming at the time; that was only developed much later.

Choices: 1. A: A sculptor B: A painter C: A worker D: A builder E: A carpenter\nOutput: 1.) As the given description is indicative of using a chisel, the main activity would be carving or sculpting a piece. \n2.) A sculptor is one who carves an image with a chisel, so the description of the person works with a chisel would likely match a sculptor.\n3.) An additional point in the favor of the answer would be the term 'toolman' that suggests the person uses the tool.\n4.) Option 1. 'A painter' could also be a valid answer, but a painter uses paints to create images, so the given description would be less likely to match a painter.\n\n5.) Option 2.'A worker' could be another option, but it does not specifically involve sculpting.\n\n6.) Option 3.'A builder' would fit the description, and could be a valid answer.

{"text": ": collect some from the hunter-gatherers D: go fishing E: kill some cows\nOutput: 1: Let's begin with the question and the given options. The neolithic period is a distinct era in human history, in which humans began to develop agriculture and adopt domesticated animals.\n2. The options given, in this question, seem to describe specific ways that the Neolithic person was likely to confront the issue of hunger.\n3. Option A 'thank God' is a religious expression which may have been used in certain communities but not necessarily reflective of the Neolithic people as a whole.\n4. Option B \u2018Hunt for Food\u2019 is a logical activity that can have certain religious implications but this does not necessarily relate to the hungry Neolithic person as stated in the question.\n5. Option C \u2018Collect some from the Hunt and Gatherers\u2019 is related to food and hunting. It is also related to the act of 'gathering', which could indicate that the Neolithician gathered their food and thus eliminating the need to hunt as much.\n6. Option D \u2018Go Fishing\u2019 While it could relate to fishing for food, it is not related to the Neolithic time and can more likely be related to food gathering from the sea or fishing.\n7. Option \u2018E Kill some cows\u2019 The killing of cows would require domesticated cows and is not something typically associated with the Neolithic era.\n8. Therefore, it can be inferred that the most likely answer is C: Collect some from the Hunters and Gatherers.\nSo the final alternative is C: Collect somefrom the Hunters and Gathers.\n\nInput: The best way to keep away from the cold is to put on what?

How likely is the water to still be blue? Choices:  Likely to be A: blue B: greenish C: yellow D: unclear\nOutput: 1 We are given some background information in the question, and asked about the likely color of the water in the lake. \n2. The statement \"the lake water cleared up\" suggests that the water is likely to be blue due to rainfall. \n3. However, rainfall can also lead to the water becoming muddy or cloudy, depending on the type and amount of rain, as well as other factors such as soil type and sediment levels in the lake.\n4. Option A, \"Likely to be blue\", seems to be the best choice since the water has cleared up.\n5. Option C, \"Likely be yellow\", seems rather unlikely given the context and other factors.\n6. Option D, \"Likely unclear\", could also be an appropriate choice if the water is just starting to clear and has not had enough time to become blue.\n7. However, the statement \"clear up\" suggests that the color is already blue, so Option A is the most appropriate choice and therefore the answer is \"Option A: blue\".\nSo the final conclusion will be, A: blue \n\nInput: There", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": ": find food D: invent fire E: make tools\nOutput: 1) This question mentions that a neolithic person \"was hungry,\" and that's precisely the reason that they took action to find food. So, it's safe to say that they were actively seeking food to eat.\n\n2) From this, we deduce that the neolithic person wanted to feed themselves, and in order to do so, they had no choice but to \"invent\" food via means of \"making tools\" or \"inventing fire.\"\n\n3) Therefore, from our deductions, the neolithic man's solution to feeding himself was inventing tools and fire - \n\nSo the final answer should be E: make tools\n\nInput:  The citation in question is A: in my opinion C: in my opinion, it is B: in my opinion, the answer is C.

Option A 'thank god' is not likely a solution that the neolithic persons will opt for.\n4. Option B 'hunting' is logical but does not require cooking, hence can be ruled out. \n5. Option C 'cooking' could potentially involve plant gathering and eating plants, hence could be a possible solution.\n6.Option D \u2018eating berries\u2019 is unlikely as berries usually aren\u2019t cooked and not considered a solution.\n7. Option \u2018gathering plants\u2019 seems like the most likely solution as eating plant food is a common characteristic of the neolithic period, and cooking could also be a way of eating the gathered plants.\n8. Therefore, based on these considerations, the answer is E : gather plants.\nSo the final answers is E: gather plants\n\nInput: The best way to make your children learn how to be more healthy is to encourage them to do what?

{"text": ": make fires D: move E: learn to cook\nOutput: 1 and 2. The Neolithic people were people who lived in the Middle Stones Age.  They did not have any idea about fire and they tried to find ways of surviving without fire. They had no utensils and no way of preparing their food.\n3. Therefore, the answer we can conclude as of now is D: Learn to cook.\nSo the final answers are: D: Learn to Cook and D: learn to cook\n\nInput: Your dog can communicate without words, what is he saying to you? Choices:  * A: He's hungry. * B: Stop throwing the ball or I will bark! * C: I'm so glad you're back. * D: I love you. E: I want to go for a walk.\nOutput: 1) The Context - The question states that \"your dog can communicate without words\", giving us the information that the dog is likely to be communicating with us via non-verbal means.\n2) The Answer - With this in mind, we can infer that since the dog is communicating without words, he is either indicating something negative, or something positive.\n\n3) The options - The options describe 5 possible non-verbal ways our dog may be communicating with us.\n\n4) Option A - \"He's hungry!\" is an example of something negative the dog might tell us.\n\n5) Option B - \"Stop throwing the ball or I'll bark!\" - This is another example of negative communication from the dog.\n\n6) Option C - \"I'm so glad you are back!\" - Something positive the dog may be communicating.\n\n7) Option D - \"I love you!\" - This is another possibility.\n\n8) Option E - \"I want to go for a walking!\" - This is probably what our dog is trying to say to us.\n\nSo the final answer would be 'E'.", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": go to sleep D: eat a meal E: try to get fed\nOutput: 1) First we have to understand the question and the timeframe in which the events took place.\n2) The context suggests that the question is about the neolithic period, which could be understood as a historical period when people began the transition away from hunting and gathering and towards farming and herding.\n3) A possible issue that would have arisen during this transition would be famine, or a lack of food and resources.\n4) Option A, 'thank god', is an unsatisfactory solution to a famine, as it doesn't address the problem of a lack of food.\n5) Option B, 'hunt for food', could potentially address the issue, but this would be a temporary solution that would likely be ineffective in the long term.\n6) Option C, 'go to sleep', would only solve the problem of being hungry now, but would not alleviate the overall issue of famine.\n7) Option D, 'eat a meal', is a possible solution to the famine, however, it may not be a feasible solution due to the time and effort required to prepare food.\n8) The option E, 'try to get fed', is a vague and unclear suggestion, it just states 'to get fed' without specifying how or by whom.\n9) Therefore, the best option is D: eat a mea", "answer": " 148"}
{"text": ": wait till tomorrow D: ask people E: eat grass\nOutput: 1 The question refers to the time of the neolithic era.  This era is marked by the development of hunting and farming societies as well as the development of pottery in several parts of the world.\n2. The context is about the neolithic person who was hungry and trying to find a solution.  From the given options, the option C which means 'wait till tomorrow' suggests that the person wanted to wait until the next day when they will have hunting or farming.  This option is thus the most suitable one.\n3. option A 'thank god' suggests that the person was not in a position to provide for themselves and was reliant on others.  In terms of a solution, this option does not make much sense.\n4. option B 'hunt for food' can be considered as a solution to the problem.  However, this option does not suggest the timeframe within which the person was trying to find a solution, so it is not the most appropriate one. \n5. option D 'ask for help' does not suggest an actual solution to the problem. Additionally, it does not provide any information about the timeframe in which the person is looking. \n6. option E 'eat grass' is an option that is likely to be taken as a joke or sarcastic remark, thus, it does not provide a suitable solution to the problem, nor does it provide any information about the problematic timeframe within which the solution was sought.\nTherefore, option C 'wait till tomorrow', which suggests that the person wanted help from someone else or wait until the next day which could be when they have farming, is the most suitable option, given all the information provided. As such, the answer choice is option C.\nSo the final answers are Choice: C: wait till tomorow\n\nInput: She was in no mood to party, but eventually,  when it got dark, she turned into what?

{"text": ": farm D: gather E: pickle\nOutput: 1) First, we must understand the context of the question. The neolithic people were living in a prehistoric era when they were hungry.\n2) The context of the question hints at a solution for the problem of food scarcity, which is not necessarily a unique issue faced by the people of that time.\n3) The question highlights the ingenuity of the Neolithic people in finding a way to address the problem of food scarcities.\n4) The key terms in the question are \"pickle,\" \"hunt,\" \"farm,\" \"gather,\" and \"thank god.\"\n5) Let's try to understand what each of these terms could have meant at that time, when the Neolithic era was emerging.\n6) We can infer that \"pickle\" could mean \"preserve\" or \"brine\" which could have meant that they used preservation techniques such as fermentation or the use of salt to store foods for consumption later.\n7) The concept of \"hunt\" or \"hunting\" was common among people throughout the world before modern times. The Neolithic era involved the use of tools and technology to capture wild animals which were believed to be a source of good food.\n8) The concept of \"farming\" could have referred to the cultivation of food crops through the use of special plants and animals to achieve the production of food. The Neoliths could have also used livestock such as cattle and sheep for cultivation purposes.\n9) \"Gathering\" refers to the process of gathering wild fruits and vegetables which could have been an important source of food for them. \n10) \"Thank god\" is a common phrase that has been used throughout the ages by people to express gratitude or appreciation.\n11) Therefore, based on the context and understanding of the provided details, the answer is A: Hunting for food.\n12) However, we must always remember that there is no one correct answer in English. There are multiple ways to express ourselves even when using the same words.\n13) This is why we recommend keeping a dictionary handy whenever you use our AI to help with your homework or questions to get the best understanding of the context.\n14) Finally, it's essential to", "answer": " 460"}
{"text": ": pray for food D: wait for more people to grow food E: eat a raw fruit from the tree\nOutput: 1: There are 2 likely scenarios here that the answer can be chosen from, but they both relate to a Neolithic person being hungry and finding a solution.\n2. Scenario 1: A lone Neolithic person is hungry, so their solution in that case would be \"eat a raw fruit from the fruit tree\".\n3. Scenario 2: A small group of Neolithic people is hungry, so they can either \"wait for more people to grow more food\" or \"hunt for food\".\n4. Based on the answer choices,  Scenario 1 relates best to A: thank god and Scenario 2 relates better to option B: hunt for the food.\n5. Therefore the answer is either A or B:\n6. The correct answer is B: hunt for a food because there was a group of people and they could hunt together to feed the whole group.\nSo the final answe is B: hunt\n\nInput: To what does the \"Dude\" in the catchphrase \"Dude, Where\u2019s My Car?\" refer?

{"text": ": pray in church D: do some farming E: go into a grocery store\nOutput: 1). First, we need to determine the context of the sentence, \"The neolithic person (was hungry) so (what was their) solution to the problem? (of being hungry).\"\n2. In this context, the word \"thank\" should be replaced with \"do,\" as in \"Do something about it.\"\n3. This means the sentence actually asks what the neolithic person did to solve the problem of being hungry.\n4. The options offered provide different solutions to solve a problem of being hungry, but they are not all applicable to the neolithic age.\n5. According to historical records, the neolithic people did not have many options for satisfying their hunger.\n6. Hunt for food: This option would not have been suitable for the neolithic era, as it would involve hunting wild animals that would have been difficult to satiate.\n7. Pray in church: This option would not be applicable to the neolthic era as they were a largely illiterate and nomadic people who would not have had access to the church.\n8. Do some farming: This is the most plausible solution for the neolithc era, as they were known to engage in farming practices.\n9. Go to a grocery store: This option would not apply to the neolithc age as they did not have grocery stores.\n10. Therefore, based on historical records and the context of the sentence 'do some farming' would be the most likely solution for the neolthic people in their efforts to find a solution to the problem of being hungrr.\nSo the final answe is D: do some farging\n\nInput: The kids all played so hard  that there was hardly time to ____.

{"text": ": make an axe D: create fire E: build a spear E: hunt for food\nOutput: 1.. First, it's important to understand the context of the question: The neolithics were hungry so they looked for solution to their food problem. This suggests that they would have been looking for practical and efficient ways to procure food for themselves.\n2. The choice for what was their solution doesn't seem to fit the context.\n3. 'Thanks to God' - doesn't fit the logical context.\n4. Making an axe - This may be possible but doesn't take into account the time constraints and the practicality for finding food.\n5. Creating fire - This is an efficient way to cook food which is also time effective, but the choice doesn't fit the time constraint factor. Also, other food sources may exist at that time like hunting and fishing which are both plausible choices.\n6. Building a spear - doesn't fit how it could be done at the time.\n7. Hunt for food - this is a possible option that also meets the time and efficiency factor.\n8. Therefore, we can infer that they hunt for food and this option is likely to be the correct answer. \n9. Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer choice is E: hunt for Food.\nSo the final one is E: Hunting\n\nInput: Someone's lost a 32gb USB. What is likely to show on it, after?

It would also depend on the physical memory of the device, which is described as \"32gb\".\n2. Looking at the options, it's important not to get distracted by wording but to focus primarily on the quantity or quantity.\n3. Comparing the options based on quantity, '100% 16384GB' doesn't fit in the context - It's not necessary to fill up device because of storage capacity.\n4. 'A 64gb thumbdrive'", "answer": " 504"}
{"text": ": gather some fruit D: plant a garden E: get a job\nOutput: 1: The question asks us to identify the solution chosen by the neolithic person to satisfy hunger and is based on the premise that the neolithic period was the first to experience humans settling to create the first agricultural societies.\n2. The question gives us the key piece of information that the neoliths people were hungry and faced the problem of not being able to secure food on a regular basis.\n3. The solution they chose to satisfy their food needs was agriculture, which required them to plant a garden.\n4. So, from the given options, the most appropriate answer is \nE: get a job.\nSo the final  answer D: plant a garden\n\nInput: The key difference between a \"nag\" and a \"tattletale\" is what? Choices:   A: The tattletale is quieter B: The nag is louder C: The tattletail has a more serious motive D: The nag is more polite E: The tattletalie is older\nOutput:  1: The question is about identifying the key difference between a \"tattletail\" and a \"nag\" which is a choice of words, and not fact, which is indicated by the word \"is\" in the question.\n2. The choices provide information about the characteristics of a tattletale vs. a nag. They are:\n  The tattletale \"is quite and doesn't have serious motive.\"\n  The nag is \"loud and selfish.\"\nFrom the choices, choice D, \"The nag is more polite,\" is most incompatible with \"The tattletail is quite\" and \"The nag is loud\" since the characteristics provided in the choices are not consistent with being \"quiet\" and \"loud.\"\n3.

{"text": ": bake bread D: collect plants E: pray to the gods\nOutput: 1: The question tells us that a person from the Neolithic Period was hungry, and we are asked to determine what their solution to the problem was.\n2. The terms 'hunting', 'collecting', 'gathering', and 'baking' all refer to activities that are associated with food, which implies a need for nourishment.\n3. The term 'praying to the gods,' does not imply a specific need for food, suggesting that it was not the best answer option.\n4. Option A: 'thanking god' is not associated with obtaining food, and therefore it is not the correct answer.\n5. Similarly, option B: 'hunting/collecting food' does not necessarily imply sourcing food for the purpose of being nourished.\n6. Therefore, based on these evaluations, the answer option would be C: 'baking bread'. \n7. Because bread making requires collecting/gathering and processing grains into a edible form.\n8. By baking bread, the Neolithic person was able to obtain food that could sustain life, thereby addressing the need for nourishment presented by their hunger.\n\nInput: To be able to focus on a writing project, what should she not do?

{"text": ": collect rocks D: gather acorn nuts E: hunt wild game\nOutput: 1-The first observation is that the neolithic person is defined as \"The person who lived during the Neolithic period, an age in the development of humanity when people were inventing tools and weapons etc. and learning to farm crops and keep animals.\"\n2. This indicates that the neolithc period was a time of advancement and innovation in terms of tools, weapons, and crops/farming activities.\n3. The question states that \"the person was hungry\" and asked to find a suitable solution to this problem.\n4. All of the given options indicate methods by which food could be found, with \"collecting rocks\" being the most unusual and inopportune solution.\n5. The remaining 4 options: hunting, gathering acorn nuts, and hunting wild game all involve finding methods of providing sustenance.\n6. Hunting and gathering involve hunting for or gathering food that can be eaten directly or used as sustenance. This would be a suitable solution to the food problem.\n7. Acorn nuts: gathering and then removing the nuts from an acorn would allow for the resulting food to be eaten. This can be considered a solution, albeit a less direct one.\n8. Wild game hunting: hunting refers to pursuing animals or creatures in order to obtain food for sustenance or other purposes, and wild game is a term for any type of animal hunted wildlife can be used for food sustenance. Wild game hunting can also be considered.\nSo the final solutions are hunting, gathering acronuts and hunting wild game\n\nInput: You need to figure out what the boyfriend wants for Valentine's Day.

We are presented with 5 different options to choose from: A: thank god, B: hunt for \tfood, C: harvest, D: make bread, and E: find a tree.\n3.. Option A: thank god is not a solution to hunger, as it does not provide food that can be eaten, and could never be used as an answer because of this.\n4.. Option B: hunt for a means of food is probably the closest possible solution as the person would be hungry and hunting down a meal that could fill their stomach would be the next most logical solution for meeting an urge for a satisfying meal.\n5.. Option C: harvest sounds like something that would fit, as the person would be able to use what they picked to either cook or eat on the spot. Hunting for a meal could also include the option of finding vegetables or fruits for eating, or they may be used as ingredients in a recipe to make the meal more full of substance. This also leads to Option D: make bread.\n6.. Option E: find a tree sounds like a good answer, as it is a solution that would solve the problem of being hungry, but this would take some time if the food wasn't readily available right away.\n7.. So from these five options, we can tell there are a couple of different solutions which may lead to the answer of choice D: make bread.  This option would probably be selected after hunting for food and if the food was immediately available.\n8.. With these considerations the answer would either be B: hunt for (a meal) or D: make, and one of the choices would probably be selected based on how quickly the person could find food that could easily be \tcombined with other available ingredients for cooking or eating at the moment.\n9.. This conclusion leads us to conclude that the answer is D: make bread.

There can be several choices like D,E,F,G,H etc..\n6) The question does indicate that one possible solution was to start a fire to make the situation more livable. \n7) Looking at the list of options, we can eliminate D \"Go back home\". The neolithic man didn't have that option.\n8) We can also rule out E \"Start a fire\" since it isn't the answer.\n9) Therefore we are left with the two options \"Thank God\" or \"Make the situation more bearable\", but \"Make the situation more livable\" fits the context better.\n10) Going back to the question, it tells us that the people were hungry, so the best solution was to provide food for them. As such, the question leads inexorably to choose the correct option, \"Hunt for food\".\n11) Based on the context and the answer choices provided, the correct answer, as per our reasoning, is Hunt for food.

The option seems to be speculation or personal belief without any rational basis.\n4: Option B, \u2018Hunt for food\u2019, is also not a credible choice as the question does not provide any information that the person lacked the ability to hunt, or that the person was in an environment where hunting was an easy task to engage in.\n5: Option C \u2018Create new tools\u2019 is also not a valid choice, since the question does not mention or imply that the person lacked sufficient means or resources to create tools of their own or that the tools that they had were not suited to their needs. Option D, \u2018Find a cave\u2019, is also not credible, since it does not mention any obstacles or challenges in finding a cave, or that finding a cave would meet the primary need of the person (i.e., obtaining food). This option may be applicable in certain environments, but it does not seem to necessarily apply to the situation described in the question.\n6: Option E\u2019 Make clothing,\u2019, is another option that does not resonate as a valid choice. The question does not mention any challenges or obstacles related to obtaining clothing, and clothing is not explicitly mentioned as being a solution to the person\u2019s primary need (i.e., to satisfy hunger). Clothing may be essential for survival in certain conditions, but it is not necessarily evident from the question.\n7: Taking into consideration the information provided on the neolithic people and the physical and environmental challenges they faced, the most credible option is option D \u2018Find a cave,\u2019.

The prayer itself doesn\u2019t exactly translate to hunger being addressed, but instead to pleading for intervention from a higher power.\n\n5) Option D: Make a sharp weapon: This option is somewhat plausible, but if the neolithic person is already hungry, the thought of focusing on making a sharp weapon would be distracting and not likely to be the solution to hunger.\n\n6) Option E: Learn from past: This option doesn\u2019t make much sense as learning from the past might involve learning about what was available in the past in terms of food or knowledge on how to find food, but it doesn\u2019t explicitly state that the neolithic hunter who is hungry will be able to apply this knowledge in the present to address the hunger problem.\n\n7) Furthermore, as far as we know, neolithic people did not have advanced literacy and learning abilities, so it is unlikely that they could have accessed written information on how to gather food to learn from the past.\n\n8) Therefore, the most likely solution is Option B: Hunt-for-Food.", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": ": invent something D: pray E: use nature's provisions\nOutput: 1) The neolithic man probably invented tools for hunting and farming to ensure food. \n2) These tools enabled him to create fire to make food; and to produce food during the winter.\n3) He also invented the wheel to enable easy transportation of food, and the first boat to ensure that fish and game wasn't wasted by being near water. \n4) The neolithlic man could've prayed to god to make him eat more food, but that is not a solution to his problem.\n5) The neolithcal man could'ent have used something to survive; but that is not a suitable option. \n6) We can therefore exclude options B, D, and F.\n7) Finally, the remaining options are C (invent something) and E (use nature's provisions). \n8) While both options are valid solutions to the problem, we're expected to pick the one most appropriate from the choices given. \n9) We've already established that hunting and inventing new tools are very likely solutions that the neolithic man would employ to solve the problem. \n10) Based on these criteria, the answer would be C (invent something).\nSo the final answer C: invent something.\n\nInput: The worlds longest running television series is what?

The problem encountered was food shortage.\n3. The question asks about the solution to this issue.\n4. Looking for the options:\n5. The option A: thank god sounds not suitable here.\n6. Option B, hunt for food, makes sense as it is mentioned earlier that they were hungry.\n7. Option D, cook food sounds also a good solution, as they were hungry. Eating wild animals is also a solution as they were hungry, just not the best solution.\n8. Out of the given options, A, B and D seem suitable but D is the most suitable in this case.\n9. The question's context indicates that neoliths tried out many techniques, including the ones mentioned in Option B and D to solve the problem of food, but D had the most significant impact on growing more food crops for future.\n10. Therefore, the correct answer is D: food on a large scale.\nSo the final correct answer is D: on a large scale", "answer": " 75"}
{"text": ": invent farming D: bake bread E: plant fruit trees\nOutput: 10. First, the options provided give an idea about the time frame and cultural context of the population.\n14. \"Thank god\" does not seem to be a logical or practical solution to a hunger problem.\n15. \"Hunt for food\" sounds like a potential solution, but it doesn'the give the exact details of the hunt or what type of food was hunted.\n16. \"Inventing farming\" seems like a logical answer considering the advancements in agricultural practices during the neolithic era.\n17. \"Bake bread\" could have been an option but seems a bit too specific. It's not necessarily a necessity for their survival or a common practice during that timeframe.\n18. Finally, \"planting fruit trees\" seems like a logical solution and would have been necessary for survival during this era.\n19. However, it should not be the only option, as other solutions such as hunting or farming could have been employed.\n20. Thus, we are led to the answer as \"plant fruit trees\" which is not the only solution but a necessary one.\nSo the final solution is \"plant fruit trees\"\n\nInput: The government will issue a new currency, what will it be called? Choices:  Likely A: currency B: dollars C: bonds D: currency bills\nOutput: 14. First, the options provide information about the new currency, which will be issued by the government.\n19. The new currency will be used alongside other currencies, such as the dollar and the euro.\n20. Based on the options, the most likely answer is that the new currency will be referred to as \"currency\" or \"dollars\".\n21. In addition, the context of a government issuing a new currency implies that the new currency will most likely be issued as bills to be used within a specific country.\n22. Therefore, the answer, based on the reasoning and the context, is most likely to be \"dollars\" or \"currency\".\nSo the final solution \"currency\"\n\nInput: Where did a car accident happen?

{"text": ": build a fire D: look for food E: eat grass\nOutput: 1) Firstly, we need to establish that the context refers to the Neolithic period.\n2. From the evidence provided, we know that the Neolithic era was marked by human transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary, agricultural way of living.\n3. During this time, it is believed that the primary source of food for humans was wild grains and wild plants.\n4. However, as the climate changed during the Neolithic age, the supply of wild grains and wild plant was reduced.\n5. In order to mitigate this challenge of reduced food supply, humans started to develop forms of agriculture.\n6. Hunting animals, fishing and gathering plants are examples of 'hunting for food'.\n7. Making fire would only be used to cook food once found.\n8. Looking for food could involve hunting, gathering or cultivation depending on the available sources at that time.\n9. Since a significant part of the Neolithic people's diet consisted of wild grains and weeds, 'eat grass'  could be an appropriate choice.\n10. However, this only really pertains to those who lived in areas with rich grasslands.\n11. With all these considerations in mind, it is evident that the answer would be E: eat grass.\nSo the final choice is E: eat grass.", "answer": " 180"}

{"text": ": pray D: gather E: build house\nOutput: 1) The question requires us to understand the context of the neolithic period. During this time period, humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary existence, including the beginnings of agriculture and domestication of animals.\n2. Given the context of the neo-lithic era, the options given represent specific practices or cultural beliefs prevalent at that time. Therefore, the first step would be to identify which of these statements is in line with the neo-lifestyle and which is not.\n3) The most appropriate options based on their context and nature are: B: hunt for or C: gather.\n4. Both options represent activities that were typically undertaken during the neo-living period.\n5. Option 'D' is a prayer, and it is unclear as to whether it is specifically related to the neo-lifestyle.\n6. The same can be said of option 'E' which implies building or construction.\n7. Therefore the answer must be B: hunt for and C: gather.\nSo the final answers are B: hunt for E: gather.\n\nInput: When he finished eating he was satisfied.  What does this tell you about the food?

It is asking about the Neolithic person's solution to hunger, providing a list of possible options.\n2.) It provides information about the Neolithics' lifestyle, which includes the importance of hunting for food. The question then asks about the Neolithians' solution to hunger, which would likely involve a strategy for finding food.\n3.) The given options offer different solutions that may have been used by the Neolithic people, including (A) giving thanks, (B) hunting, (C) fishing, (D) planting crops, and (E) collecting nuts. Based on the context of the question and given options, it is likely that the correct answer is (C): the Neolithic way of life would include the practice of fishing, which would have been necessary for their survival.\n4.) (A): The Neolithic culture would have recognized the importance of giving thanks for having access to food. Therefore, giving thanks may have been an important part of their way of life, but would not necessarily be considered a solution to hunger.\n5.) (B) Hunting as a solution would have been necessary for the Neolithic peoples' survival. However, this may have been done in combination with farming, fishing, and the collection of nuts. \n6.) (D): This answer is ambiguous and does not provide specific information about planting crops as a solution to hunger, as this may have also been done in combination with hunting and the collection of nus. Therefore, this answer is not conclusive.\n7.) (E): The practice of collecting nuts as a solution may have been done in conjunction with hunting and farming or fishing, depending on the specific needs of the Neolithic civilization at the time.\n8.) Overall, the most likely solution to hunger for the Neolithics would have been the practice of fishing (C) used in conjunction with some of the other options, such as hunting and gathering. Combining different strategies would have allowed the Neolithic society to be more efficient and diverse in their search for food.\n9.)

{"text": ": look for some D: wait for a miracle E: pray to god\nOutput: 1 The question is about a Neolithic person who is hungry, and it is asking about their solution to the problem.\n2. The Neolithic people were predominantly a hunter-gatherer society and relied on hunting and fishing to obtain food.\n3. Based upon the solution they would have utilized, the correct choice should be D.\n4. Choice A 'thank god' could be an option, however, it does not directly align with their specific situation, and is more generally related to gratitude.\n5. Choice B 'hunt for food' doesn't make sense as they are hungry, and need a solution.\n6. Choice C 'look for some' describes a hypothetical situation where they would be seeking food, but it's unclear whether this is referring to being hungry or something else.\n7. Choice E 'pray to god' suggests they might have prayed for aid or guidance in finding food, but it' is not explicitly stated and is only an assumption.\n8. So, the correct choice is D: wait for a solution.\nSo the final choice is D: wait\n\nOutput: 1: The question refers to the character's personality and is asking which of the possible choices can best be used to describe them.\n2.

{"text": ": start a fire D: start a family E: build a home\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the solution proposed by the Neolithic people to the problem of hunger. \n2. The four options provided are: A- Thank God, B: Hunt for food, C: build a fire and D, build a home.\n3. The question doesn't ask for the best nor the correct solution but just the solution proposed by the neolithic people to their problem.\n4. Option A: Thank God is a prayer of gratitude to God for providing the food that was needed to survive. It is not a solution but a response to the problem of hungert\n5. Option B: hunt for the food is a solution but is not the most probable solution of the neolithic person. At that time they were just starting to figure it out how they can feed theirself. With this in mind and no prior experience they can only hunt for the food instead of catching something or planting at the first.\n6. Option D: build a home does not solve the problem of hunger as it only provides a shelter for you.\n7. Option e: Build a home was by far the best option provided. By building a home they will have shelter and the warmth of it will provide for most of their needs. They can store food and other goods to be used when needed, in addition they could also start growing foods.\n8.

{"text": ": fish D: hunt for plants E: farm\nOutput: 1.The first task is to determine what kind of people 'neolithic people' refer to.\n2. They have been defined as 'primitive' 'prehistoric' and 'old stone age'.\n3. The question then asks about their hunting practices - as described in part as 'hunting for food'.\n4. Based on the context and the provided characteristics we can infer that these are people who were hunter-gatherers rather than farmers.\n5. This is because 'farming' would have been difficult in a'very primitive stone age' without the use of tools.\n6. While it is possible to grow some crops using stone tools, it is clear that the main methods of 'hunting for plants' would not be through 'farming'.\n7. Thus, we can rule out the option D: hunt for food.\n8. The term 'farm' would imply ownership and control over land (including land for growing crops). In a 'prehistoric' environment, and especially a'stone age prehistoric', these ideas are most likely not relevant.\n9. Looking at the options given then, the answer is most likely to be A: Thank god.\n10. The term 'thank god' implies a sort of relief and ease of situation due to God's grace and blessings.\n11. This makes sense given how starvation is the main problem faced by the hunters.\n12. This option also gives a way to overcome starvation in a 'prehistoric, stone age' environment. \n13. Therefore, the answer can be inferred to be either A: Thank god or D: hunt for animals, depending on how we interpret the option D: hunter for animals.\n14. Based on the current context and available options, the correct answer is B.\nSo the final question: What was the solution of Neolithic people to their problem of hunger? A: Thank God B: hunt for animals\n\nInput: Why is the term \"economics\" considered as a broad subject?

The context of the question provides us information about a person from the Neolithic period who was hungry, implying a need for sustenance to sustain life.\n2.) As the person from the Neolthic period was likely to be unable to hunt for food and were likely to live a primitive and subsistent lifestyle, the options provided could be potential actions to solve this problem.\n3.) Options such as 'thank god' and 'get married' cannot be considered options to solve the problem of finding food.\n4.) The option 'forage for berries' could be an option to solve the need for food, but it is not a guaranteed option.\n5.) The option 'hunt for food' could be a viable option as it references the need for food, however, it is not a solution for a person as primitive as the Neolithic age.\n6.) Therefore, looking at all the provided options, the best fit for a Neolithic person's solution to the problem of finding food is the option 'wait for winter'.\n\nSo the final answer would be D: wait for winter.", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": ": hunt animals D: pray E: pray for help\nOutput: 1) We can infer that the \"neolithic\" person is someone in a prehistoric state of society, living simple lives and in need of solutions to basic problems.\n2) Hunting for food is typically a solution in prehistoric society, \n\n3) It is not uncommon for prehistoric societies to pray for assistance, \n4) Neither thanks, nor animals are mentioned in the passage, \n5) Therefore, we can rule these options out. \n6) Praying is likely the best answer, as it is typical for prehistoric society and provides sufficient food to meet basic needs.\nSo the final answers is E: pray\n\nInput: The man had to decide which path to walk for himself.

If he wanted to come to a solution alone, he could make an effort to figure out which path was best.\n4). Doing nothing would not help him decide which path to take.\n5). Pestering other people might not lead to a good decision.\n\n6). Therefore, the options that are likely to help him make a decision are II, III, and IV.\n\n7).

{"text": ": make it D: go to the supermarket E: kill the cow\nOutput: 1) To begin with, we can conclude from the question itself that the neolithic person has a problem with food, and is specifically hungry.\n2) Next, we can examine the choices given, and analyze their relevance to a hunger problem.\n3) Option A, \"thank god,\" does not directly reflect a hunger problem of any sort, and is therefore irrelevant.\n4) Option B, \"hunt for food,\" does not directly indicate if the person is successful in finding food, nor does it specify what kind of food it would be. Again, it is too vague to be a viable solution to any \"food\" problem, and can most likely be discarded.\n5) The next choice, option C, is not directly relevant for food options, but it still does not necessarily indicate success. Killing the cow would still require that the person find the cow and kill it, which is not included in the options given either. Thus, option C is a bit more ambiguous as well.\n6) Option D, \"go to the supermarket,\" is clearly not suitable as it does not directly respond to the questions asked. Furthermore, going to the supermarket would only be required if that person had a means of transportation, and given the context of the question, that would be unlikely.\n7) Option E, on the other hand, does seem to indicate a success for solving food shortage problems. However, \"kill the cow\" is too literal and would lead to potential confusion as to what is being discussed (is it a cow? What if someone else is doing the killing?). Therefore, option E requires clarification and more context before being deemed a suitable answer.\n8) Looking at all the options and their relevance to the context, the most likely solution for the neolithic man's hunger problem is E: \"kill the cow.\"\nSo the final answer would be E: kill the cow.\n\nInput: If people have a lot of information, is there a time they have too much?

Option A 'thank god' isn't applicable, as the question doesn't mention God. \n3. Option B 'Hunt for food' doesn't seem like a viable option as the time period is much earlier than hunting would have been possible. \n4. Option C 'Gather food' is a possibility, however, it's unclear if the person was hungry at the time they were gathering food, or was it gathered to eat later.\n5. Option E 'go shopping' is obviously not a solution to the problem.\n6. Therefore, the most likely solution is C: Gather food.\nSo the final solution to the problem is C: Gathered food\n\nInput: My friend wants to get fit but has a busy schedule.

It doesn't mention the reason behind the friend seeking to get fit.\n2 Given the friend is interested in getting fit, but the activity suggested (sleep) is apparently a distraction. \n3 Option A'sleep' seems to suggest that the friend isn't inclined towards getting fit, but is more concerned with leisure and recreation. \n4. Options B' and C' describe the activity of sleeping itself, which seems to be a distraction from getting fit. \n5 Option D 'Eat well' seems to be related to getting fit, but doesn't necessarily reflect the context.\n6 Option E is an exercise of choice and does not seem applicable to the question.\n7. Therefore the best option would be B: Sleep. The friend, based on the question, doesn't actively work towards getting fit. Even if the friend attempts to get fit, there is limited scope to exercise the option on short term basis, while sleeping works better for the friend in terms of getting fit as a lifestyle and long term goal.\nSo the final choice would be B: Sleeep\n\nInput: She was a good ______, always smiling at people.

Choices: _______ A: Culinary B: Dishes C: Kitchen D: Cooking E: Cookery\nOutput: 1.'Master at' can be interpreted in the negative sense, in which case, the answer would be A Culinary (to be a good cook does not mean one is a master at it); The answer would also be A Culinary if master is interpreted in the positive sense; Dishes can also be translated to mean meals or food which could also fit into the context; Kitchen and Cooking could also be used to refer to the kitchen itself, in which case, master is understood to refer to an expert who operates the kitchen; Cookery could also be used interchangeably with Culinary; Hence, option A Culinary appears to be the correct answer. 2. Given that master is used in the negative sense, the answer would be C culinary, in which case, Meryl is considered to be an excellent cook, but is not a master at it. 3. 'Meryl is an excellent _______ at cooking' could be rephrased to be 'Meryl is a master at cookery' which gives the option E a chance to be correct.  4. The use of the words at and cuisine do not necessarily imply mastery, as cuisine is used to refer to food and meals. \n\nInput: John was working on a case with Mr. Smith.

{"text": ": cook D: get sick of vegetables E: discover agriculture \nOutput: 1.) The neolithic period refers to a time before the introduction of agriculture, which was a major breakthrough that enabled humans to cultivate and grow crops, leading to their dependency on agriculture.\n2.) The problem of hunger arose due to the lack of agriculture during the Neolithic period.\n3.) The Neolithic person had only the choice to either hunt for food, cook their own meals, or get sick of vegetables.\n4.) Due to the circumstances, the Neolithic person was forced to either resort to hunting for food and cooking themselves, or simply get sick of vegetables and wait for agriculture.\n5.) Agriculture led to the discovery of more crops and the creation of civilizations, leading to an increase in population and wealth.\n6.) Therefore, the correct answer is E: Discover Agriculture.\nSo the final option is the 'E' one: Discover Agriculture\n\nInput: It happened almost by accident. After three months of what? Choices A: working on a project B: studying C: talking D: walking E: thinking\nOutput: 1) The question is about an event or occurrence that happened by accident, which suggests that there was probably someone involved in the process.\n2) There were a few options given for the person or group involved in the event, such as: working on a project, studying, talking, walking, and thinking.\n3) Some of these options are specific to the process or outcome (e.g. working on a project, thinking, and walking), while others can be applied to a variety of scenarios (e.g. studying, talking, and walking).\n4) We can determine the likely outcome of the three-month process by using the options given in the question to rule out any unlikely options, and narrow down to the most likely outcome.\n5) The options that are least likely to occur based on the question: walking and thinking, are unlikely to be the reason the outcome happened as they are both very specific to the process.\n6) The options that are more likely to be the reason the event happened are: walking, talking, and studying, which are more general activities that could apply to a variety of scenarios.\n7) The most likely outcome based on these options is probably studying.\n8) The", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": ": work for the food D: have the problem E: pray for food\nOutput: 1 - The first thing to note about this passage is that it is about the Neolithic era. In other words, it is set in a pre-industrial time period.\n2- Given this context, we can infer that the \"neolithic person was likely to have lived in a rural community, and would not have had easy access to food\" (Wikipedia, Neolithic)\n3- The question then asks us to identify the \"Solution to this problem\" which can only be described as one of \"hunting for food.\"\n4- Therefore, the correct answer is D: \"Hunt for food.\" So, we need to select the option that implies hunting, which is \"D: hunt for food.\"", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": ": bake a cake D: take a walk E: buy dinner\nOutput: 1) The word \"problem\" in the question refers to the solution to the person's hunger, thus the choices are about what the neolithic person did to solve this problem.\n2) We can easily eliminate option B because hunting for food is not an effective solution to the neolithic hunter's hunger. It is a longer and much riskier process than other options, such as buying food, which would be a more immediate and convenient solution.\n3) option C \"bake a cake\" may be a viable solution for a neolithic person, but it is not the most commonly practiced solution. This option may suggest that the word \"problem\" in this context refers to some form of hunger or other problem that must be solved.\n4) option E \"buy dinner\" may be a solution that neolithic people would have used if they had the means or resources to do so. However, using this option suggests that the question may be about the neolithic people's ability to buy or obtain food, as opposed to how they actually solved the problem of being hungry.\n5) In conclusion, based on the available options, the most likely solution is option D \"take a walk\"; it is not inherently linked to buying dinner, and the word \"problem\" does not limit the solution to a particular method.\nSo the final solution is D: take a walk\n\nInput: Where are people on a bicycle likely going to be at their slowest?

{"text": ": gather food D: grow food E: fish\nOutput: 1- The question describes the neolithic person as 'hungry'.\n2. We can infer from this that the neolithic period was a time of great food scarcity which was attributed to the lack of agriculture.\n3. However, option A (thank god) is irrelevant, since the neolithic man did not have a higher power to thank for his food problems.\n4. Option B (hunting for food) refers to hunting animals for survival, which was the only way that the neolithics could have eaten back then.\n5. Option C (gathering food) also refers to hunting animals, however, it was done in a different way in comparison to option B.\n6. Option D (growing food) and option E (fishing) both refer to growing food as the solution to the problem.\n7. This makes option D (growing farming) the logical choice, since that is how the neolithic era could have transitioned to the agricultural era.\n8.

Thus, it does not have a need to go to the restroom because there is no organism inside that would need to eliminate waste.\n3) Mannequins are known for their lifeless appearance, however, they are not completely still. They can be moved around, can be dressed up and changed frequently, and they can even be posed in various positions.\n4) It is impossible to give a mannequin feelings and emotions because they are inanimate objects with", "answer": " 250"}

{"text": ": collect shells D: gather berries E: grow roots\nOutput: 1.'Neolithic' refers to the period before the Industrial Revolution when humans relied heavily on agriculture and hunting for food.\n2. During this era, people did not have the same degree of control over their food sources as we do today and were often forced to collect or hunt for food in difficult conditions.\n3. One solution that people might have pursued during this time is hunting for food, as it would give them greater control over their food sources and increase their chances of success.\n4. Another solution would be to gather berries, as they would be one of the easiest foods to obtain during this time.\n5. Another possibility could be to grow roots, as it would be one of the most sustainable food production methods in difficult conditions.\n6. Overall, based on the context and what we know about the Neolithic period, the answer to the question is likely to be Option D: Gather berries.\n\n\nSo the final answer D: gather berries\n\nInput: The sun is always shining.

The question implies that the neolithic person is starving and is looking for a quick and easy solution to the problem of hunger.\n2- From the provided answers, the options that make the most sense are B) hunt for food and E) barter for food.\n3- Option A) thank god doesn't provide a physical solution, it only prays for the solution to come by itself. \n4- Option C) pray doesn't provide a tangible solution and is considered a passive option because it has no action.\n5- Option D) gather food is a logical option in that scenario, but it wasn't likely practiced by the neolithic people as they had yet to develop agriculture as a means for food production.\n6- Option E) barter forfood is a logical option in the context given, as it implies a deal or exchange between people of goods or services. \n7- Therefore, out of the options given, bartering for food, seems to be the best way for the neolithic man to get food and avoid starvation.\nSo the final option is E: Barter for food\n\nInput: Why? is a question that's frequently asked by people.  What? is a better question than the first one. Choices: A: what B: where C: who D: why E: when\nOutput: 1: Based on the logic, \"why?\" is a better question than \"what,\" which makes logical sense since \"why\" indicates there is more to learn about than just what something is.\n2: Based on the logic given, \"where?\" is neither a better nor worse question than \"who?\" or \"what.\"\n3: \"Who?\" is not explicitly a lesser question than \"when?\" or \"what?\" because it can be used to answer \"who did what?\" or \"who is this?\"\n4: \"When\" is not used to answer simple \"what\" or \"who\" questions, since the word \"when\" indicates that additional information is required.\n5: The only question \"when?\" does not make sense to use in the context of the question is \"when will what happen?\" because \"when\" is more applicable to timelines or events.\n6:", "answer": " 8"}
{"text": ": go to the market D: go to the baker E: start a farm\nOutput: 1,2. The question mentions that people in the neolithic age were hungry, suggesting that food scarcity or difficulty in acquiring food was a common problem. \n3,4. Hunting, going to the market, and going to the baker may have been some of the solutions to this problem, but they do not necessarily address hunger directly.\n5. The answer to the problem could be to start a farm, as this activity is directly related to obtaining or producing food, which is a key characteristic of the neolithic period.\n6. Therefore, from the options provided, the most appropriate solution to the problem would be to start a farm.\nSo the final solution is D: starting a farm", "answer": " 150"}

The options provided are: thanking god, hunting for food, growing food, sharing food, and eating the food.\n3. Option A: \"thanking god\" is clearly not a valid option as it doesn't directly address a lack of food or the solution to such a problem.\n4. Option B: \"hunting for food\" could potentially be a solution to the problem of being hungry, however it may not be feasible in all social and cultural contexts\n5. Option C: \"growing food\" could potentially be the solution to the problem of hunger, however it may not always be feasible for the neolithic person.\n6. Option D: \"sharing food\" is a feasible and commendable strategy that can be applied to the problem of hungar. The context of the question states that the neolithic persons were hungry, thus they were likely to be in need of someone else's food.\n7. Option D: \"eat the food\" is a valid solution to the problem of lack of food, since this option directly addresses the problem.\n8. Based on the reasoning above, the most suitable option is D: eating the food.", "answer": " 75"}

It could be a reference to gathering fruit, which could be used as an alternative means of finding food.\n6) Option E \"forage food\" refers to gathering food from what is grown in nature, such as plants, herbs, and other crops.\n7) Therefore, based on the context and inferences made from the options, the answer is likely D: pick fruit up.\nSo the final option is D: pick fruit up\n\n\n## What makes a good answer?\n\nHere is a rule of thumb for how to answer well\n* Take time to understand the question - read and re-read it carefully. \n* Don't answer the question literally. \n* Don\u2019t ignore the context of the question - think about the situation and what is being asked. \n* Find keywords/phrases in the question that will unlock the answer - these key words/phrases can help you understand what the question is asking.\n* Look over your answer to ensure you've covered all the facts and details required - make sure you\u2019ve included everything mentioned in the question.  \n* Consider how the question links to other parts of the exam.\n* Make sure your choice is clear and appropriate. \n* Don\"t jump from one possibility to an alternative. \n* If your answer is too long or too short, cut or expand the answer to match the criteria.\n* Be specific. \n* Consider how your choice relates to the situation described in the question. \n* Think about alternatives - if you answer with the first option, what is another option? \n* Double check the question against the answer", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": ": go hunting D: gather plants E: look for grass\nOutput: 1) Context - The neolithic period was a time when humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agricultural one.  This transition was associated with increased settlements and the development of agrarian societies.\n\n2. The neolithic people faced the problem of food shortages, so they sought to explore new solutions.\n3. The options given provide a range of choices that the neolithic people may have explored in their search for solutions.\n4. Option A: \"thank god\" could be interpreted as a reference to praying or asking for help, which is not a solution to the problem but a reaction to it.\n5. Options B-D: \"hunt for food\", \"go hunting\", and \"gather plants\" are all possible strategies that the neolithics may have explored to meet their food needs.\n6. Option B-D can all be possible solutions, but \"gather plants\" seems to address more the need for sustenance than other options.\n7. Option B: \"hunt for plants\" could be a solution, but it may not have been the main priority as food scarcity was a more pressing issue.\n8. Option C: \"go hunting\" can be viewed in various ways, which could mean either going hunting for game or gathering plant food.\n9. Option E: \"find grass\" can be a solution to food scarcity, but it's not necessarily a priority for neolithic people, who may have been focused more on finding other sources of food.\n10. Therefore, the best option is to use D: \"gather plants to supplement sustenance.\"\nSo the final answer, which is the most logically appropriate, is D: Gather plants to supplement their sustenance.\nInput: I'm going to a party soon, but there might be what?

Option A: Thank God - This option is not a likely solution as it does not indicate any actions that the neolithic people would have taken to overcome their hunger.\n4. Option B: Hunt for food - This could be a viable option if the neolithic person had the necessary skills and resources to hunt for food, but it is not clear if this was a solution that was commonly used at this time, so it is uncertain if this would count as a solution for the neolithic problem.\n5. Option C: Go grocery shopping - This option is not likely to be a solution due to the lack of grocery stores or other organized food distribution systems; and it also doesn't specify how they would travel to a grocery store to purchase food.\n6. Option D: Pray to the gods - This could be seen as a solution, but not a direct action the neolithic persons took.  It's more of a possible outcome for the problem.\n7. Option D: Prepare gathering nuts and fruits - This is the most direct solution among the given options and can also be interpreted as a form of collecting food.\n8.

The question is clear and straightforward.\n3. The only categories that make sense are soprano, alto and tenor.\n4. Sopranos are the highest female voices, but \"want to join the choir?\" does not make a lot of sense.\n5. Alto is the most similar to tenor, but women generally cannot sing an alto voice.\n6.

However, this is specifically related to hunting and not cooking or sharing in a hunt\n6) Choice C 'cook it' is a valid solution if the neolithic communities had fire making equipment. Otherwise, they would not be able to cook food.\n7) Choice D'share in a hunt' is again, not immediately applicable as a solution to a hunger issue or question. The term'share' could refer to the sharing of resources or responsibilities within a community. However, it lacks specificity and makes it hard to determine the context or meaning of the term.\n8) Choice E'make fire' is the correct answer. The term'make fire' can be understood as creating a way to cook food. This solution would be particularly relevant to a neolithic population, as it involves a specific skill set related to fire-making and food production. It also involves the sharing of resources, knowledge, and responsibilities, which aligns with the overall question. This provides the required context for the term'share in a hust'\nSo the final answer would be E: make fire.\n\nInput: Which one of these words bests describes a bookmark?

The word \"solution\" implies that the neolithic people had a way of coping with being hungry, and this solution would most likely involve solving the food scarcity problem.\n4. The given choices are: thank god, ask god for food, pray for food, pray for rain and hunt for food.\n5. The first three choices are not suitable since they refer to asking for help from the god or praying to god for food, which involves relying on god's will to provide food. The fourth choice of praying for rain is also unnecessary since it is raining during the neolithic period.\n6. The final remaining choice hunt for food is the most viable solution, as it implies that the neolthic person or people were able to find food by themselves.\n7. The solution chosen by the neolithic persons was \"find food for themselves.\"\n8. Therefore, the answer to this question is D: hunt for food.", "answer": " 45"}

Option D \u2018Pray for food\u2019 is a religious expression that is more relevant in modern times and wouldn\u2019t have been relevant to the people of the neolithic age.\n7. Option D \u2018\u2019Pray for God\u2019\u2019 is also a religious expression that would not have been used by the neo-lithic people due to the lack of religious belief at the time.\n8. Option A \u2018Thank god\u2019 is a religious expression but it\u2019s also a common reaction to the expression of gratitude.\n9. Therefore we can eliminate Options B and D. \n10.

The term \"if\" indicates the likelihood of the situation being true.\n2. The question is asking about a hypothetical scenario in which robots replace workers in the United States.\n3. The answer should be given based on this hypothetical premise.\n4. The first possibility is that the unemployment rate would go up. As robots would take over jobs that humans are currently performing, unemployment would increase. However, this option is not possible since robots would also create new jobs.\n5. The second possibility is that the unimployed would become a burden on society. This option is also not accurate as robots work 24/7 without vacation or sick time off.\n6. The third possibility is that the unemmployed might become victims of government benefit cuts. This is also unlikely as robots would provide better wages to humans who are employed by them.\n7. The fourth possibility is that the jobless would fall under the radar and would be completely forgotten by the authorities. Again, this scenario would not occur due to the ever-changing technology and need for humans to be adapted to the new working environment.\n8.

{"text": ": create fire D: harvest E: cook\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about hungry neolithic person. Hunting was one approach for the neolithic people, hence option A is a possibility,but fire was used during the neolithic era for cooking, hence can be excluded as options.\n2: We can exclude option E as neolithic did not have oven to bake food and cooked food with just putting it on the fire, so the option is incorrect.\n3: It is clearly mentioned that the neolithic men used fire to cook and roast food, hence, cooking with fire must have been the answer. \n4: From the four options that are mentioned, the answer must be D: create fire.\n5: So, the final answer is D.", "answer": " 64"}
{"text": ": gather D: create a farm E: plant food\nOutput: 1, The neolithic period was significant because it saw the emergence of agriculture.\n2. Hunting for food was a common practice during this period, as the land did not contain a large number of domesticated animals that could be easily hunted and eaten.\n3. As for gathering, it can also be considered as a way of gathering food. However, it is unlikely to have been the main source of sustenance for the neolithic person, who would most likely be relying on hunting for food.\n4. Creating a farm is also an option, but it contradicts the question, as the neolithic period is seen as a pre-agricultural society, which means they would not have been cultivating their own crops yet.\n5. Planning food is an option that could be considered, as it may have resulted in some increased productivity and access to food. However, this would have been very unusual for the neolithical age as it is a post-agricultural technology. It is more likely that they would have sought to hunt for food instead of attempting to domesticate animals for use as sources of food.\n6. Based on the context and available options, the answer is E- Plant food.\nSo the final solution would be E: Planted food\n\nInput: Where should a cucumber be grown?

{"text": ": buy food D: invent food E: make food\nOutput: 1st, we must identify the problem- The neolithic period, which is a prehistoric era characterized by the development of farming and other forms of settlements around 10000-8000 BC. \n2. Thus, The question can be broken down into 3 parts: \n- The first part states that the neolithic person(s) was (were) hungry.\n- The second part states that the neo-lithic person (s) were aware of this and solved it.\n- The third part states the type of solution to the problem.\n3. Looking at the options, we can say option A,'Thank god' is irrelevant to the question, as it doesn't mention being aware of anything. Option B: Hunt For food is a physical solution to hungry. But the question doesn't state any awareness of the problem, therefore it does not fit into the 2nd part.\n4. Option D: Invent Food, isn't suitable for the statement as it will imply the existence and usage of such food.\n5. Since hungry state can be the cause of creating food, using invention does not seem logical. Thus, Option D: Invent food is out of question. Option E: Make food is a good option, as it solves the problem by bringing food into the scenario, therefore is an ideal answer.\nThus, based on the given options the answer is E: Make Food\n\nInput: When we talk about the moon, what are the different phases?

{"text": ": gather seeds D: grow wheat E: gather wood\nOutput: 1: The context of the question speaks of the neolithic person and their need for food.\n2. Based on the context provided, we can infer that the neolithic people had no means of farming or cultivating crops and only had access to wild plants for food.\n3. Looking at the options given, hungry people would typically try to hunt or gather food as this provides a more immediate solution compared to other options.\n4. Among the options, only gathering seeds is related to hunting, meaning the other options cannot be correct.\n5. Gathering seeds is a method of finding food within plants, but it's not the only option provided.\n6. The other options all speak to food production and don't necessarily relate to simply hunting and gathering.\n7. Therefore the answer to the question is B: hunt for Food.\nSo the final answe\u0433 is B: hunt fo\u0433 Food.\n\nInput: The company was going to have everyone travel all over to meet with their clients and they wanted to reduce travel, but the cost of doing so would have resulted what? Choices: A: increased revenue B: increased cost C: cut travel D: cut back on travel E: more clients\nOutput: 1) In the scenario laid out, the company is considering reducing travel costs but has to calculate the impact it would have on revenue.\n2) Looking at the options, we can infer the impact of reducing travel costs. It may result in increased costs for the company, reduced revenue, or less travel due to more clients present.\n3. Based upon the context, we can eliminate Options A, D, and E, as they do not align with the narrative.\n4) Looking at the remaining options, it is clear that more travel would result in reduced revenue, as it would cost more for the company to travel to clients and would need more clients to justify the increased costs.\n5) Therefore, the most likely outcome would be Option C: reduced revenue.\n\nInput: A farmer in Australia tried to grow rice in one spot, but it was not very successful, what was the problem?

{"text": ": gather berries D: praying E: cooking\nOutput: 1) The question is posed as a question about the \"neolithic person\", who is described as having a \"desperate situation with food.\" \n2. The task is to infer what the neolithic person did to solve their food problem.\n3. Based upon the question's context and description of the neolithic people, it is logical to conclude that they \"hunted\" for food. \n4. Option A \"thank god\" is not a logical course of action given this context.\n5. Option C \"gathered berries\" is not mentioned as their solution.\n6. Option D \"praying\" is not a logical action given the description of the food situation.\n7. Option B \"hunting\" is not mentioned as the neolithic solution, but would be reasonable.\n8. Option E \"cooking\" is mentioned multiple times as part of the food solution.\n9. Therefore from the limited options provided, option B \"hunting for food\" is the most likely logical neolithic solution to their food problem.\nSo the final option to the input is B) hunting for food.\n\nInput: He's an active person and he doesn't have any medical issues.

The question is posed in the context of a person who is described as \"active\" with no medical issues.\n2.) The question asks for the logical next fitness-related activity choice for the individual given the description of their overall health and current activities.\n3.) Option A \"Crossfit\" is not a suitable activity given the lack of restrictions described in the question.\n4.) Option B \"HIIT\" is not a suitable option given the lack of restrictions in the question.\n5.) Option C \"running\" is not a suitable choice as it is likely that the individual would have already been running.\n6.) Option E \"swimming\" is not the most suitable choice because of the presence of \"water\" in the activity description.  If the individual were unable to swim, they would not be able to particip", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": ": make a fishing net D: hunt for a food E: pray\nOutput: 1- First, we can rule out options A and B which imply a higher level of development rather than what is being asked for.\n2- Option C might indicate an innovation in hunting or the development of a tool like a net, however it is not specified, so it can be eliminated.\n3- Option D also falls short of the context of being hunted.\n4- Option E is not relevant to the context of being hunter, which we know due to the description of the neolithic as being hunters.\n5- Option E is the best option to choose, as praying for food is a common occurrence among religions and a commonly known approach to being hungry.\nSo the final option is E: Pray\n\nInput: How might a small bakery get a lot of people to come on a Saturday morning after they were closed all week? Choices: 1. Place lots of signs in the area. 2. Place 2 TV ads on 2 different channels. 3. Go on local TV with a special on why a person should come. 4. Open on weekends. 5. Put a big billboard up on a major road. Output: First, we need to look at the words of the question in order to identify the correct answer choice. The word \"small\" suggests that a bakery is to be considered. Bakery's offer treats to people, so it is in a service industry and operational hours can be a choice.\nSo the option that makes sense is 4, because Bakery businesses typically don't open on weekends as opposed to those who offer services like massage or therapy.\n\nInput: If a tree is growing from a bamboo stalk, then how can you tell that it is from bamboo?

{"text": ": search for food D: gather food E: fish\nOutput: 1.) The question is about a neolithic person who is hungry, and we know from the context that the problem is related to a lack of food.\n2. We can then see that the options given are all different ways of acquiring food.\n3. Option A \"thank God\" - is not a valid solution as it cannot be practically fulfilled by a neolithic hunter.\n4. Option B \"hunt for food\" is an action that a person might take to find food.\n5. Option C'search for food' implies finding food, which could be an effective solution to the hungry person's plight.\n6. Option D \u2018gather food\u2019 could mean finding a source of food or harvesting existing food.\n7. It is likely that this person would have gathered food from sources such as animals, plants, or fish.\n8. Lastly, option E 'fish' could mean using fishing as a method of finding food, which could have been especially useful in the period of history which the question is referring to.\n9. Therefore considering these options, the answer is most likely D: gather food.\nSo the final answe is E: gather food\n\nInput: At what step of making a cheese plate could you use pickled okra flowers?

{"text": ": plant grains D: live with wild cats E: invent tools\nOutput: 1&2. The question is asking about the type of solution employed by the Neolithic person who \"was hungry.\"\n3. The options are: a. \"thank God\", b. \"hunt for food,\" c. \"plant grains,\" d. \"live with wild cats\", and e. \"invent tools.\"\n4. The most likely solution is D, \"live with wild cates. Because they must have done something to feed themselves.\n5. The other options are unlikely to be considered by a Neolithic person because of the following:\n6. \"live with wildcats\" is a solution that is more likely to apply to nomadic, hunter-gatherer individuals. They do not have access to grains or tools, or any reason to plant grains, so that option is ruled out.\n7. \"plant grains\" is an option that is more likely to be used after the Neolithic age, when people began to settle and start farming. At that point, they would likely have started planting grains to feed themselves. Before that, they wouldn't have needed to do this because they could rely on hunting. \n8. \"invent tools\" is an option that requires a certain degree of ingenuity and creativity that may not be available to Neolithic individuals.\n9. Finally, the Neolithic period was characterized by religious and spiritual beliefs based on the worshipping of ancestors. Saying \"thank God\" would be unlikely in that context.\n10. Therefore, the most likely solution is D: \"live with wildcates\".\nSo the final decision is D: live with wildcats\n\nInput: A company that has been around for 45 years, but no longer exists.

{"text": ": go to market and buy some D: work hard for wage E: work for self sufficiency\nOutput: 1) First step we need to do is to understand the question. The question is asking regarding the \"neolithic person\" The option A (work for wage) doesn't make any sense as the time period in that era was from 8000 BC to 5000 BC, which means from that era, we cannot understand whether a person was working for wage or not.\n2) Option B (go to market and buy some) doesn't make much sense also. The time and history in that period is not very clear on whether people are going to market. Also, the option doesn't make any logical sense on what is happening in the person's hunger context.\n3) Option C (work hard for wage) doesn\u2019t make any sense. The time period is about 8000-5000 BC. That time period is in between the stone and bronze age time. It makes no sense that the person is working for wage in between those two periods.\n4) The remaining three (D, E & F) makes sense. So, option F (work for self sufficiency) makes most sense in this case.\nSo the final choice is F: work for self suficiency", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": ": ask meister D: fish for supper E: beg food\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about a specific type of solution a person might have had during the neolithic age.\n2. The options are all describing food-related solutions but lack specificity on what the problem was and who it was directed towards.\n3. The option \"beg food\" suggests a solution focused on securing meals from people directly, which would not have been applicable during the neolithical age when people relied on agriculture. \n4. The option \"ask meister\" could also be used as a solution directed at someone with authority. \n5. The option \"fish for supper\" could imply a general method of procurement for fish, which would not necessarily be directed at a specific person or group in need.\n6. The option \"thank God\" is vague and could refer to a specific problem or not and may not be directed towards a specific person or class of people.\n7. There is no mention of the specifics of the hungry person or their personal circumstances and what solutions they have considered.\n8. The most logical and specific solution that aligns with the context would be \"hunt for food\" with the implication of the general term \"food\" being intended for the hungry person.\n9. The option \"hunt for food \"(C) is the best answer choice.\nSo the final solution is C: Hunt for food\n\nInput: This person did their best to not cause  pain B but sadly did. They have now what? Choices: A: to confess B: forgotten C: forgiven D: regret E: regret again?\nOutput: 1) It is clear from the context that it was the person's intention to not cause pain, but they did.\n2) This indicates that it may be necessary to take action to address the situation and move on.\n3) Based on the context, the options provided are:\na) \"confess\" suggests confessing to the wrongdoing and accepting responsibility for the pain caused.\nb) \"forgiven\" suggests that forgiveness and reconciliation have already taken place.\nc) \"regret\" suggests that the person recognizes and accepts the pain caused without seeking forgiveness.\nd) \"regret again\" indicates an inability to move on as the person", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": ": cook their food D: hunt and cook E: eat it raw\nOutput: 1.) The context given in the problem involves the use of hunter-gatherers, whose main sources of food were primarily gathered from the surrounding environment \n2.)

Therefore, the answer is C (hunt food and cook)\nSo the final answer  is C (hunt and cook)\n\nInput: What are some possible responses to the question \"what does a bird eat?\" Choices:  A\" berries B\" insects C) worms D) fish E) nectar\nOutput: 1) In the question, there is an allusion to being inquisitive about the eating habits of birds. \n2) Since the question posed is quite ambiguous to answer, one can be sure not to get a specific answer about what these birds eat. \n3) The question, though is likely to indicate a desire to understand more about which food these birds prefer to eat. \n4) One can observe that in an attempt to get the answer to the general question posed about bird feeding habits, one can answer in terms of the types of food birds like to eat and this can be answered from the list given - Berries, Insects, Worms, Fish and Nectar.\n5) On the basis of the answer to the question and the choices given, the options that can be eliminated can be D and E (fish and nectar).\n6) Since the question has not indicated the need for any scientific reasoning, one can eliminate the more general scientific explanation (insects) and the one that sounds less logical D (the response to the general question was given at the end of a paragraph rather than the beginning)\n7) The question posed seems to pertain to what kind of food humans should eat. Therefore, though fish and insects may be food items that birds may also prefer to eat, the answer here is more inclined towards human food choices - Berries, Inseccts, Worms or Nectar.\n8) Therefore, the answer is A (Berries)\nSo the final  answer is A (Berry)\n\nInput: Which of the following could you see in a city?

{"text": ": build a fire to cook D: get ready for another winter E: plant seeds\nOutput: 1)The given context suggests that the individual was a \"neolithic\" person, who had to solve a problem related to hunger.\n2) The solutions mentioned for different types of problems in a previous question include \"thanks to god\" and \"planting seeds,\" however, this solution does not seem plausible, as it is unlikely that a prehistoric person would have such religious beliefs or be able to cultivate food.\n3) The remaining options listed are more consistent with the context of the problem, so the correct answer is likely \"C: Build a fire to cook.\"\n4) This is because building a fire is a practical solution to the problem of hunger because it allows the person to cook food, ensuring that they will have enough food to survive. \n5) Additionally, it can also provide the person with warmth and allow them to spend more time doing activities related to their survival and long-term needs, such as making arrows or fishing nets.\nSo the final outcome is: C: Build a fire to Cook.\n\nInput: Where would you expect to find a microphone boom? Choices: 1:A recording studio 2:A television show 3:A movie set 4:Radio show 5:TV studio\nOutput:  Since the question is about where a microphone boom could be found, the answer seems to be a place relevant to audio recording.\n1) A recording studio would be a suitable option because it is a place where music, voiceover, podcasts, interviews and podcasts can be performed and recorded. \n2) A television show would be a suitable option as microphones are often used on stage. \n3) A movie set is an option because microphones are used for sound recording in movies.\n4) Radio show has a boom mic to capture the voices.\n5) TV Studios also have microphone booms, as microphones can be used to record the voices of presenters or actors for broadcast. \n1)The correct answer is option A( recording studio)\n \n### Link to the solution for above exercise: https://leetcode.com/playground/practice-session/?entry=/practice-leetcode-2/", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": pray for food D: pray for rain for better harvesting E: wait for more sun\nOutput: 1: The question states that the neolithic person is hungry, and asks for a solution.\n2. We can infer that they don't have any food as of now because they are hungry, so they may not have any at all.\n3. The term 'hunting' can refer to various activities such as looking for wild game to catch and eat, which does not help in feeding all the people in a group.\n4. We can rule out options A, B, and E as they are vague and not practical.\n5. Option C 'pray for food' is an action that they can take, but it's not a realistic solution to their problem. However, the neolithic people might have prayed for God to send them food or to create a good harvest, but there is no guarantee that prayers will be answered.\n6. Option D 'pray for rain for better harvests' can be a solution, but it could also lead to a worse situation where there is a drought, and no harvest is produced or no water is left to drink and survive.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: pray for food.\nSo the final answers is C: pray for foo", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": ": try agriculture D: create fire E: cook over rocks\nOutput: 1. The question states that the person was hungry, but provides no further information. \n2. Given that there is no mention of any method being tried to solve the implied problem initially, we can deduce the most likely solution based on context clues. \n3. Choices A and D may be in line with the solution, but the context does not say the person was successful with either of them initially.\n4. Choices B, C, and E are all methods which have been used by mankind as early as neolithic times to hunt for food. \n5. These choices are most likely to be the answer as they are the most likely to have been tried by a hungry person.\n6. Choice E mentions 'cooking', which is a solution applicable to all other choices, but it states the solution was 'over rocks' which may imply that some other choice was successful.\n7. Therefore according to the choices: The answer is E since it mentions successful cooking over rocks.\nSo the final solution is E: Cooking over rocks\n\nInput: The book is a work of fiction, not a biography,  But they couldn't find enough evidence to what?

Option A 'thank God' is unlikely to be the reason as the Neolithic people are hunter gatherers and didn't have a god yet.\n3. Option C'make more farming' is logical if you want to grow more food.\n4. Option D 'find a more populated place' is similar in logic but it makes no sense to look to move. \n5. Option E 'look for more fruit trees' is the most feasible option for the Neolithic person. \n6. Fruit trees can provide a reliable source of food to the neolithic people.\n7. Therefore the answer would be E: look for more Fruit trees!\nSo the final answer would be E: find more Fruit trees!", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": ": pray for rain D: seek help E: start a fire\nOutput: 1) The question implies that the neolithic person faced the problem of hunger and needed a solution. Given that the neolithiic period marked the transition from a nomadic lifestyle to a more settled one based on agriculture and animal husbandry, we can infer that the neolithian person (as opposed to a hunter-gatherer) was more likely to live in the same place for a longer period of time.\n2) This information suggests that the neolithc person may have sought to sustain their livelihood.\n3) Thus, the natural response to a consistent food shortage would be to seek farming and other ways to provide a food supply.\n4) Looking at the given options: thank god is not really related to the farming aspect and would more likely be an individual response to hunger, hunt for food suggests looking elsewhere for food, pray for rain would only solve rain-related issues and not food shortage, seek help is similar to pray for rain as it would only alleviate a problem, start a fire sounds interesting but not really related to seeking food either.\n5) Therefore, the only suitable option to solve the problem of hunger is D: Seek help and support.\nSo the final answers is D: Seek Help & Support\n***\n###### **Solution**\n\nInstruction:Answer the following gramma math question.\nWhat can be inferred about Billy from the given information?

The question refers to the prevalence of Americans eating while driving, watching television, sleeping, cooking, or working. While the study may vary depending on the sample size and methodology used, it is unlikely that more than 100% of Americans eat while driving, watching TV, sleeping, cookin, or working.\n2.) The key takeaway is that eating while engaging in other activities is becoming a common problem for many Americans. \n3.) Based on our context, the options can be narrowed down to options that are appropriate in context. options that are inappropriate can be ruled out. \n4.) If we consider option B, A'drivers' are not eating; they are driving. \n5.) Likewise, sleepers are not eating, and cooks and watchers are not eating while working.\n6.)

{"text": ": kill animals D: use a gun E: pray\nOutput: 1) The question presents a scenario in which a person during the Neolithic era experiences hunger and needs a solution.\n2) The given options suggest specific approaches to food procurement:\na) Option A, 'Thank God' indicates that the person could have relied on divine intervention for food. However, 'divinity' is not a specific deity, and its appearance in the options suggests it is meant to be generalized and open to interpretation. This makes Option A an invalid solution as it is not specific to any particular religion or belief system.\nb) Option B, 'Hunt for Food' references procuring food through hunting, which could have been possible at the time of the neolithic era. However, 'hunting' is not an exact or specific term, which indicates that any specific approach or technique to 'hunting for food' would depend on the environment and resources available at the time. This also suggests that Option B could indicate a wide range of methods and strategies for hunting and securing food sources.\nc) Option C, 'Kill animals' suggests a direct approach to securing food sources by slaughtering and acquiring animals as provisions. This is a valid solution, and it could have been a viable and practical strategy for obtaining food during the Neolithian era or any other times in which hunting, trapping and butchering animals was a standard practice.\nd) Option D, 'Use a gun' is a modern approach to food procurement that is not relevant to the Neolithic period and is an invalid solution.\ne) Option E, 'Pray' refers to seeking divine intervention for food, which could have been a viability during the Neolithical era. The question, however, suggests that this is not a viable option as it is not likely that a person during the Neoilithic era would have possessed such advanced technology to operate a gun in terms of mechanics or manufacturing.\n3) To answer the question correctly, it is important to apply reason and logic to the given choices and to avoid making assumptions or taking personal biases into consideration.

{"text": ": pick a plant D: plant seeds E: cook\nOutput: 1 The question is about the neolithic person and their solution to hunger.\n2 We are given that the neolithic people lived during a time when agriculture was in its infancy, meaning that they could not rely on agricultural methods to feed themselves; instead, they would have had to rely on hunting and fishing to procure their food.\n3. Looking at the different options given: God can't have been invoked in the neolithic time period as there was no formal religion or belief in deities.\n4. Therefore, option A is eliminated.\n5. Similarly, option B does not fit the context as Hunting and fishing are not options available to the neolithic man.\n6. The option C - pick a plant does mention plants, but the focus is on the act of hunting or fishing, which is not implied by the given option.\n7. Option D - plant seeds refers to the process of planting seeds, which is not necessarily the solution to hunger. \n8. Option E - cooking refers to the process of cooking food, not the type of food specifically being cooked.\n9. Coming back to looking at the choices: Planting seeds is the process of growing and cultivating plants through sowing seeds.\n10. The neolithic period was a time before agriculture developed, meaning that people would have had to rely primarily on hunting or fishing for food.\n11. As a result, planting seeds would not have been a suitable solution for the neolithic hunter-gatherer.\n12. The best description would be B - HUNT for food.\n13.

{"text": ": eat what? D: gather food E: pray\nOutput: 1.'The neolithic person' is a description that refers to the Stone Age.\n2. During this period, humans discovered the use of fire to cook their food.\n3. This discovery led to the development of tools such as stone axes, knives, and picks, which made it easier to extract raw materials from rocks and other surfaces.\n4. Hence, the'solution' to the problem of finding food was not only the discovery of fire but also to use tools like rocks to extract food.\n5. Thus, the question is asking about the'stars' (the word used in the context) that were used to extract food from nature during this period.\n6. So, from the context, the answer should probably be 'A: rocks'.\n7. However, the given options list 'pray' as the'solution' of the problem, which clearly contradicts the context.\n8. So, from the provided options only 'Rocks or other stones' is an appropriate and correct choice.\nSo the final correct answer is B: rocks or other stones\n\nInput: Sam was looking for the best way to describe a situation to her friend.

{"text": ": grow food D: build a kitchen with a stove\nOutput: 1.) From the information, we can deduce the following: The term 'neolithic' refers to a period of time that falls between the stone and iron ages. 2. This period focused on the development and use of primitive agriculture, which suggests that hungry neolithic people were likely to have used their knowledge of agriculture to eat, or 'grow food'.\n3. From this understanding, we can eliminate options such as 'hunt for food' and 'build a kitchen with a stov' because they do not accurately reflect the actions of a hunter-gatherer society that primarily relied on hunting and gathering food.\n4. However, the term 'grow food' cannot be answered without more information about what was used to grow the food. So, it's essential to look at the available options to determine the correct answer choice.\n5. Based on the information in bold, it can be stated that options A (eating food) and option D (building/constructing kitchen appliances) do not match the statement given.\n6. Therefore, we are left with two options which match: options B and C.\n7. Option B 'grow food' is the best answer choice because it is the only option that is related to the term 'cultivation'.\nSo the final answer will be : B: grow food\n\nInput: After the accident they were covered with what?

Bandages are typically used to cover wounds and injuries from the accident, however, we don't know if the people involved in the accident had any injuries or wounds, so it is not definitive that they were covered with bandages.\n6.

{"text": ": wait for the solution D: pray E: cook their own food\nOutput: 1) The answer to this question can be found through using inferential reasoning.\n2. Inferential thinking involves making logical deductions based on available contextual information.\n3. First, the statement \"The neolithic person\" provides a certain setting as well as a starting point for the problem, while the follow-up question indicates the solution.\n4. From inferring the context of the question, which includes the setting of the neolithic period and the presence of hunting and foraging as a main source of food for these ancient humans, we can understand that our answer must relate to either hunting or foraging.\n5. In this specific context, the idea of cooking one's own food is also somewhat relevant, since cooking would have been done over open fires, which were in existence in the neolithic periods.\n6. Therefore, we can infer that our answer is likely to be either E: cook food, C: hunt or D: Forge.\n7. Although \"Forage\" is sometimes used as the general term for looking for and collecting wild food, it does not necessarily carry any suggestion of cooking it.\n8. While \"hunting\" carries the idea of preparing food for oneself, this may also not exactly be the context of this question.\n9. This leaves us with three options.\n10. First, \"gratitude\" does not necessarily convey the idea of overcoming a problem or finding a solution, nor does it apply to food, but it may be considered more in the context of daily life, which is not what this question is asking for.\n11. Second, \"Wait for a solution\" does not seem to be an applicable answer choice since it suggests waiting without taking any action, which contradicts the idea of solving a problem.\n12. Finally, we are left with the most probable answer choice which is \"find food\" or \"cook food\", both of which point to actions that can be performed and which can solve the problem of finding food for neolithic hunters and gatherers. \n13. Therefore, this answer choice is the most likely to be correct - C: cook or forge food.\nSo the final aanswer is C: cook or forage food", "answer": " 1600"}

{"text": ": buy food D: pray for what they desired E: ask someone to help them\nOutput: 1: First, we interpret the question as asking for a solution to hunger, which is a common problem faced by many people.\n2. Once we understand the context, now we consider the provided options, which vary in nature and relevance to the problem of hunger.\n3. Option A could represent thanking God, which is not a solution to hunger directly but a potential way to deal with it.\n4. Option B could represent hunting for food, which is a direct solution to hunger but would require skill, luck, and effort.\n5. Option C, buying food, may be an indirect solution to hunger since it involves some form of monetary exchange.\n6. Option D could represent praying for what they desired, which is a general form of asking for help or support.\n7. Option D could represent asking someone to help, which is a specific form of asking for help.\n8. When we look at the options, we see that option D corresponds to option E in terms of directly addressing the issue of hunger, which is our desired solution.\n9. Therefore the solution to the question presented is indeed D: \"ask someone to help\".", "answer": " 370"}
{"text": ": catch a rabbit D: steal food E: pray\nOutput: 1) The question asks about a neolithic person who is hungry, and the options suggest different possible solutions - thanks, hunting, catching a rabbit, stealing food, and praying.\n2) Hunting refers to the pursuit of an animal for food, while catching a rabbit implies the same - seeking and capturing a rabbit to fill the hunger.\n3) Stealing suggests theft, which implies taking something unlawfully; pray means to request something from a superior being.\n4) Based on these clues, we can deduce the most likely option to be chosen: hunting.\n5) The question specifically asks about a Neolithic person who lived over 10,000 years ago as they were in the Stone Age.\n6) The options mentioned are either not relevant to this period of history or not feasible given their environment and technology.\n7) Therefore, the most suitable option for the provided question context is C (hunt for food)\nSo the final answer to the problem is C: hunt for food\n\nInput: If someone is asking for the time it means they want what? Choices: clock A: the time B: a reason C: explanation D: a date E: reason to be late\nOutput: 1.) The question asks about someone who wants to know the time and what it means, so it's essential to understand the context and clues provided before making a decision.\n2.) The options given are: Clock, Reason, Explanation, Date (and Reason to be late).\n3.) There's also a pun in the question: The question asks for the time (CLOCK) and what it means (what time is it)\n\n4.) So, the options Reason, Explanition and Date are incorrect as they do not make any sense.\n5.) The options Clock and Reason to be late are also incorrect as they don't make sense contextually: Clock is a device which tells what time it is, so it doesn't make sense to ask for it. Reason to be late makes no sense contextually, as a person cannot have a reason to be late.\n\n6.) The most likely option is: A (the time)\n\nSo the final answer here is A (the time", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": ": make an oven D: boil the food E: make bread\nOutput: 1.) The key words are 'the neolithic person', who we can assume to be hungry and in search of a solution to the problem. \n2.) Looking at the options provided - 'thank god','hunt for food','make an oven','boil the food' and'make bread', we can deduce that the neolithic person could have resorted to praying to god, looking for food in the wild, making an oven, boiling the food in the oven or making bread as a solution to their hunger.\n3.) We can infer that out of these choices, the options 'thank god','boil the food','make bread' are not probable solutions as these would require either the presence of god or fire which would be unusual for the neolithic era where the methods of cultivation and baking were not yet known.\n4.) Based on this reasoning, the remaining three options are valid and seem plausible as solutions, though they do not necessarily confirm to the 'neolithic' era due to the presence of ovens in the neolithic times.\n5.) Therefor, the most probable solution to the neolithic man's problem would be'make bread'.\nSo the final answer should be, \"C: make bread\"", "answer": " 170"}
{"text": ": kill wild animals D: wait for the hunting team E: eat plants\nOutput: 1.. The Neolithic Period refers to a time period in human history when people began to live in settled communities and to practice agriculture and animal husbandry.\n2. The option A, 'thank god' is not applicable and cannot be a valid choice in the context provided.\n3. Option C 'killing wild animals' refers to hunting, which was one way that neolithic people fed themselves.\n4. Option D 'waiting for the hunting team' refers to a practice where hunters would go to hunt for food and return to the village to share with the community.\n5. Option E 'eating plants' was one way of living during the Neolithic Period.\n6. From these options, the correct answer is D: wait for the Hunting Team.\nSo the final  answer is D: wait  for the  hunting team", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": pray for food D: start a revolution E: protest\nOutput: 1: The question provides information about the neolithic person and their desire for food.\n2: Considering the choices: The use of the word God here may suggest the person could have turned to religion or prayer to find a solution.\n3: The word revolution might not be related to finding a solution specifically, but a revolution can involve protests or demonstrations, so this could be a possible option.\n4: The word Protest indicates the person might have taken action to make their needs known and demand their rights, such as protesting and demonstrating, so this could potentially be an appropriate choice.\n5: Based on the context, it'seems that neither \"thank god\" nor \"hunt for food\" is an appropriate way to address the problem since they do not necessarily involve taking action to find a solution. \"Pray for food\" is possible, but might not be the most effective way to resolve the problem.\n6: The only appropriate choice that makes sense based on the context is \"Pray for food\", but with the important caveat that it doesn't necessarily resolve the problem because it could just be a form of giving up and hoping for something to happen.\n7: Therefore, the answer is likely E: pray for food with the important nuance that it's not a definite solution to the problem.\n\n#\nInput: What does the idiom, \"A good deed goes a long way\", mean? Choices: \nA: A good deed is a kindness to another B:  A good deed is something that lasts for a long time C:  The meaning of a good deed is important D: A good deed can make a big impact on a person\nOutput: 1) The idiom \"A good deed is go a long way\" means that you will get your reward later by helping, and it will be worth it.\n2) The idiom is saying that a good deed could continue to be felt for a long time afterwards, \n\n3) The idiom is making reference to the idea that good deeds can have significant and enduring positive effects on others.\n4) The idiom refers to kindness and other positive traits that people feel will have a long-lasting impact and meaning for the person they help.\n\n5) Therefore, the most appropriate answer", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": ": plant rice D: pray for food E: hunt for animals\nOutput: 1) The neolithic period refers to ancient times when humans had just begun to develop advanced civilization and technology.\n2) As for the nature of choice options, we can easily exclude \"B: hunt for food\" as it's a bit too specific to the neolithic period and doesn't provide any new information or additional insights.\n3) We can also eliminate \"D: pray for food\" as it involves religion and isn't relevant or connected to the neolith-ic period or the hunt for food.\n4) Option \"C: plant rice\" could potentially be relevant, but it may lack depth and comprehensiveness.\n5) Option \"E: hunt for animals\" could be a possible relevant option during this time period, as animals were hunted for food.\n6) Based on the information and reasoning, answer choice \"C: plant rice\", can be eliminated as a candidate choice, because it is missing specific and pertinent information.\n7) However, the term \"hunt for animals\" could potentially be a good choice, as it's something that was done in the neolithic age, and its association with the word \"hunt\" could imply that hunting for animals would be considered as an option.\n8) Therefore, the answer would have to be \"E: hunt animals\".\nSo the final answers are E: hunt for food & hunt for animals\n\nInput: What is the best way to express yourself using your artistic skills?

{"text": ": gather D: build shelter E: pray\nOutput: 1.) First, we need to comprehend the nature of the neolithic person. They were hunter-gatherers who survived through the hunting and gathering of food.\n2.) Given this context, we can assume that solving the hunger problem was their primary concern, and thus they likely had multiple options to do so.\n3.) Options A & B both reflect their approach to the meal problem.\n4.) Option A \"thanked God\" is rather unlikely, since they probably didn't believe in a higher power.\n5.) Options C & D \"hunting and gathering\" are the main solutions used by the neolithic people. Therefore, we can assume their hunger problems are likely to be solved by options C & D.\n6.) For option E (pray) to be answered, we need to know the time period it is being asked about. Is it earlier than the neolithic times? If we consider the time frames, option E would likely relate to post-neolithic times.\n7.) From the given information, it can be concluded that the most likely solution offered is D: build shelter.\nSo the final solution is D: build shelter\n\nInput: The old woman was a 60s, it is true that she was: Choices:  A.

It is the relationship between a person and what age: \"The old woman WAS a 60s\".\n3. This relationship is not obvious, as it is neither the present nor the future tense.\n4. We can assume that it is the 60's generation or the 60' period.\n5. Now let\u2019s consider the options:\n6. options A, B & D are not the correct answers since the 60\u2019 period refers to the sixties in general and does not mention a specific person.\n7.

{"text": ": use a cookbook D: boil an egg E: grow potatos\nOutput: 1) The question refers to a neolithic person, who is described as being \"hungry.\" This indicates that the person is likely to have needed to find a solution to feed themselves.\n2) The available options to the question provide solutions to feed oneself.\n3) Option A: \"Thank God\" seems to be a bit of an off-culture choice.\nOption B: \"Hunt for food\" seems to be fitting to the context, as Neolithic people might have hunted animals to feed themselves.\nOption C: \"Use a cookbook\" doesn't really seem to be a logical choice given this context. Neolithic people did not have access to cookbooks. They were likely to cook their food using the knowledge passed on by their ancestors or through trial and error.\nOption D: \"Boil an Egg\" is a possible solution to the person's hunger, as eggs could be cooked and consumed.\nOption E: \"Grow potatoes\" also seems to be a feasible choice for the person to resolve their hunger.\nAfter considering all available options, it can be inferred that \"boil an egg\" is the most fitting choice out of the available options.\n\nSo the final answer boil an egg\n\nInput: To ___ is to be able to perform any task on time, even in stressful or unexpected situations. Choices:  A. multitask B. multitasking C. multitasked D. multitasked E. multitask\nOutput: 1.) First, the context of the question is significant to the understanding of the options. The question mentions that multitasking is \"to do it at all... in unexpected situations.\"\nThis implies that not all tasks can be multitasked, only specific ones, as not all tasks can be performed at the same time or in unexpected situations.\n2.) The options must be relevant, given the context of the question. The available options are multitask, multitasking, multitasked, multitasked.\n3.) The options indicate that \"multitasking\" and \"multitask\" appear to be the same or equivalent.\n4.) \"Multitask\" as a single word is shorter than \"multitasking", "answer": " 38"}

One can infer from the options that the person had little to no choice but to \"eat whatever there was\", as all other options require some form of preparation, hunting, or other activity.\n3. Looking at the options one can rule out A: Thank God, B: Hunt for food, C: Find the food as they are not really solution.\n4. Of the remaining options, E: Make it yourself only requires the person to take action through preparation, which seems to fit the constraints of the question.\n5.

However, from the given options, only \"error\" and \"shortage\" do not involve a certain amount of money.\n2. Option E: Fraud, can be ruled out as it is unrelated to the question.\n3. In the context of a sale or discount, only Option A: Scam or Option B: Discount could plausibly be a type of \"sale\" and fit the constraints of the problem.\n4. However, the question uses the word \"think\" to suggest that there may be a different explanation, which suggests an issue with the way the sale is being made.\n5. Hence, option E: Shortage is incorrect because there seems an insufficient number of available shirts to match the demand.\n6. Another incorrect option is Option C: Error since it involves a human error, which can result in a discount or sale being applied incorrectly.\n7. Option B: Discount can be eliminated from consideration because it is a common term used to describe a sale or discount in the context of certain goods", "answer": " 8"}

The options then suggest various ways in which they could solve this issue, with A saying that they would thank G-D, which was unlikely to be an option at the time and likely to solve the problem.\n3. The remaining options then indicate different types of actions they could take.\n4. The correct option of D: kill the animals would be the most logical as they were in that era and had no access to any modern technologies to solve for the food crisis.\n5.

The option \"create agriculture\" looks like a plausible answer, but it seems to lack relevance as the options available have to do with solving the problem of hunger.\n3. Similarly, the answer choice of \" hunt for food\" is relevant, but again, doesn't directly address the problem of hunger and seems to suggest that the character in question hunted for food to have something to eat.\n4. In the absence of any other relevant options, the answer is more likely to be C: \"hunt for food\".\n5. Although the answer is based on the current context, it doesn't mean that it cannot change in the future.

Looking at the options given, we can see there are varying descriptions of how the Neolithics would have sourced food.\n4. Option A 'Thank God' is not a solution, as it isn't anything that the Neolithics could have done.\n5. Option 'B: hunt for food' speaks to the process of hunting and gathering food, which seems to have been a practice used by the Neolithics.\n6. Option D 'Create fire' could have been used in a range of ways, such as making fire and cooking food, or using the fire to signal an approaching storm or attracting an animal. \n7. Option E 'Create weapons' could describe the way in which the Neolithics created tools or weapons to hunt for food.\n8. Option C 'Make some' is a vague description of what food could have been made. \n9.

For instance, thanking god may not be an appropriate solution for a hungru neolithic person as they may not be aware of the concept of god. Similarly, hunting for food in the given context would only temporarily alleviate the hunger pangs and not be a long-term solution.\n5) The best solution in this context would be E: making a fire. Making a fire would not only ensure that the person gets food to eat, but it also provides a permanent solution to the problem of food scarcity. Moreover, the smoke from the fire can also aid in hunting for prey, making it an efficient solution overall.", "answer": " 14"}
{"text": ": gather food D: build a new shelter E: build a new food source\nOutput: 1) The question speaks to the neolithic period, a time in human history defined by the advent of technological advancements and developments, such as the use of tools, fire, and agriculture.\n2) The neolithic period is the beginning of human civilization, characterized by the use of stone, pottery, and other technologies.\n3) As the neolithic person is hungry, it is unlikely that they were thankful for the food they already had, thus option A (Thank God) is not applicable.\n4) Option B (hunting) also seems to have no relevance to the answer. As the neolithi person is hungry, hunting is not likely their immediate solution.\n5) Option C (gathering food) does not directly apply, as this is a way of obtaining food that people can use and build a new shelter, not necessarily eat in its raw form.\n6) If the neolithic people wanted to solve their hungry the most logical solution would be building a new food source, which is option D.\n7) Option E (building a new shelter) could be a way of solving an ongoing hungry problem by building shelter and storing food. However, this would not directly result in a new source of food.\n8) Therefore, from the given options, the answer would be D (building a food source).\nSo the final answer\nis D: building a new food source.\n\nInput: The mall was built in order to have what?

{"text": ": cook D: kill E: collect sticks for fire\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about the solution to a hunger problem faced by \"the Neolithic person.\"\n2) Hunting for food is an important part of Neolithic life and was a means of survival for people during this time.\n3. Making a fire is another important part of Neolittic life, as it was used for cooking and keeping warm.\n4) Since both hunting and making a fire are important aspects of Neolithic societies, it makes sense to expect one of these things to be the solution to the hunger problem.\n5. We can eliminate options A (thanks to God) and E (collecting sticks for fire) as both don't directly solve the hunger problem. \n6. The option I D (to kill) seems to be a possible solution, but the phrase \"so what was their solution\" implies that the solution has already been identified as part of the question, which contradicts option I.\n7. Therefore options B (hunt for food) and C (cook) are the most logical choices as they're directly related to the solution and provide a means of combating hunger.\n8. After considering this conclusion, the answer is likely B: Hunt for food and C: Cook.\nSo the final answers are B: hunt for foos and C: cook\n\nInput: A baby penguin will do what every time it sees an adult that isn't its parent?

Choices A: Last longer.  B: Work well.  C: Do as good as you want.  D: Pay their employees a living salary.\nOutput:\n1. If the company is weak and in financial distress, then it shouldn't expect to \"last longer.\"\n2. However strong a company may be, it's not assured that its products or services would \"work well.\"\n3. A company that is not doing well might \"do as good as you want,\" but it's unlikely to be able to ensure the kind of quality that customers require.\n4. Similarly, a weak company might need to lay off employees to survive, making it less likely that it can pay a living wage.", "answer": " 27"}
{"text": ": pray D: cultivate E: go hunting\nOutput: 1) First, we can eliminate the unlikely options for solving food problems such as pray, thank god, or hunt for food.\n2) Cultivating as a solution for food problem is also unlikely as it does not match the requirements and options provided.\n3) Therefore, leaving us with options D and E.\n4) Choice D sounds plausible as cultivating would mean growing crops to generate food. \n5) However, option E 'go hunting' resonates with the neolithic person being hungry. \n6) Also, 'go hunting' seems to be a more suitable solution to a problem like 'food problem'.\n7) Thereby, the correct answer is E: go hunting.\nSo the final anwser is E: go hunting \n\nInput: Your local grocery store likely carries what kind of frogs? Choices: \nA: poisonous B: non-slimy C: poisonless D: slimy E: poisonous and non-slimy\nOutput: 1.) The options are given in pairs with only two being plausible. 2.) Option A 'Poisonous frogs' are unlikely since there are no poisonous frogs found in grocery stores.\n3.) Options B and option C are equally applicable as slimy and non-slim frogs are found in grocery store.\n4.)Option D 'Poisonous frogl' seems odd since poisonous frogs are found in tropical and exotic rainforests and are not likely to be found in grocery shops near you.\n5.)

{"text": ": gather food D: grow food E: pray\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" could be used to refer to a specific hunter-gatherer-forager culture. However, this is not specified in the question.\n2. \"Hungry\" suggests that the person's food supply is depleted.\n3. If the person had access to farming and agriculture, they would likely be able to cultivate their own food supply.\n4. While hunting and foraging for food is possible in a neolithic setting, given the lack of agriculture and farming, it is potentially difficult and time-consuming. \n5. Therefore, options C and D are most likely to be chosen by a hunter-gather and forager.\n6. \"Thank god\" may represent a religious approach or expression of belief in a higher power, suggesting an appeal or prayer, but may be inappropriate as an action or course of action for a hunter-gathers.\n7. Growing food may be a longer-term solution to being hungry, however, gathering food from the land could be a quicker and more efficient solution.\n8. Therefore, the most likely option is D: grow food.\nSo the final comment given, given the context, the answer is D grow food.\n\nInput: What type of animal was once the symbol of the United States?

{"text": ": pray D: catch fish E: pray\nOutput: 1 This question contains a grammatical and semantic error. The pronoun, 'the neolithic person' does not refer to an object or verb, and its placement is incorrect. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret the question to determine the correct answer.\n2. From other contextual clues, the options that make sense are:\n3. A) Thank God - While it is possible that this option refers to the neolithic person, it is not in the given context.\n4. B) Hunt for food - This option also refers to the modern day hunters of food, and therefore does not apply to the neolithics.\n5. C) Pray - This option could refer to a religious act or a verbal supplication requesting help from God, which fits the context based on the question's premise.\n6. Option D) Catch fish is a possible interpretation, but other contextual details would suggest that the hunt would be for land animals.\n7. Option-E: Pray - The context of the question suggests the most plausible answer, as the neolithic hunter would have probably been reliant on God for their successful hunting.\n8. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is E: Pray.\nSo the final word answer is E: PRAY\n\nInput: The sun can do what? Choices: A: light B: illuminate C: shine D: warm E: burn F: radiate\nOutput: 1) We can see that the options have the words \"light,\" \"illuminate,\" and \"shine.\" These words all have similar meanings, and they all describe how the sun can be used to illuminate or brighten a space.\n2) The options include \"warm,\" \"burn,\" and \"radiate.\" These words are somewhat different from the other words and describe other aspects of the sun.\n3) The sun can \"shine\" on people, light up an object, or \"illuminate\" a space and cause it to \"glow.\" The sun can also \"warm\" the ground or \"burn\" people when it gets too close. The sun can also \"radiate\" heat and light in all directions.\n4) Therefore, the answer is A: light.\nSo the final sentence answer is A: light", "answer": " 32"}

Based out the context of the question, the author is highlighting the inefficient solution used by the man during the Neolithic era.\n4. The solutions listed in the answers are all valid for the given era.\n5. They can be summarized as follows: Thank God: Prayer doesn't imply food. It's more for peace and well-being.\n6. Build a structure: It's unclear what structure they refer to as there was no technology to construct anything.\n7.Pray: More of a form of gratitude rather than a solution to food insecurity.\n8.Hunt for food: Although not in-efficient, it is an arduous and time-consuming task.\n9.Eat roots: Although some settlements grew vegetables and fruits, the solution doesn't seem plausible and may not be feasible.\n10.The answer to the question is more likely to be D: eat roots, as this is the only feasible answer among the choices provided. \n11.So the final answer is  D: eat roots\n\nInput: In my youth, music was the only thing I was into, though I've never been good to play what?

{"text": ": invent fire D: invent bread E: start industry\nOutput: 1 The question provides information about hunger as a problem faced by ancient peoples.\n2. The given options are about the solution to the problem, which could be the invention of something or discovering something.\n3. The given context indicates that the correct answer refers to the invention of something, rather than simply discovering something.\n4. Options A and B: \"thank god\" and \"hunt for food\" are not solutions to the problem because they don't refer to invention or creation, but rather to acknowledgment of or dependence on the divine or nature.\n5. Options C and D: \"invent fire\" and \"invent bread\" both refer to the invention or creation of something. \"Invent fire\" refers to the use of fire for cooking or warmth, which is an effective way of preparing food, but not necessarily a solution to hunger. \"Invent bread\" refers to the invention or discovery of a food that is made from flour, but does not solve the problem of hunger, as bread can be enjoyed with other foods.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer between Option E: \"start industry\" and D: \"invention of bread\" is E as \"the start of industry\" has a more general and broader applicability than \"bread\".\n7. So the answer to the question is E: start industry\nSo the final answer D: invention of bread should be changed to D: start industry", "answer": " 8"}

The context of the question makes it clear that the neolithic person is experiencing a problem or difficulty, and their solution, as suggested by the options, is either to use fishing or plant/grow. However, the option A 'thank god' seems like an unusual solution for the given context.\n3. The option B 'hunt for food' seems to be the best solution among the others because it's a general practice that involves hunting for food.\n\n4. The neolithic people are described as hunters and gatherers, so hunting for food would be a plausible solution for their problems.\n5. However, the question doesn't specify that the neoliths were only hunters and gatherers. They could also have been engaged in other activities such as farming or fishing, making options C 'plant' and option E 'fish' possible choices for the problem that needs a solution.\n6.

Being hungry was a common problem experienced by people during this era. The question asks about the solution to this problem.\n4. Considering the options: \"thank god\" does not seem to be a logical solution to the problem.\n5. Option\"B: hunt for food\" can be a logical step towards providing sustenance, however it requires access to food sources which may have been limited in this era.\n6. \"C: go outside\" does not relate to the problem at hand.\n7. \"Option 'D: be sad\" seems like a logical answer to the problem as it provides an empathetic response, which is a crucial part of human existence. \n8. Therefore, the answer could be E: Start working based on the reasoning. \n9. People needed to hunt and gather food, prepare fire, grind grain.

Then, we look at the given options: \n3. A: we can rule out option A \"thank god\" as unreasonable for solutioning such as problem.\n5. Option C \"wait for rain\" does not indicate what the Neolithic person may have done to solve their food problem. \n6. Similarly, we can rule out option D \"pray for food\" as it is not a reasonable, fact-based solution to the given example.\n7. Option B \"hunt for food\" can be a solution to the problem the Neolithic people faced as they could have hunted for food to alleviate their food shortage. However, it's not mentioned in the passage, and the answer is required to be a solution the Neolithic peoples may have used to solve the problem.\n8. Then, there is option E \"build a farm\". \n9. This is the most likely solution the Neolithics people may have used as building of farms is often seen as a solution to food shortages.\n10.

{"text": ": plant seeds D: pray E: pray to God\nOutput: 1) The neolithic period was a time in human history when people transitioned from a nomadic hunting-and-gathering lifestyle to one of farming and settled communities.\n2. The question asks about the possible solution chosen by a person from neolithic times when they were \"hungry\".\n3. The possible options given are: \"thanking God\", \"planting seeds\", and \"hunting for food\".\n4. Based on the context of the question and the choices provided, we can infer that the person is hungry and desperate to find food.\n5. The first option \"thanking God\" is not a typical solution that would be considered when hungry and seeking food.\n6. The second option \"planting seeds\" is a practical solution that could have been considered by a person from neolidhic times, as it requires time, resources, and technical knowledge.\n7. The third option \"hunting for\" is also a practical solution that could be considered by a person from the neolithec time period and is commonly associated with the nomadic hunting-and gathering lifestyle.\n8.

A hungry person may have recently taken one too many meals without enough food that day.\n3 The first choice A is not gramatically suitable.\n4. The second choice B is incorrect because the person is not starving. While hunting for food may be one solution, people can only hunt for food when they are hungry because that's when they have the energy to hunt.\n5. The third choice D can be a solution, but it doesn' t make sense because to make food one first needs the ingredients.\n6 The fourth choice E is gramatically incorrect because the person has not eaten anything for a certain period so that option is not valid.\n7.

{"text": ": gather fruit D: hunt down wild animals E: get a job\nOutput: 1st thing to note is that the question is asking about a Nolithic person being hungry.\n2. Now, Nolithic meant a time pre-pastoralism, when humans lived in tribes and hunter gatherers.\n3. Hunting and gathering of food was how people got food, and is also an option.\n4. The next step would be to look at the options which do not align with nolithic tribes living, being hungry, and hunting.\n5. The only options left are \"get a job\" and \"hunt down wild animals\".\n6. \"hunt down wild animal\" is a process that does not seem to align to the tribes of the neolithic age, that is, a time before the pastoralism. Hence, option \"Hunt down wild animals\" can be eliminated.\n7. \"Get a job\" does not seem to be an option in the nolithic time. There are no employers, factories or companies in those times. There are no jobs since it was a time of hunting and gathering. Hence, option \"Get a job\" can be eliminated also.\n8. Therefore, the correct choice is \"C: Gather fruit\"\nSo the final answer would be C: Gather fruit\n\nInput: It was the right thing to give the little boy a teddy bear.

We can eliminate the possibility that the writer is either asking about a Teddy bear for her or for him from the above facts.\n3. The next step is to eliminate any choices that do not fit in the context i.e. The teenage girl is not the little boy, it would be inappropriate to give her a teddy bear.\n4. And lastly we rule out 'a teddy bear' as well which is the least ambiguous choice.\n5.

In modern days the time people are hungry also makes solution to the food problem not the same as they hunted for food.\n3. The problem is specifically discussed in hungry people case but not as wide as 'when people are hungry'.\n4. There were many cultures existed around then and also food problems arose but the questions is asking about the neolithic period.\n5. The neolithic period is characterized by farming and domesticating animals as well as hunting and gathering.\n6. It's clear that food was not grown everywhere as some regions were not suitable for farming.\n7. Food was scarce especially during harsh winter and they had to hunt for food.\n8. Now, option A: thank god - would make a sense if question was about modern days but not for neolithic period with people hunting to survive.\n9. Option B: hunt for fish - is logical but it makes more sense to hunt more for meat than fish. Also, this doesn't really solve hunger the only way, which is to make sure having enough food to eat.\n10. Option C: go hunting - isn't logical as it is part of solution, not a full solution.\n11. Option D: bake bread - is also logic but it also takes time and is not a solution to hunger.\n12. Option E: grow food - is the only full solution of the hunger problem, which was the issue of neolithic period as well.\n13. Therefore, answer is: E: Grow food.\nSo the final Answer is E: Grow food\n\nInput: Every man's ideal is different, they seek what is most beneficial to them, as what?

{"text": ": work hard D: starve E: pray\nOutput: 1\" First, we need to look at the context of the question: The neolith is described as \"hungry\", suggesting that they were experiencing a lack or shortage of adequate food supply.\n2. In order to provide an answer to the question, we must assume that the neolithic person had no other option for obtaining food, and they did not live in such a society where hunting was possible.\n3. The context of the question indicates that the neolith should not pray. There are no religious factors.\n4. The options suggest that the neoliths may choose to:\n4.1 hunt for food (option B)\n4.2 work hard (option D)\n4.3 starve (option E)\n4.4 thank God (option A)\n5. If we take into account the current context, we can eliminate certain options on the bases.\n6. For example, hunt for food is eliminated because the neoliths had no other option.\n7. Similarly, we can eliminate other options as they may not be appropriate given the context.\n8. Option C \"work hard\" is eliminated because it contradicts with the neolithic age. During the neolith, people were not supposed to work hard for food.\n9. Option D \"starve\" is eliminated because the question is concerned about food supply and not food consumption.\n10. Finally, after examining the remaining options, option F (thank God) is eliminated because the context does not suggest a religious solution.\n11. Hence the logical answer is A (thank God). God does not have any relevance or reference in the question.\nSo the final correct answer would be A: thank god.\n\nInput: He got the job, that's why he had so much free time to write, what does writing refer to?

After that, we should analyze the context of the rest of the question.\n3. From the context, we can assume that writing could be referring to the writing of a book or novel.\n4. The question \"that's why", "answer": " 42"}
{"text": ": gather food D: starve E: grow food in the ground\nOutput: 1 First, we understand the terms Neolithic person, hunter-gatherer, farmer. These concepts refer to the Stone Age, a period in which people mainly lived as hunter-gatherers and few people grew food in the ground.\n2. The text specifies that the neolithic person lived during the stone age.\n3. Therefore, it's likely that the Neolithic person was a hunter-gather.\n4. The question specifies that the Neolithik person was hungry so clearly they were unable to gather enough food.\n5. The options B, D and E are not likely to have been available for a Neolithik hunter-gather, and are unlikely to be a solution to being hungry.\n6. Looking at A and C, we understand that A is an example of what a Neolithik person might say in today's context.\n7. B is not a logical solution to being hungry as a hunter-gatherer, but C is a viable and logical solution.\n8. Therefore, the answer according to context clues is C: Gather Food.\nSo the final answe is C: Gather food", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": ": invent food D: pray for food\nOutput: 1st: The context is important. It's the neolithic era, which means they didn't have advanced technology or modern food production systems.\n\n2. So, they wouldn't have been able to 'invent food'.\n\n3. Praying for food wouldn't have helped either, as they didn't have a society or advanced religion yet (neolithic refers to pre-historic people).\n\n4. They would have had to hunt for food, which they would have done with primitive tools.\nThis would have taken a lot of time and effort.\n\n5. It's unlikely that they would have felt hungry very often, though.\n\n6. This is because they would likely have been able to hunt for food regularly in order to survive.\n\n7.

Invented fire is a solution to a practical need, such as the need for warmth, cooking, and defense. \n7) Option D \"eat grass\". Eating grass is not a solution to a serious hunger problem. \n8) Option E \"kill animals\". Killing animals is a solution to a serious food shortage. In the Neolithic age, it was necessary for humans to kill animals in order to feed themselves and survive.\n9) Therefore, the most appropriate answer to the question is C: \"Invented Fire\".\nSo the final Answer is C: Invented Fire", "answer": " 448000"}

{"text": ": be vegetarian D: raise chickens E: be a carnivore\nOutput: 1._ The question presents a scenario where a neolithic person felt hungry, and asks us to identify their solution for their hunger, given the choice of options.\n2. The answer is unlikely to be option A, because it doesn't seem logical to be thankful for your hunger in such a situation.\n3. Option E 'to be a carnivorous' is also unlikely because this suggests to be a meat-eater, which was not a common practice during the neolithic period.\n4. Option B 'hunt for food' is another plausible option. It has been commonly associated with humans in the stone age, during which the concept of farming was not yet developed.\n5. Option C 'be a vegetarian' sounds like a reasonable choice, since it involves the cultivation of crops and grains for food.\n6. As a result, the answer seems most likely to be option C 'be a vegetaran'.\nSo the final answer for the question 'What was the neolithic person's solution to the problem?' is C: be a vegetarian.\n\nInput: People in South Korea prefer to eat what?

{"text": ": eat CROPPED plants D: create fires E: grow crops\nOutput: 1) The question provides information about the state of people in the neolithic age, specifically their solution to hunger. It also informs us that people from the neolithic did not have to look for food every single day or constantly go hunting like their ancestors before them because this was the solution to their problem.\n2) The hungry person's solution for their problem was to eat what they had available to them, the plants, which they grew.\n3) Given the information, the most fitting choice to the hungry person's (now referred to as neolithic person or neolithic) solution is  option E - Create Crops - aka grow crops - which fits their predicament as what they had to eat was the crop they grew.\n4) We can compare the options of growing food, hunting it, thanking god and finding a solution.\n5) Growing crops and thanking god are extreme solutions to the person's problem, so these options are quickly rejected.\n6) Hunting it and finding a solution are reasonable approaches and even a possibility as the hungry person'd have to do something about their problem. However, in the neolithi age, one grew, harvested and made sure they always had food to eat which is reflected in the solution to the question and the answer is  option E - grow crops.\n7) Based on the evidence, it's clear the correct answer to the question\n8) is E - grow crops\nSo the final answer to the question is E - grow cropl\n\nInput: Which one of the following is an example of food energy?

{"text": ": find food D: build a fire E: build another stone tool\nOutput: 1.\"Neolithic man\" typically refers to early human communities that began to live in settled villages and began to practice agriculture and animal husbandry around 10,000 years ago.\n2. Neolithic man did not possess advanced technology and were not able to rely on machines or tools to solve issues or problems.\n3. Being hungry is a common human experience, and Neolithic man would have had to find a solution to their food scarcity that was within their capabilities, which would have most likely involved hunting and searching for food.\n4. Looking for food is a logical solution, and thanking god cannot be completely ruled out, but it is not logically a solution to the problem of hunger when you do not possess food.\n\n5. Constructing a fire is also reasonable, but this is a solution that requires time and effort, which would not have been within Neolithic man's capabilities during his/her time of need.\n6. Building a stone tool could potentially be a solution, but considering that the tools were not necessarily sophisticated, it seems questionable that this would be a suitable solution.\n7. Based on these considerations, the answer choice seems to be either D: Build a Fire or option E: Find food.\n8. Option E is more likely because it is a more immediate or instantaneous solution to the problem of food scarcity, \n9. Moreover, as Neolithic man could not rely on machinery or tools to build fires or construct tools, it seems most likely that he/she would have turned to hunting or foraging for food first.\n10. Therefore, Neolithic man is likely to have solved the problem of hunger by hunting or foraging for available food sources, and not building a fire.\n11. The less likely option is Build a fire, so the correct options are Build a Fire or Find food.\n12. Therefore, the answer can either be D: Build a Fire, or E: Find food. \nSo the final answer was D: Build a Fire\n\n\n## Hints\n\nIt's quite likely that the questions will have more than one correct answer.

However, the question does refer to the neolithic period where agriculture was not yet a widespread practice.\n7) Option E \"pray\" could also not be considered a solution to the \"problem\" as it does not provide any tangible results that would be eaten.\n8) Therefore, based on the provided options, the most likely solution is C: \"prepare meals\".\n9) It would require a time frame for this option, which could be hours or days based on the food being prepared.\n10) Therefore, the \"problem\" could be related to the duration of time taken to prepare a meal within the neolithic era.\n11) Therefore, the final answer is C (prepare meal).\nSo the final answer C: prepare meal\n\nInput: What is the function of a door handle?

At this time, the average individual did not have access to prepared or packaged food products; instead, their primary source of food came from hunting or growing their own food.\n2) This suggests that the options might include hunting or growing their own garden.\n3) The term \"grow\" can mean different things, such as growing in height, growing stronger, or growing a plant. In this case, we can assume that the neolithic person grew their own food by planting and caring for a garden.\n4) This implies that the correct answer is option C: grow own food.\nSo the final answers are C: grow own food\n\nInput: What did a cape dorcaster eat in ancient times? Choices: 1: A: fish 2: B: insects 3: C: worms 4: D: caribou meat 5: E: wild berries\nOutput: 1: The \"cape dorcaster\" was a fish that was native to the Arctic Ocean and Atlantic waters around North America.\n2: The question suggests that the cape dorcaster was an important food source for indigenous people in North America in ancient times, and they used to rely on a variety of organic items such as fish, insects, worms, wild berries, and caribou meat for meals.\n3: Worms may be included in the variety of foods consumed by early inhabitants, but the question makes no specific mention of them.\n4: \"Caribou\" is a term used to describe certain species of deer, which may or may not have been included in ancient indigenous diet as one of their primary meals.\n5: Insects may be included in their diets, but in small amounts compared to other food items such as fish, worms, and berries.\n6: These options are all likely sources of sustenance for early indigenous people, with the cape dorcster being a major part of their diet.\n7: Given this information, option D, which includes these different foods,", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": grow some D: invent machines E: invent farming\nOutput: 1.)First, we can deduce the main point of the question based on the information provided. The neolithic period meant the prehistoric era of humans. Therefore, these were people who existed before the advent of machines and technology, implying that their solution was based on manual labor instead of invention.\n2.) The only options describing manual labor are A (thank God) and D (invent machines). \n3.) The option A (thank God), describes a person's prayer seeking to thank a higher power for any food available, which does not imply any effort on the part of the person seeking the food.\n4.) Therefore, D (invent machines) is the right answer.\nSo the final answer is D: invent machines\n\nInput: People want to get you to click their ad  so in order to do that they make it attractive.

{"text": ": barter D: pray to god E: go hungry\nOutput: 1.\u201cSolution\u201d, in this context, appears to suggest the specific actions taken by the neolithic people to acquire food.\n2.The question asks what the neolithic person did when they were hungry. They cannot have thanked god, prayed to god, or go hungry because they didn't have a god.\n3. Hunt for food could have been a potential option but would have been a temporary solution as it would have been necessary to do so on a frequent basis to acquire food. However, the neolithic period lasted for thousands of years.\n4. Barter is a form of trade that requires the exchange of goods or services, which the neolithic society wouldn't have had in abundance.\n5. Thus, the most likely solution that the neolithic humans would have taken is C: Barter.\nSo the final answers are C: Barter\n\nInput: What could you do if someone is not following the law? Choices:  None of the above\nOutput: 1\u201cWhat could you do if someone isn't following the law?\u201d\n2This question implies that there are actions that can be taken.\n3There is an assumption that law and lawlessness are both concepts that exist and can be defined within a given time frame.\n4It is also assumed that there are repercussions for breaking laws, as the question asks \u201cwhat could you do to stop someone breaking the law?\u201d\n5It is also expected that the question is not about laws regarding animals, because that would be covered under \"None of the above.\"\n6Therefore, the most likely answer is C: Tell the responsible authorities\nSo the final answers is C: Tell the authorities\n\nInput: He was late for work, but he didn't have anything in his mouth but he was still late. How is that possible?

{"text": ": kill an animal D: eat more E: go to a restaurant F: do without\nOutput: 1.) The neolithic people did not have an abundance of food, which could have caused their hunger.\n2.) The question specifically mentions the neolithic people who had to work hard for food and had only limited options.\n3.) From the provided choices, only four seem plausible - hunting for food, killing an animal, eating more food, or eating out at a restaurant.\n\n4.) Choice D: \"eating more\" seems to imply that they were eating food which would help them increase their energy levels for other activities, which is most likely not the case.\n5.) Likewise, choice E: \"eating out at a restaurant\" seems like an incorrect choice. They would likely hunt for food, kill their food, and cook it before eating since they were not the modern society who ate at restaurants.\n6.) Therefore, the options B, C, and F: \"hunt for food\", \"kill an animal\", and \"do without\" should be considered.\n7.) The question seems to be asking for the correct solution among these three based on the context, which implies a logical order of preferences.\n\n8.) Choice B: \"hunting for food\" is likely to be the most preferable solution to them since it would have provided them with fresh meat, which could have satisfied hunger.\n\n9.) Choice C: \"killing an animal\" and choice F: \"do without\" would not have been preferable solutions as they would either be risky and involve a lot of hard work or cause them to go hungry altogether.\n\n10.) There is still uncertainty about whether B or F is the correct answer, but it is more likely B: hunting for food, which is the correct solution to their hunger, thus the answer is B: hunting for food.\n\nSo the final answer would be B: hunting for food", "answer": " 258"}
{"text": ": find something to eat D: dig for food E: pray to god\nOutput: 1 The question is asking about the solution used by the Neolithic person to the problem of food scarcity.\n2. The problem discussed is of food scarcity, and food scarcity is usually associated with a lack of food.\n3. The main options provided are associated with a hunt for something to eat as shown by the context-\n4. Hunt for the food involves hunting an animal to extract the actual food required.\n5. Although option A talks about a 'thank', it is in the form of 'God' which can be misinterpreted as a prayer.\n6. Likewise, option B talks about a hunt for 'food' which can be interpreted similarly to hunt for a specific type of food.\n7. Option D talks about 'digging' to find food, which sounds like a method of hunt for food.\n8. Option E talks about a prayer to 'God' which is a type of prayer for something.\n9. Therefore from the context and what the problem is, it seems plausible that the answer would be B: hunt for something to EAT.\n10. There is a distinction to be made though between a hunt to hunt down food and a hunt to hud for something to eat.\n11. For example, a hunt for food like hunting a prey would imply killing the prey and is unlikely to yield something to eat, but a hud for something to EAT would be more applicable to find something edible to eat.\n12. However, in the given context, the problem is one of food scarcity and it is unlikely to refer to hunting down the prey, as it would not produce food items for people to eat.\n13. Hence, the only plausible option would be the option B: hunt for FOOD, which makes it the correct answer.\nSo the final option is B: hunt for SOMETHING to EAT\n\nInput: Your friend was in jail.

{"text": ": plant a garden D: start a farm E: invent food\nOutput: 1: The first thing that caught our attention in the options was the term \"invent food\". The question states that the neolithic person, presumably a hunter-gatherer, is hungry and needs food.\n2. The next thing we noticed was that the question asked us to choose the solution to the problem from the given options, as a multiple choice question.\n3. This leads us to ask, \"What was the solution they had?\"\n4. The options given are: A: Thank God B: Hunt for food C: Plant a garden D: Start a farm E: Invent food\n5. Based on the answer choices, we can infer that there were multiple solutions to this problem.\n6. Option A: Thanks God is not a solution, but a form of expression gratitude.\n7. Option B: Hunt for Food is a solution but it requires them to have access to food.\n8. Option C: Plant a Garden is a solution that also requires access to food, as well as the ability to grow gardens.\n9. Option D: Start a farm is also a solution that requires access to land and an initial seed.\n10. Option E: Invent Food is the most logical choice for a solution, as it implies that the answer will be something that the neolithics did not have access to before and that was invented.\n11. In conclusion, the most logical answer for the solution to the problem would be E: INVENT FOOD.\nSo the final choice is E : Invent food\n\nInput: Someone is feeling like a failure.

It doesn't represent the state of feeling like a failure.\n4) Option B: \"The failure\"  It refers directly to a specific situation or", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": ": go to work D: starve E: eat\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" is the name given to people from a specific time within history. We also know from the context that they encountered a difficult situation, as they were \"hungry.\"\n2. \"Solution\" refers to the choice that would allow this group of people to ease the predicament they are in.\n3. There is an assumption that it is the people not the whole society that is represented here. It makes sense as the society of the neolithic age had a much more developed approach to feeding the masses than that of individuals.\n4. The options A, D, E, give a solution. However, B, C, they do so under the assumption of a certain level of comfort that is not present in this scenario and was not present in the neolithic period.\n5. A: The solution 'thank God' is unlikely to be relevant or applicable to this context.\n6. B: Option B refers to 'hunt for food',  however, it does not specifically refer to a time-efficient method of finding food. The neolithic age did not have sophisticated tools or methods for finding food. Therefore, option B does not meet the requirements of the context.\n7. C: The possibility of 'going to work' is highly unrealistic because there was no widespread concept of employment in the neolithical era.\n8. E: The solution to the problem of hunger is referred to as 'eat'. It is the only choice that provides for the specific context of the problem.\n9. Therefore option E: 'eat' is the answer.\nSo the final choice is E: eat\n    \n  Input: Certain businesses get better than others, how? Choices:  (A) They are more expensive.

A: Thank God is not a suitable option as people during that time believed in superstitions.\n5. B: Hunt for food is the solution that seems to fit the context of the question. There was a shortage and people had to do what they could to solve the problem as they couldn't depend on rainfall.\n6. C: Barter is another solution that people resorted to when there were no other options available. For instance, they may have traded their services or goods for food. There could also have been trade routes in place during that era which ensured the availability of food.\n7. D: Pray for rain is not a suitable solution as such things weren't used during that time.\n8. E: Look for food is a logical solution which would be utilized during any situation of food shortage.\n9.

We can infer information from the question: Diana is a \"patient\" woman, she is encountering \"traffic,\" and her reaction is to remember her patience.\n2. Given that Diana is patient, we can assume that traffic is a source of frustration for her.\n3. However, because she is patient, recalling her patience helps her to deal with the frustration caused by traffic.\n4.

{"text": ": hunt for an animal for food D: kill an animal E: cook\nOutput: 1) First we consider the nature of neolithic people. They were hunter-gatherers who relied heavily on nature for sustenance and their existence was directly dependent on nature.\n2) Given this, it is unlikely that the neolithic period would have access to cooked food, which is mentioned as the solution.\n3) The options mentioned are: \"thanking\" or \"praying\" to gods, hunting for food, hunt for an animal specifically for food, and hunting an animal in general.\n4) The wording used is: \"problem\" but \"hunting\" doesn't seem like a problem, it's more of a solution.\n5) Option A - thanking or praying to god is out of context, especially as the neolithic people had yet to develop a religion.\n6) Option B - hunting for food was most likely a solution or a way of providing for themselves, therefore it doesn't seem like an option.\n7) option C - hunting for animal for food could be implied as a solution based on the context, but it only provides single-use food. So, it's not viable for long-term sustenance.\n8) The only suitable solution was D - hunting an animal for food in general and cooking to preserve the food and obtain necessary nutrients like protein.\n9) Therefore the answer is either Option D or E, but option D was more likely given the context.\nSo the final answers are either option D or E.\n\n\nInput: \"Avoid\", \"Avoidance\", and \"Avoided\" all contain what?

It involves neolithic people who are hungry, and who need to find a solution to the problem of being hungry.\n3. Neolithic people were hunter-gatherers, who would search for wild edible plants or animals as sources of food.\n4. The solutions the people would have made in such a situation would have been based on these findings.\n5. Looking at the options, we can infer what solutions would have made sense for them.\n6. Option A's solution would be applicable if the people were searching for food, but not necessarily if they were hungry and in search of food.\n7. Option B's solution would likely be irrelevant because it doesn't address the need to create food, but rather the need to obtain raw materials for creating clothing or shelter.\n8. Option C's solution could be applicable if the people encountered a wild animal while hunting, but not necessarily if the focus was on creating food to overcome their hunger.\n9. Option D's solution could also be applicable if the people located an area where they could construct a shelter, but not necessarily if it was necessary to immediately create food to satisfy their hunger.\n10. The remaining option, E's solution, seems the most appropriate for the scenario, as it speaks to creating clothes and shelter, which would be needed to address the people's immediate need for food.\n11.

Furthermore, thanking a deity is not a direct solution to hunger or food poverty.\nB: hunt for food - This option can be dismissed as being incompatible with the context in which food scarcity is a problem for neolithic people.\nC: plant vegetables - This answer was likely chosen by the author as \"plant vegetables\" implies working to produce one's own food source. However, based on the given information that the neolithics used cooking utensils and could produce enough food to sustain a large population, it can be concluded that they were not primarily food gatherer or hunter-gatherers, so planting vegetables would not be a viable solution to their hunger problem.\nD: store food - This is a possible solution that the prehistoric person may have had, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the question, and we cannot assume that it was always possible or commonly used.\nE: make their own fire - This is a viable option, as it would allow them to cook food, which would increase the nutritional value and provide warmth and light.\n2.

The true astronomical sunrise is also different from the cultural sunrise.\n3 In astronomy, the time of the astronomical sunrise corresponds to the moment of sunrise that occurs due to the apparent motion of the Sun in relation to the fixed Earth.\n4 Hence, it might be correct to say \"it's after sunrris and after dawn\".\n5 There is however no single time which can be determined as the moment at which the day begins, but there exists an agreed time at which the day typically ends.

However, if 'good plot' is combined with 'old,' then it can be inferred that the book may cost more because it is an older edition. \n4- 'Fewer' can be considered as a plausible reason for why the book is expensive since the number of copies available could be limited, thereby driving up the price. \n5- Thus, option E: 'few' is the correct answer since it can explain why the book is more expensive.\nSo the final is E: few\n\nInput: I am not very good at making a good presentation.

Neolithic refers to a period in an era, which was a time when Homo sapiens made the transition from hunting and gathering to farming for food.\n3. This means the question is centred on a hunter-gatherer from the Neolithic age.\n4. Looking to the options provided, the answer depends on various factors such as availability of food and other resources.\n5. Option \u201cA: thank god\u201d would not be appropriate as it suggests a lack of action or a reluctance to take charge.\n6. Option \u201cB: hunt for food\u201d is likely as meat would be hunted as a food source, since hunting would be the preferred method for food.\n7. Given the context and time period, Homo sapiens may not have had a high level of technology to hunt effectively.\n8. Therefore, a logical answer would be option \u201cC: find meat\u201d.\n9. Option \u201cD: search for a rabbits\u201d is a possible answer as rabbits were hunted for food during the Stone Age, a period between the Paleolithic and Neolithic eras.\n10. Option \u201cE: eat berries\u201d is excluded as this would be a temporary solution, or perhaps not even an option given the time period.\n11.

However, there is no time element or limitation to the choice given.  Moreover, the option is vague and could mean anything from \"gathering\" herbs to \"gathering\" wild game.\n7) Therefore, we can exclude this option as well.\n8) Finally, \"pray\" is an extremely common answer to almost any existential issue and does not lend itself to the logical inference of the context.\n9) This leaves us with \"go to the market\", which satisfies the requirements of the context presented.

A: thank god - This option does not state what the neolithic hungry person did to resolve being hungry. We can conclude, however, that this option is not the solution to the question being asked and rule it out.\nB: A: go on a hunt for food - This option states 'hunt for food' but does not specify what the neolithal person did to resolve their hunger. It is logical, however, to assume that a hunt would not take place if the person was already too hungry to do so. For this reason, this option is also not a valid answer choice.\nC: C: eat leaves and Weeds - This option states that the neolithic hunter would have eaten leaves and weeds. Based on the context, it is logical to assume that the person in question could not have been able to sustain themselves for an extended period of time if their primary food source was leaves and weeds, and that they would only have eaten these in the short term. For this reason, the option C is also disqualified.\nD: D: catch fish - This option states 'catch fish.' Based on the context, a neolithic person could not have caught enough fish to sustain their hunger for an extended period of, however, one could assume they could have caught enough to do so temporarily. For this reason, E, 'catch fish' is also likely to be the person's solution to the problem.\nE: E: pick nuts berries and fruits - This option states 'pick nuts, berries and fruits'. The context indicates that the neolithc hunts could not have been able sustain themselves permanently through these sources which would only be appropriate in the medium term. For this reason 'catch fish' is more likely a long term solution than picking nuts, berries or fruits.\n3: Therefore, the answer for this question is D: catch fish.\nSo the final and correct answer should be D: catch fish\n\nInput: The cure for malaria was discovered based on what evidence?

In a previous sentence, the question describes a neolithic person who was facing starvation as everything they cooked had burnt in their kitchen fire. \n3.) The options which are offered represent solutions to this problem.\n4.) To find a specific solution, we need to consider each one. As \"Thank God\" does not refer to the problem of cooking, this can be eliminated as an option.\n5.) Likewise, \"hunt for food\" does not refer to finding cooking supplies, making that solution impossible.\n6.) \"go to a bistro\" does not refer to food specifically, but it could be a solution that the neolithic person could take to prevent the problem of starvation.\n7.) Likewise, \"go camping\" does not refer directly to the same problem, but this might be a relevant solution if the fire burns off due to a lack of fuel. As the options seem to revolve around the lack of fuel in the fireplace, we can eliminate option D and E.\n8.) Similarly, \"plant flowers\" does not seem to refer specifically to solving the problem of cooking and food scarcity.\n9.) Therefore, the only left choice seems to be C: hunt for food. \n10.)

Choices: 1: move downwards 2: move upwards 3: move to a new plate 4: not move\nOutput: 1: If the worm is on top of a plate, then it will move downwards. A worm, being a creature that normally lives on the ground, will not be at the top of a plate. 2: A worm is not capable of moving upwards, as it would be unable to navigate or perceive changes in its immediate environment.\n3: A worm is also not capable of moving to another plate, as it is dependent on the ground for support and mobility.\n4: A worm will not move. \nSo the final answer: 1: move  downwards\n\nInput: It was dark and no one was walking near the dog, so he went near the trash can and grabbed the what?

The context of the situation suggests that the people faced food shortages frequently, given their limited access to resources and lack of advanced technology.\n2. Options A and E can be eliminated right away, as they are out of scope or irrelevant.\n3. Looking at option D \"pray\", it seems like a spiritual response to the problem, which wouldn't be expected from the Neolithic era, as they didn't necessarily have the concept of prayer or a deity to pray to.\n4. Option B \"hunt for food\", suggests an alternative solution to the problem, however, by definition it's unlikely the Neolithic person would have time to do this given the frequency of food shortages.\n5. Therefore we're left with choice C \"work the land\". This would indicate the Neolithic man made significant improvements to his access to food by working with the growing of crops.\n6.

This implies that the neolotihc person was placing their faith in a higher power for assistance rather than taking immediate action through hunting, searching, or constructing.\n8) Based on these clues, it is likely that the neoloths chose to go foraging, as it is an active form of hunting and searching for food that aligns with the description of the neolothic people being hungry and in need of a solution to their hunger.\n9) In conclusion, based on the provided clues, option D \"to forage\" appears to be the most likely response.\nSo the final  answer is D: to Forage\n\n## How to Run Code:\n\n1) Run code from command line as follows:\n\n```python\npython graded_code.py\n```\n\n2) Copy the entire output from above.\n\n3) Upload the file in this question as question_data.csv into Gradescope. \n\n4) Once uploaded in GradeScope, save the file as a question and submit the question for grading.", "answer": " 24"}

Therefore, based on this, we can determine that the most appropriate answer would be option E: grow food and watch. The neoliths had to find a way to produce food, but lacked agriculture. They had to grow food and watch over the growing plants to ensure they survive. \n4-5:\n4. We need to break it down further to narrow down on specific possible answers. Options A to D do not fit in with this part of the question.\n5. The question is talking about agriculture as a solution to the problem of the neolithic people being hungry and needing a solution. \n6-7:\n6. Thus, the answer becomes E: grow food and watching it. \nSo the final answer would be E: grow food and wait.\n\nInput: A tiger has fur, what does a human have? Choices: 1.

{"text": ": forage for food D: make tools E: pray\nOutput: 1) After understanding the context of the question, the key information we can glean is that in response to his hunger, the neolithic person acted to forage for food.\n2) From the given options we can infer which of the given options will fit context of the question.\n3) 'Pray' is out of context and is a word that does not fit into the situation of a hungry neolithic person.\n4) 'Thank God' is a phrase that is used when one is thankful and should be used in the right context. \n5) 'Hunt' is an activity that involves procuring food, but only specifies killing food sources, which may lead to starvation. (E.g. a hunter may fail to successfully hunt for food).\n6) Tools are used to hunt or to forage for food, so this is a valid choice.\n7) 'Forage' is a term related to looking for food sources and is suitable for such a context.\n8) Therefore, from the given options, the answer is E.\nSo the final answe is E: forage\n\nInput: Sita and her mother are discussing which of the two places in their family tree would be best for them to live.

{"text": ": get rid of it D: kill it E: prepare\nOutput: 1: From the given sentence, it becomes clear that the answer choice would represent the neolithic person's choice (ie. their solution). It should not be taken as the creator of the problem.\n2. The first clue to the answer lies in the sentence: \"The neolithic person.....\" It indicates that the speaker is referring to a Neolithic period as the period where the neolithic problem arose.\n3. The problem identified by the creator is not explicitly mentioned, however, context can provide further information.\n4. The rest of the sentence indicates that the neolithic society has a solution which is based on their need.\n5. Choice A: \"thank god\" is the solution when one is not in a position to solve the problem themselves. The speaker is likely referring to the gods and not the neolithic people, as the solution is theirs, and based on the context is likely what the neolithic would seek to do.\n6. Choice B: \"Hunt for food\" is an action associated with the neolithic era.\n7. Choice C: \"Get rid of\" is an action that people sometimes resort to when seeking a solution.\n8. Choice D: \"Kill it/them\" could be a solution to the problem of hunger. However, based on the context, it is unlikely that this would also be the chosen solution of the Neolithic person.\n9. Choice E: \"Prepare food\" is the answer based on evidence and context provided.\n10. Therefore, by elimination, the answer is E - prepare food.\nSo the final solution is E - prepare food\n\nInput: The most important thing is that you can write the song you're writing right now.

{"text": ": learn to garden D: find meat E: find wood\nOutput: 1) By analyzing the question, it's clear we need to find a specific answer for a food-related issue facing neolithic people.\n2) The key clues we have are: \"hungry\" and \"find food\".\n3) Looking at the options: A and B are general/generalized options where we don't know exactly what the neolithic person would have done or is referring to.\n4) \"Thank god\" is a general reaction to any issue, which means it's probably not relevant to the context of the problem at hand.\n5) D is similar to C, but the distinction is that we're not sure if the neolithic people could \"garden\" at the time, so this option is also not clear. It'd have to be supported by additional info.\n6) The only option that makes sense in the context is E: \"find meat\", as we already know the neolithic individuals would have hunted for foods and also hunted for meat in particular.\n7) Therefore, the answer is most likely to be E: Find Meat.\nSo the final answers is E: Find Meat\n\nInput: After a long life, Mr. Brown finally achieved what he desired. His goal from youth was what? Choices: A: success B: money C: friends D: to be the best E: to help others\nOutput: 1: The question mentions Mr. Brown's long life and the time he spent pursuing his goal, indicating that Mr. Brown achieved his objective.\n2. The goal refers to what he long desired, which means it refers to a long-term aspiration or pursuit rather than something he desired for a single day.\n3. He desired to be the best or help others. Given the context, option D is the correct answer, as it implies a long-term goal towards being the best or helping others.\n4. Option E is not mentioned anywhere in the question, nor does it make sense to be included given the context.\n5. Options A and B do not make sense because they aren't specifically related to what he had long desired and haven't been mentioned anywhere else in the context.\n6. Therefore, the answer will be D: to be the Best or to help others.\nSo the final", "answer": " 7"}

Option D: a willingness to put the needs of the team before their own needs, and Option E to work cooperatively to achieve a common goal.\nOutput: 1.'The desire to win' is too general an answer and doesn't necessarily apply to both individuals. It doesn't account for those who may be more balanced in their approach to success.\n2. 'A willingness to put the team's interests before their own interests' is very much a team player quality, but it is not specific to winning.\n3. In addition, this option doesn't necessarily contribute to a team' success, which is what the question is concerned with.\n4. Option D: 'A desire to win' is related to team success, but by no means is it exclusive. It's a necessary, but not sufficient quality for a team player.\n5.

{"text": ": be prepared D: learn to fish E: grow crops\nOutput: 1) The question refers to Neolithic people and their struggle to acquire food.\n2. Based on the context of food acquisition, \"growing crops\" would be the most likely option. \n3. Growing crops would have been the most viable and long-lasting solution for the Neolithic period.\n4. It allowed people to produce crops with high yield and was sustainable for a long time.\n5. \"Hunt for food\" and \"be prepared\" are short-term and ineffective solutions for long-term sustainability, and thus, the given options do not fit the context of the question.\n6. \"Learn to fish\" and \"thank god\" are not related to this question and can be excluded.\n\nTherefore, in summary, the answer is: D: learn to fish\n\nInput: For a small town, there is a very long line to get a ticket to what? Choices A: concert B: dance C: sports D: theatre E: amusement park\nOutput: 1.) According to the question, the town is of small size, and the line is long enough to indicate the existence of a busy and crowded event.\n2.) The options all refer to various forms of entertainment and recreation. \n3.) Among these, \"concerts\" and \"theatres\" are not necessarily long queues. \n4.) \"Sports\" events are usually held indoors, which is not in line with the outdoor nature of the queue.\n5.) The mention of \"tickets\" and \"seats\" implies a certain level of organization and formal structure, more associated with \"theatres\" than \"concerts.\"\n6.) Lastly, \"amusement parks\" are not necessarily busy, long-lasting places, so the answer is E: \"amusement park.\"\nSo the final answer  is E: amusement park", "answer": " 138"}

{"text": ": pick fruit D: pray E: grow a garden\nOutput: 1.) Neolithic man's solution to the problem of hunger would likely be one that's based on practicality and necessity, rather than one that involves gratitude or religious beliefs.\n2.) The question provides clues about the Neolithic man, including his/her location and circumstances.\n3.) Based on the clues provided, we can infer the most likely solution that a Neolithic man would take to the problem of hungers.\n4.) Taking into account the clues provided and applying deductive reasoning, we can infer that the most likely solution a neolithic person would take to the problem is option B: hunt for some food. \n5.) Option A: thank god, is not a practical or logical solution, given the circumstances.\n6.) Option C: pick fruit, may be a logical solution to solve the problem of hunger for a while, it's not an enduring one.\n7.) Option D: pray, is a religious solution, which is not necessarily dependent on practicality and/or common sense.\n8.) Therefore, from the options of choice, the most likely solution for a neolithic man to take to the problem of hunge is option B: hunter foods.\nSo the final answers is B: hunter food\n\nInput: A new study looks at the brain when people read for pleasure.

Thus, the study would likely be evaluating the brain activity of people engrossed in reading a book for leasure purposes.\n3) The right hemisphere of the brain is associated with various functions, including creativity, empathy, and interpretation of images, while the left hemisphere of the brains is linked to logical thinking and verbal skills.\n4) Therefore, studying the brain activity in people who are reading a book for lease would likely focus more on the right hemisphere, as the process of reading and absorbing the content would be more related to the right hemisphere functions.\n5) As for the answer, we can conclude that option B", "answer": " 37"}
{"text": ": take the first available D: thank the gods E: pray before hunting\nOutput: 1 First, we need to clarify the question. The question is asking about what the neolithic person did to solve the problem of being hungry. \n2. From the options provided, we know that the neolithic period was a time before the advent of agriculture and widespread use of modern implements, tools, and farming techniques, and that the neolithics were hunters and gatherers. Based on these facts, the options given are A 'Thank God' and E 'Pray before Hunting'.\n3. Option A, as the others, refers to hunting or gathering food. This is not a solution to the problem, but rather a continuation of the search for a solution to the problem. It could be argued that Option D 'thank gods' is a solution to the problem since it would help bring in divine intervention and ensure a good harvest for the neolithic and provide sustenance.\n4. But the problem is of being hungry or starving, so option D does not directly solve the problem, but may lead to a solution (i.e. by seeking help from the divine).\n5. Option E, which says 'pray before hunting', is a viable solution to the problem of hunger. Praying for divine intervention before hunting could ensure that the neolithical people would have a better chance of finding food and avoiding hunger.\n6. Therefore, from the given options, the correct answer is option E: pray before hunting.\nSo the final correct answer is E: pray before hunting", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": ": kill lion D: kill deer E: starve\nOutput: 1: The question refers to a hungry neolithic person and the options refer to their solution for the problem.\n2. The options suggest different choices that the person can make to find food or solve the problem of hunger.\n3. Option A: 'Thank God' refers to praying to god and seeking his help to find food, which is not really an option.\n4. Option B: 'Hunt for food' also refers to the person looking for food by hunting for it.\n5. Option C: 'Killing the lion' doesn't seem like a realistic action to solve the food problem.\n6. Option D: 'Killing the deer' also doesn't seem to be a realistic choice to solve the food problem\n7. Option E: 'Starving' is actually a correct choice for what the neolithic person might do in case of hunger because it's the most basic and likely solution to the problem.\n8. Therefore, from this line of reasoning, the answer is D\n9. Therefore, based on our conclusions, the answer is D = Starving\nSo the final answer should be D: starving\n\nInput: How many children did the couple have, on average, every two years? Choices: 1. 8 A 3 B 4 C 5 D 6\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about how many children the couple would have every two years on average.\n2) When asked about the number of children per couple, the word 'on average' could suggest we need to provide the average value of the number of children per year.\n3) However, as the word 'every' refers to two years, we infer that we need to provide the answer in terms of number children the couple will have every two years or two years on average which will give us an average number of children with a frequency of two years.\n4) Looking at the options the first four options are values in the year range and not every two years and the last option for two years is ambiguous in term of the frequency.\n5) Therefore, the correct answer is C: 4\nSo, the final answer is C = 4\n\nInput: The world can be a wonderful place with people who can find it in their hearts to help others.

{"text": ": share food D: look at the sky E: ponder on food sources\nOutput: 1) The first thing we should know when looking at the options is that the context does not allow us to use an exact answer word/phrase to form the rest of the answer.\n2) From the context, we get \"the solution to the problem\". Problem: Hungry Person is what we should look to when going for the answer.\n3) Looking at the choices B, C and E, we can quickly understand that these options are not relevant for this question.\n4) As for the choice options B and C, we will understand them in context: Hunt for food is to kill something, whereas the share food option does not take into consideration the \"hungry\" context.\n5) The answer in context needs to be the cause of a food solution for the hungry person. Now, looking at the sky option, we can see that the action of \"pondering\" cannot be said to directly cause a food source for a hungry person - just pondering without action. \n6) The same is true to looking at the option sky, which leaves us with A+D: Thank God, Food Solution and Ponder over food options.\n7) We can choose between these two options, and the correct option is A+D= Thank God, Food Solution.\nSo the final contextual answer is A+D: Thank god, food source\n\nInput: It's important to remember that the past does not necessarily predict what will happen in the future.

The only option which makes sense is option B: Hunt for food. There is no other option which could be considered a good solution.\n3. The hungry Neolithic person would, at a base level, simply hunt for food. If the answer was not Hunting for Food, it could be inferred that the wording in the question would be too ambiguous to be considered accurate.\n4. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: hunting for food. \nSo the final answer  is B: hunt for Food\n\nInput: I have to explain a term to someone in the workplace.  I chose the term \"fiscal what\" because it was less obscure than \"capital what.\" Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: 1.) \"I have to explain a term for someone in the workplace\" => This means you're trying to explain something in a financial setting.\n2.) \"I chose the term 'fiscal what' because it was less obscur\" => The word Obscure means ambiguous. You don't want to talk to someone who doesn't understand the term and have to explain something. What you actually want is a clear and concise word.\n3.) \"Capital what\" is a finance term but obscure because people may not understand it.\n4.) \"Fiscal what\" is a less obscure term. Not only does it not need to be explained as much, it is less obcsure for finance because people will understand it.\n5.)

{"text": ": invent tools D: go back to the stone age E: go and kill a wooly mammoth\nOutput: 1) The question centers around the neolithic person who is faced with a problem of being hungry.\n2) Based on the context, it can be inferred that the neolithic society was not advanced in technology and hence was not able to solve various problems using modern technologies such as hunting and tools.\n3) So, options A and B can be ruled out as they do not apply to the situation of the neolithic hungry person.\n4) Option C 'invent tools' seems relevant, but this is a hypothetical and can't be used to solve the problem of hunger.\n5) Option D 'go back to the stone age' can be considered as this relates to a lack of technological advancement, but it is not directly connected to solving a problem of hunger. Moreover, we are given that the neolithics lived in modern stone-age technology, i.e. the stone age was already passed over, and they had not 'gone back'.\n6) What neolithics did during hunger was to invent a fire because of which they were able to cook, and eat cooked food, which made their lives easier and food palatable.\n7) Looking at the options again, option E seems the most relevant, and hence is the answer.\nSo the final result is E: go and kill the wooly mammouth\n\nInput: What is the name of the 25th letter of the Greek alphabet as represented by the following sequence of characters?

This may seem like a viable solution to the hunger, but it's inaccurate in the context of the sentence.\nOption D: This is a viable solution and would be a logical choice for a person who was hungry; however, we can assume that it wasn't the choice made in the context of the statement.\nOption E: The microwave was not invented until 1940 by Percy Spencer; therefore, it is an inaccurate solution to the statement's context, so this is a wrong option.\nOption C: This is a viably accurate choice that a hungry person would undertake.\n3: Therefore, the correct answer would be C: eating a plant or food.\nSo the final answers is C: eat plant\n\nInput: There are two types of people working at the hospital.

It's important to pay attention to who is being referred to as there are several options.\n2- Doctors and Lab Workers are not the same as the context given in the statement's example, so we can eliminate that option.\n3- Nurses are not necessarily health workers, and they are not in a leadership role as the director of an organization.\nOption C: There are some specialized health workers who are considered specialists, such as a dentist or physician. These specialists are typically not working in the position of director, so this option does not meet the requirement.\n4- The only option that meets the context of this statement and the requirement is E: Specialists.", "answer": " 11"}
{"text": ": make fire D: make a fire E: make fire\nOutput: 1) By 'The neolithic person' in options A, B, C, D, E, we are referring to a group of people who lived during the late Stone Age roughly between 10,000 BCE - 4,500 BCE where they used stone and other materials to produce tools and other objects. During this time period, they were dependent on hunting and foraging for their food needs.\n2) Based on the context, the hunter-gatherers of the Stone Age likely faced issues of food scarcity due to climate change and the depletion of natural resources.\n3) In order to cope with food shortages, the neolithic person might have had recourse to praying for it or using hunting as a solution to their problem.\n4) However, these options are not specific to the neolithic people, and may be applicable to other civilizations in different parts of the world.\n\n5) Given the context, the most likely answer to this question is'make a fire' as it was one of the most significant innovations of the neolithic era. Fire provided heat and cooked food, making it a valuable resource that the Stone Age people used to obtain food, stay warm, and ward off predators. Additionally, fire was used to produce tools, light, and was a significant part of their communal rituals.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is E: make fire.\nSo the final Answer is E: make fire\n\nInput: If a person is in a position due to a connection or position of influence then what does people call that?

{"text": ": eat the last of the animals meat D: farm a plant for food E: discover agriculture\nOutput: 1) First, we need to determine whether the neolithic person can be replaced with any other person or group of people. \n2) If we refer to the term \"neolithic person\" as being specifically an individual from the Stone Age, the answer would be D: farm a plant.\n3) Neolithic people were hunter-gatherers during the Stone Age, which meant they ate meat from the animals they hunted and vegetables gathered from plants.\n4) Farming (Option D), was the method used by ancient civilizations to cultivate and harvest food crops, such as wheat, barley, and olives. \n5) Thus, one solution to the problem for hunters-gatherers in the Stone Age would be to farm plants as a means of gathering and growing their own crops.\n6) Another solution to the problem would be to utilize another resource for food, such as meat from hunting animals or vegetables gathered from plants (Option B & C).\n7) However, it is not clear from the context whether the meat would be eaten raw or cooked, which would influence the outcome of the situation.\n8) Additionally, hunting alone is not a sufficient means of obtaining sufficient quantities of meat to feed a large population.\n9) Therefore, as a viable solution for food production and sustenance, farming would be a more practical alternative.\n10) Hence, the answer would be Option D: farm a plant, which meets the requirement of being a viable solution to the problem.\nSo the final A: farm a plant Choices: neolithic person, thank god, hunt for food, eat the last of the animal's meat, farm a plant, discover agriculture\n\n# Trivandrum Math Olympiad - AI\n\n# Solution from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trivandrum-math-olympiad-solutions/\n# Time Constraints - 2 Minutes / Question\n\n# Input:\n# Input: A rectangular box of width 35 inches and height 33 inches has an empty space left on two sides.

{"text": ": eat from garbage D: make soup E: gather vegetables\nOutput: 1\"1. The neolithic period is defined as a time of transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture and domestication of animals.\n2. The question implies that humans during this period were hunter-gatherers before making the transition to farming, as they were said to be hungry and needed to find a solution to the problem of hunger.\n3. The options provided seem to describe the solutions that humans could have found to feed themselves in order to avoid hunger.\n4. As the choices given describe food-related options, we can eliminate A & B, since they don't fit the description.\n5. Option C \"making soup\" can describe how food is served in such a way as to make it easier to feed oneself, but it doesn'y necessarily address the problem of being hungry.\n6. Option D \"eat from garbage\" addresses the issue of hunger by providing food that may be available, but it probably doesn't address the food source as a whole or provide additional solution to ensure food security. \n7. Option E \"gather vegetables\" also doesn't seem likely to address the issue of hunger. \n8. Therefore, the answer to the question seems likely to be an option that solves all the issues related to hunger and food security in the context of the hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\n9. Among the given choices, \"Gathering vegetables\" aligns with the context of the question as vegetables could've provided an additional source of food to address the issue of being hungry. \n10. In addition, the gathering of vegetables also could've provided a way to store food to eliminate hunger.\n11. This means gathering vegetables is the answer to the question. So, the final answer is E.\nSo the final answers are E: gather vegetables.\n\nInput: His last name is Jones but he goes by Dasher.  How common is that name? Choices: .

{"text": ": ask to share D: grow plants E: find a farmer\nOutput: 1) The question deals with a neolithic person who is hungry and looking for a solution to their food problem.\n2) The neolithic period is a prehistoric era before the agricultural revolution. Therefore, the choices provided in the question, namely the options that involve agriculture and farming, are unlikely to be applicable to this time period. The remaining options deal with hunting or the search for food, which is the likely solution for a person in this era.\n3) In this context, option C seems like an appropriate choice, as asking for help in hunting or finding food would likely involve asking someone to share their food with you, rather than growing plants.\n4) Option A is also a plausible choice, given the existence of belief in a higher power during prehistoric times. However, the neolithic person's primary concern in this scenario is food, rather than thanking a higher power for help.\nSo the final choice is C: ask to share.", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": ": fish D: farm E: find other food sources\nOutput: 1) The question provides us with the scenario of a neolithic person being hungry. The neolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools and the practice of agriculture.\n2) Based on this information, we can infer that the neolithic person did not have access to modern technology or the ease of availability of food that people in our society have.\n3) Therefore, based on our known and inferred information, the neolithic people had to actively search for food, and their solution to addressing hunger was 'hunting for food'.\n4) The given options, A through E, may be solutions to hunger, but they are not specific to the neolithic era.\n5) The given solutions are more recent advancements that we have access to, and the neolithic period does not reflect these advancements, which is why the given options are irrelevant to this problem.\n6) Therefore, the solution for the neolithic man was that he would have 'hunted for food', making Option B: hunt for Food, the most appropriate choice.\nSo the final solution is B: hunt for fish", "answer": " 1210"}
{"text": ": grow plants D: bake food E: find fruits\nOutput: 1.\u201dThe neolithic person\u201d is a generic term used to refer to ancient humans or the period in which they lived. \n2. Homo sapiens, often referred to as modern humans, lived in the neolithic period and are considered the ancestors of today's populations.\n3. One of the defining characteristics of the neolithic era was the invention of agriculture and its associated technologies, including farming, irrigation, and seed storage.\n4. The question posits that the neolithic person is hungry.\n5. The options provided are vague and don't specify whether the neolithic \"person\" would be single or in a group.\n6. If we consider a single neolithic hunter-gatherer who is in the midst of a period of drought and needs to find food, the simplest solution would be to grow plants. \n7. To grow sufficient quantities of plants, the individual would need to have the necessary skills and knowledge to farm and care for the soil as well as the plants.\n8. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer may be B: grow plants or plants in bulk. \nSo the final answer would be B: grow plants.", "answer": " 57"}
{"text": ": collect nuts D: buy more E: eat less\nOutput: The question gives context for the neolithic person to be hungry in the absence of other options.\nOption A:  hungry does not imply starvation. If there is no starvation, then other option can be selected.\nOption B:  This option is not the correct answer because it specifies that the food is hunted. Since, the neolithic people did not know of hunting.\nOption C: No explanation is mentioned for why they are collecting. Moreover, the options A, B and D can explain why they are collecting nuts.\nOption D:  The neolithic people were not smart enough to buy food as there were no shops available.\nOption E:  They can eat fewer nuts, because the option A, does not specify that they are starving.\n\nAnswer Choice D is the best.\nSo the final solution is E: eat less.\n\nInput: There is no time like the present for what? Choices: A: procrastinating B: learning new things C: taking more risks D: avoiding unnecessary obligations E: making the most of opportunities that arise\nOutput: The question provides context for the present where an opportunity presents itself to be made the most of. However, there are several obstacles that can be avoided to seize this opportunity.\nOptions A, B, C, D and E are all viable choices for the present which could allow one to make the most of an opportunity while avoiding obstacles.\nFrom the context of the question and options provided, option E: Making the most of opportunities.\nSo the present time allows for making the most of an opportunity, while avoiding obstacles in the process.\n\nInput: The question in the sentence is not complete without which of the following?

{"text": ": pray D: find it themselves E: thank god again\nOutput: 1) The question tells us that the neolithic person is hungry and asks us to choose the solution they came up with to deal with the situation.\n2) Hunting for food and praying are both solutions that may be considered by a hungry person, but praying may not necessarily be their solution.\n3) Finding food for themselves is also a possibility and is the opposite of hiring someone to do it for them, which leaves as the only viable option in this context.\nSo the final choice is B: hunt for themselves", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": ": eat D: pray E: invent food\nOutput: 1) Looking at the context, we can deduce the following: The person was \u201cneolithic\u201d, so they lived during the Neolithic Revolution, a time period characterized by the development and spread of agriculture and settlements.\n2) In this time period, food was largely obtained through hunting and gathering, as agriculture had yet to become widespread.\n3) Therefore, our options are (D) (Pray), (E) (Invent food) are excluded, as they are not likely solutions for a neolithic person who did not have access to modern technology.\n4) (B) (Hunt for food) is also excluded, as it would not have been a quick solution to the person's hunger, and is only relevant for the person if they had adequate resources and skills to conduct a successful hunt.\n5) Looking at the remaining options, we can exclude (A) (Thank God) simply due to the context; the person was unable to obtain food through prayer, and was not yet aware of the concept of a god, making the option irrelevant in the context of the prompt.\n6) Therefore, the only remaining option is (C) (Eat) as a neolithic people who had limited resources and access to food would likely have resorted to eating whatever food they could find, including those they could forage, trap, or hunt.\nSo the final options is C: eat\n\nInput: A good example of a misrepresentation is when something is presented incorrectly in an attempt to influence your thoughts.

{"text": ": gather berries D: invent fishing rod E: invent the wheel\nOutput: 1: The first clue is that the Neolithic person was \"hungry\". This is a vague description that could mean simply that they were \"without food\" or that they had an empty stomach.\n2: The next clue is that the Neo-lithic person was \"solution to the problem\". This states that their situation was the kind that required a solution. \n3. Looking at the given options, it seems that the most likely way to describe a solution to a problem would be by inventing something. \n4. Based on this, the option that makes the most sense is \"invent the wheel\". This option conveys that the Neo-litic person has solved their problem by inventing a tool that enables them to access food. It is an accurate description and makes a logical progression from what we know about the situation.\n5.

{"text": ": grow food D: take a nap E: pray\nOutput: 1) Understanding the problem statement: The neolithis person was hungry and looking for a solution to their hunger.\n2) Given the problem, let's look at the options provided:\na. Option A: thank God - This doesn't seem to be a direct solution to the problem of hunger.\nb. Option B: Hunt for food - This can be a solution to the problem of finding food, but not necessarily a solution to the broader problem of hunger. Hundreds of hunters in the neolithic era hunted animals, yet they were still hungry. Additionally, this option doesn't address the specific solution that the neolithic person in the question was seeking.\nc. Option C: grow food - This could potentially be a solution to the neolithic problem of hunger; however, this could also refer to food animals rather than food.\nd. Option D: take a nap - This option does not refer to finding food directly, but it could be a solution that helps increase one's energy and focus so they can locate food, which might be effective if the hunger was not a result of food scarcity.\n3) Therefore, the most likely answer is Option E: pray - Prayer could be considered a solution to the problem described. Since the neolithic people are experiencing a lack of food, prayer could be a form of supplication for divine intervention and could be considered a solution.\nSo the final ans is E: Pray\n\nInput: Sam needs to solve a math problem.

{"text": ": go home D: pray E: find a cave\nOutput: 1) The neolithic people had hungry because they had been away from home for a long time. So, they had to find a solution to their problem.\n2) From the given options, some are solutions that would have been considered by a modern person, while others are more likely to be rooted in Neolithic culture or values.\n3) 'Thank god' - is the type of solution that most people might not have considered in that culture at that time. 'Hunting for food' & 'Praying' - are more likely to be solutions that the Neolithic people would have considered.\n4) Going home seems like another solution that the Neolith people might have considered.\n5) Finding a cave seems to be a bit of a leap, as it's unknown if Neolithic people had caves at that time or thought about caves as a solution.\n6) 'Thanks God' - is an unlikely solution as it relates to a religious belief that probably would not have existed at that time/culture. This is a modern concept, so it cannot be the correct answer\n7) 'Hunting for Food' - would be another unlikely solution, as it relates to modern hunting practices, which would have been uncommon at that time.\n8) 'Going Home' - would a reasonable answer, as it would have been a way to find food, shelter, and resources. It would also have provided a sense of safety and comfort during difficult times.\n9) 'Praying' Praying could have been an option for the Neolithic person to use as a solution, but this would have been a spiritual practice and not necessarily rooted in a solution to their immediate problem.\n10) 'Finding a cave' - could have been a natural or existing solution, but it also doesn't directly address the problem of being hungry. It's possible that the neolithic person might not have considered a cave as a solution to their problem, but rather viewed it as a place of safety or refuge.\n11) Therefore, the answer is C) 'Praying\"\nSo the final answer would be: C) 'Prayer\n\nInput: How are human beings different from computers?

Hunt for food would not have been a solution as that technology was not there yet.\n3. This means the Neolithic person would have just eaten rocks.\n4. This is extremely unlikely as rocks and food were not on the same menu and would not help the problem of hunger.\n5. This would leave us with the remaining choices as D) create Pottery and E) gather moss.\n6. If we look at the choices we will find that rocks cannot be gathered at all.\n7. This also eliminates choice E as they were not able to gather the moss due to their hands being raw from handling raw dirt.\n8. Next we have the choice of creating Pottery.\n9.

Tone has been mentioned as a quality of speech in certain languages, we can infer from the fact that tonal means that the language has pitch.\nSince pitch changes in the tone of speech, we can infer that tone refers to pitch.\n3.) But, what about volume and speed?\n\n4.) Speed is often included as an option, but it has nothing to do with speech quality or pitch and is also not present in all languages that are tonal.\n\n5.) Volume changes with tone quality, and is usually specified with reference to pitch or pitch changes.\n\nTONAL SPEED\nSpeed is a factor of volume and pitch which means the speed cannot be directly related to tone.\n6.)

{"text": ": gather fruits & vegetables D: build a tree B: farm food E: eat some bread & butter\nOutput: 1) Context: The question specifically asks about the solution adopted to solve the hunger problem by a \"neolithic person.\"\n2. Neolithic refers to an historical era. \n3. The neolithic period was a period marked by the agricultural revolution, in which plant cultivation and animal domestication enabled food production on a wider scale.\n4. Therefore, from the context, it' s likely that the neolithic person would've adopted a solution associated with farming and food production.\n5. Based on the context, we can make the following deductions from the given options - 'thank god' is not a solution that addresses the hunger problem; 'hunting for food' could be a solution, but it's probably not the only solution as the person was described as being hungry and there not just a single solution to their problem; 'gathering fruits and vegetables' could also be a possible solution, but this involves collecting existing products from nature, which doesn't necessarily address the production of food; 'plant cultivation' and 'animal domestication' both directly address the production of food and could be potential solutions.\n6. Therefore, considering the context, the most suitable answer choice is E: \"eat some bread and butter.\" \nSo the final answer  is E: eat some bread and butter\n\nInput: As the sun rises, the __________ fills the sky.

Option A: This is not a viable option as it does not solve the problem of being hungry. God cannot provide us food, nor is it physically possible for people to 'thank' them. Hence, option A can be eliminated.\n4. Option B: Hunting for food was a solution commonly used by hunters during this time period. The term 'hunt' includes a wide variety of methods, including using traps, animals, hunting dogs, and other means of obtaining food.\n5. This means option B should be a viable choice since it was a common solution by people during the Neolithic period.\n6. Option D: This is the only option that describes an activity where ingredients could be obtained.  Thus, we can eliminate option C since hunting may also include using tools, which doesn't help solve the problem of hunger.\n7. Although we have eliminated one option, we still need to consider if option D is sufficient.\n8. Option E: Growing one's own food would depend on whether or not there was enough land available to grow the food and whether or not the plants could be grown on that land effectively enough to satisfy famine-like conditions.\n9. So, if the land was available, the person would not have to go through the process of hunting or searching for their food, and they could instead rely on their own farm or garden to be able to provide sustenance.\n10.

In fact, one of their traditional practices was keeping animals for their milk and meat and not for human consumption.\n7. Option A: thank god does not make sense in the context of the question.\n8. Option B: hunt for a food is not likely to be a solution to hunger.\n9. Option C: eat animal would not be relevant as we know that the neolithic culture was not fond of eating them.\n10. Option E: raise animal is not probable as they were used to keep animals for their milk and not for human consumption\n11. Therefore option D: Raise vegetable seems like a plausible solution to the hunger problem.\n12. Therefore, the answer to the question of the food choices of the neolithic person is D: Raise vegetables\nSo the final answer if D: raise vegetable\n\nInput: The king needs to get the queen a gift for her birthdqy.  what will he buy her?

It's likely that their speed would drop off after a short while of chasing the dog.\n5: The choice 'he/she needs more speed' is vague, suggesting further details are needed to understand what is meant by'speed'.\n6: Therefore, the answer has to be the", "answer": " 21"}
{"text": ": eat it D: give thanks E: pray\nOutput: 1.. The question asks for the solution to hunger that neolithic people might have used.\n2. We can determine that the neolithic period refers to a time in history when many people were involved in farming and agriculture. This was a major shift away from being hunters and gatherers.\n3. Hence, a possible solution to the problem of hunger that neolothic people might used was to be farmers. Thus, they could grow food.\n4. This also means that praying might not have been a part of neolithic culture and this is why option B: hunt for fodder is unlikely.\n5. Giving thanks, as an expression of gratitude, might be something that neolithic culture did or may have done, but it's not an immediate solution to hunger.\n6. So, the most probable solution to hunger was D: eat it.\nSo the final solution is D: eat it\n\nInput: John has a new bike.  He wants to put his chainless derrailleur into the bicycle's what?

Furthermore, the question specifically mentions that the person was hungry, which implies that the other options did not solve the problem of hunger.\n3-4. The remaining options, A, B, and C, would not be feasible solutions for a neolithic hunter-gatherer, as they involve external assistance and require a sufficient level of knowledge.

The passage talks about Neolithic people's response to hunger, indicating that they lacked food and were in need of sustenance.\n2) The answer can be inferred by analyzing the choices given and understanding the context of the passage.\n3) Choice A: \"Thank God\" implies a belief in a higher power or divine being; however, lacking food does not entail such beliefs, therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer. Choice B: \"Hunt for food\" indicates that Neolithic people used hunting as a food source, which conflicts with the lack of food mentioned earlier. Choice C: \"Ask for food\" suggests Neolithic people gathered or acquired food from other sources, but the phrase \"thank god for food\" shows that lacking food is not the main issue here. Choice D: \"Eat less\" is somewhat absurd as eating less results in lack of nutrition and can even lead to death as a side effect. A possible correct answer is Choice E:\n4) \"Eat less,\" given that Neolithic was likely a time of food scarcity and hunting was difficult, such a strategy can make sense. However, in some circumstances it might result in malnutrition or death.

{"text": ": fish D: farm animals E: forage for food\nOutput: 1) First, we need to look at the question which asks us to identify the neolithic person's solution to a problem and gives information about their hunger.\n2) From the given choices, we can identify that there were a few aspects of the neolithic lifestyle.\n3) The options 'Thank god' and 'foraging for food,' both refer to looking for food and are not directly related to specific methods of food acquisition.\n4) Another option 'farm animals' is vague, and doesn't specify the type of animal.\n5) Lastly, the question refers to a 'neolithic person,' not a person in general, so we can rule out the last option since it doesn't fit this context.\n6) Going through all the options, farm animals is the most specific option and could be classified as a neolithic activity, so this is the correct answer.\nSo the final solution to the problem is option Farm animals.\n\nInput: There was a lot of interest in how good the new restaurant was. It's in a beautiful setting, there's great food, the staff are very efficient and you can see they take pride to what?Choices:  A: doing a good job B: being very proud of their food C: being very kind D: eating in many restaurants E: making their customer satisfied\nOutput: 1.) We need to understand what the question asks us to determine.\n2.) First, we evaluate the given options to understand what's meant by taking pride in their work. \n3.) All the options can imply pride in the work done.\n4.) However, the given options only refer to the work of either the food staff or the restaurant management as they are directly related to the food as a service.\n5.) Based on the facts that the question emphasizes the \"good restaurant\" as the setting and environment it is in, we can infer that pride in the restaurant refers to the pride of the people using the restaurant's amenities versus the people who are working in the restaurant. Furthermore, the word \"pride\" in the context of working in the restaurant is likely a euphemism for \"taking pride in work.\"\n6.) Given this reasoning, the answer is C) being very kind.\nSo the final choice", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": ": start working at a job D: go home E: invent a food\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to identify the solution a Neolithic person used to deal with hunger.\n2) We are given that the Neolithic person was \"hungry\" and \"go home\" is a possible solution.\n3) However, the other options do not immediately fit in.\n4) Option A can be eliminated as \"thank god\" does not directly solve a problem and cannot be a solution to deal with hunger or a lack of food.\n5) Option B \"hunt for food\" can be eliminated as this activity is performed to obtain food rather than solve a problem.\n6) Option C \"start working at a job\" is an action that is taken to make money and/or have a source of income.\n7) Option D \"go home\" can be eliminated, as this is not necessarily the solution to a problem.\n8) Option E \"invent a food\" is a possibility that could potentially be the solution, but it does not directly involve solving hunger.\n9) Therefore, the solution is most likely to be E: \"invent a food\".\nSo the final solution answer is E: invent a food.\n\nInput: Your mother is cooking you dinner.

Because the flower of a pumpkin is a plant, it is not a fruit or a vegetable. So, we can eliminate C.\n\n3 A: If a pumpkin is considered either a flower or a fruit, then it is a flower. This option does not provide an accurate description", "answer": " 10080"}
{"text": ": gather food D: collect food E: make a fire\nOutput: 1. The question provides information about the neolithic person and their desire for food.\n2. The solutions given in the question are all associated with food gathering and preparation, indicating that the neolithic people hunted and gathered their food.\n3. Option A seems unlikely as it's unlikely the neolithic individual would have used this term in the context of food gathering.\n4. Option B is also unlikely as the question mentions gathering food, not hunting it.\n5. Option C seems plausible as gathering food would have been a prevalent activity for the neolithic group.\n6. Option D is also plausible as the neolithic period was notable for the use of fire and cooking food.\n7. In conclusion, the answer is most likely to be either C or D.\n8. Finally, based on the reasoning and context of the question, the answer is likely D: Collect food.\nSo the final choice is D: Collect food", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": search on wikipedia D: write a letter E: pray\nOutput: 1) First, we need to define the terms and understand their context. \"Neolithic\", refers to a period in human history that existed before the start of recorded history, and is characterised by the use of stone tools and the cultivation of crops.\n2) From these attributes, we can infer that the question is asking for a solution to a problem faced during the neolithic period.\n3) Now, the options: \"Thank God\" and \"Pray\" are related to prayer, which could be a way for people to solve problems during the neolithi period, although it's difficult to be 100% sure that praying and thanking God were the only two solutions people used.\n4) Options C and D are related to searching for answers or solutions on the internet (wikipedia), which might also be a way to solve problems during the Neolithic period. \n5) Option B \"Hunt for food\" is also an option, but it could have also been a problem if the person didn't know where to find food and had to hunt for it instead of simply searching for answers on Wikipedia.\n6) Therefore, given the context, the most likely answer is option A, \"Thank God.\"\nSo the final answer would be A: thank god\n\nInput: Dad asked for me to put the plastic jug in the kitchen.   Dad is my father,  He wants me to put it in, where? Choices:  Choices:  A kitchen B fridge C cupboard D closet E shelf\nOutput: 1st thing we need to do is recognize the question. This question is asking a specific location where the jug must be placed. Now let us look at the options.\n2. Options A to C could easily be ruled out, since the options aren't about the kitchen itself, but about the kitchen's contents.\n3. Option D could be ruled out, since if there is nothing in the closet, there is no use for anyone (including dad) to place the jug here.\n4. The remaining options are more specific in terms of placing the jug in a shelf or elsewhere, but they still do not describe where Dad wants it specifically.\n5. After exploring the options, we can deduce the location is '", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": ": start gathering D: invent technology E: grow some\nOutput: The question relates to a specific time in history when humans started using technology, specifically inventions of Neolithic.\n2. Inventions of Neolith (from agriculture to building things like wagons, ships, etc.; not limited to the technology of firearms)\n3. Neolithic hunter gatherer's solution to food scarcity was not hunting for food or gathering food as the focus is on agriculture. As they were hunters of a specific variety of food animals (not wild animals like wolves, cats or bears), hunting of wild prey was not a solution.\n4. The use of technology and innovation (such as fire) to create tools, inventions, and other forms of civilization was a prominent development during the Neolithic era.\n5. Additionally, the inventions made during the Neolith period were not just limited to technology. They also included building things like wagers and ships, and making pottery.\n6. Neolith people did not invent technology or tools like firearms to hunter food, the focus was on creating civilization and expanding their capabilities like creating tools, inventions, art, pottery and other forms of culture.\n7. Therefore based on the context, the answer is E : Grow food.\nSo the final and correct answer is E: grow food.", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": ": wait for food D: collect it E: steal it\nOutput: 1: The word 'neolithic' refers to a time period roughly from c. 11,000 BCE to c. 4500 BCE, and often describes the period of human cultural evolution after the paleolithic era (c. 2.5 million years ago to c. 40,000 B.C.E.) and before the introduction of metal and writing with the start of the bronze age c. 3200 BCE.\n2. The word 'hungry' is used in the present tense, which indicates that the description of the hungry person is happening at the present, or in real time.\n3. Based the description, the hungry person's solution to the food problem is to (A) thank God, (C) wait for food, (D) collect the food, or (E) steal the food.\n4. The word 'collect' refers to taking possession of something you do not have a right to. It is a type of theft or crime and can be interpreted as stealing.\n5. The word'solution' in the question refers to a specific action or behavior, which can be interpreted as the collecting of food.\n6. It cannot refer to an overall belief system or idea in the context of a religious solution to a problem.\n7. Therefore we can dismiss option A as an inappropriate answer because it is not a solution to a food problem but rather an act of praying to God.\n8. Similarly, option C cannot be the correct answer because it refers to waiting for food which is not the type of behavior or action that the question seeks to identify.\n9. Option D is incorrect for the same reasons outlined above: Collection of food is not an appropriate behavior or action to indicate a 'neolithic person' was hungry.\n10. Option E would be applicable if the context was different, as it can be interpreted as taking possession of or stealing the food.\n11. However, in this scenario, option E would not be a solution or behavior or action that would indicate a hungry person.\n12. Given the reasoning outlined above, the correct answer is B: hunt for the food.\nSo the final solution is B: hunt the food", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": ": plant a vegetable D: buy food E: eat whatever was available\nOutput: 1: The context of the question states that the neolithic person is hungry and is searching for a solution, so the options are possible solutions offered to them.\n2. However option \"B: Hunt for food\" is not viable as it's not feasible for one person to hunt for food.\n3. Option \"D: Buy food\" is another difficult option to fulfil as it was unlikely for neolithic people to have a currency at their disposal or the means to afford the money they would spend on food.\n4. Now, option\"E: Eat whatever is available\" is the most viable option as it is the only one that could be achieved with minimal effort.\n5. It's the only option that could be obtained and consumed quickly due to the scarcity of resources.\n6. Therefore, option E fits the context the best with the least amount of effort.\nSo the final option is E: eat whatever is available\n\nInput: The mushroom was tasty, in what way? Choices:  W: earthy B: woody C: smoky D: bitter E: starchy\nOutput: 1- The question provides details of the mushroom. The mushroom is described as tasty, in whatever way.\n2. Using this information, the choices can be narrowed down.\n3. Option A: 'Earthy' does not fit the context of the question as it is not a distinct enough description of the flavor.\n4. Option B: 'Woody' is also not a suitable option as it does not describe a unique flavor that sets the mushroom apart.\n5. Option C: 'Smoky' does not appear to be a flavor unique to the mushroom and does not fit the provided context.\n6. Option D: 'Bitter' is a distinct and unique flavor and is consistent with the description of the mushroom as being tasty in whatever way.\n7. Thus, the answer can be deduced as D: Bitter.\nSo the final choice is D: Bitter\n\nInput: A chicken was roasted for how long? Choices: 1 hour 30 minutes 2 hours 45 minutes W: 4", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": ": invent cooking D: gather around a fire E: invent religion\nOutput: 1.) We have to deduce from the given options. If the choice refers to a specific period in history then it has to be A (thanksgiving) Or if the answer has to do with religion then it has to be E (Invent religion). So from the given answer choices we can eliminate answers B (inventing cooking as an option or a solution here is not likely). And C (to solve this problem one has to gather fire or they dont have fire. But for the given context one does have fire). So out of the remaining answers B (Thank god) would be the best answer which we go with and hence choice D ( Gather around a fire) is the correct answer.\nSo the final choice is D: Gather around a fire\n\nInput: The _______ was a religious festival observed by the Roman Catholic Church in honour of the Virgin Mary. Choices:  A) ____ B) ____ C) Coronation of the Queen D) Feastday E) Feast of Assumption Feastday\nOutput: 1)  To make the question easier we can assume that 'the _______ was a roman catholic thing.\n2) As ____ is a feastday but coronation of the queen is not held on feastday and feastday is a feastday itself and a festival and not an event held in its honour, option E (Feastday- Feast of assumption) should be the answer. Hence, the correct answer is E: Feastday - Feast of Assumption.\nSo the final  choice is E: Feast of Assumption", "answer": " 72"}

The person looking at the options is hungry, so a person cannot wait for a storm. \n3. If the person wants to use stored food, the person must first store the food.\n4. If the person needs to hunt for food or plant a garden, then it's best to do that as soon as possible.\n5. 'Hunting for food', 'planting a garden', and'storing food' require time and resources. \n6. Therefore, the person must decide between the options based on the time and availability of resources.\n7. If the person has the resources and enough time, then the person would best choose to 'Hunt for Food' \n\nInput: The person is worried about being eaten by a tiger, so which of these choices do they have? Choices:  Wear shoes A: 100% chance of survival B: 1% chance of survival C: 80% chance of surviving D: less than 30% chance of survive\nOutput: 1: First, the options 'wear shoes' and 'less than 30% of survival' are unlikely to be chosen, because they do not relate to the context.\n2. The remaining options are related to a person who doesn't have shoes.\n3. 'A - 100% of survival', the person is certain to survive without any risks or concerns.\n4. 'B - 1% chance of Survival', because there is a small chance of survival, the person is still worried.\n5. Based on this reasoning, both the answers are unlikely to be chosen.\n6. The third option A is the correct one.\n7. The remaining options are unrelated, and not useful to the context.\n8. The person doesn't have shoed and is worried they may be eaten by a tigter.\n9. Option B states the exact opposite of what is needed. This is not useful information.\n10. In conclusion, the correct answer is A: 10% chance of survivability\nSo the final answer  is A", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": ": go fishing D: look for fruit E: hunt for food\nOutput: 1) We understand that the context is about the neolithic person being hungry and their solution to solve it.\n2. Based on the context given, the most logical solution to the predicament is hunting for food.\n3. Hunting for wild animals is a common method for the survival of man since the old stone age, and this has been prevalent till today where man seeks to satisfy his need for food and other requirements through hunting. This method of hunting can also include catching fish in the river or pond.\n4. Going fishing is not entirely relevant because of how rare it is today and how rare it was in the past. As stated earlier, the context is about man hunting to satisfy his need for survival.\n5. Finding fruit could also be an option if man is able to locate it naturally in his surrounding. However, this would not be an effective solution to his immediate problem of not being able to satisfy his requirements because of hunger.\n6. Thanking God for providing the man with food will neither satisfy the hunger nor the problem of the man being hungry.\n7. Therefore based on the context as well as the options of A(hunting) and E(hunting), the answer to the question is A: hunting for food.\nSo the final answers is A: hunting for his food\n\nInput: John wanted to leave, but he was afraid what of?

The possible reasons for John's fear could include a situation whereby he does not know whether it is safe to stay or leave, such as being in a dangerous environment.\n3. Another possible reason could be the possibility of facing unwanted consequences if he decides to leave or stay.\n4. A third possible reason could be the fear of the unknown, or uncertainty about what might happen if he decides to stay", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": ": gather food D: cook it E: grow it\nOutput: 1.) The question seeks to understand which solution a \"neolithic(e) person\" used.\n2.) Based on the context, it' the question is about the early human era who was hungry and didn't have the means of ready availability like we do in the modern day.\n3.) To solve this problem, we must understand the options available to them.\n4.) Option A: 'thank-god' is inappropriate and suggests the solution as one depending on faith. This is different from the situation where a person needs to eat but doesn't have the ability to hunt, gather, or cook.\n5.) Option B: 'hunt for food' seems reasonable as a possible solution. Although, the options don't explain whether this solution is possible given their circumstances.\n6.) 'Gather food' could also be a solution, but again there is no context that would make this feasible and without technology to do so.\n7.) Option C: 'cook it' seems reasonable as a solution for a hungry person trying to fill their stomach. It's also relevant based on the context of wanting to know how a hungry man would solve his food problems.\n8.) Option D: 'grow it' sounds like an agricultural/agricultural option. However, it doesn't seem realistic considering the context of a hungry man trying to find a solution to his situation.\n9.) Option E: 'cook it' is the most likely solution to a hungry person trying for food/feeding themselves, but is also an option is provided as the correct answer to the problem.\n10.) Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is Option C: cook it.\nSo the final answeer is C: cook it\n\nInput: Someone might have a lot of love for dogs but not much for horses.

{"text": ": prepare food D: invent tools E: wait for animals to die so they could eat them\nOutput: 1.\" The problem is expressed as \"The neolithic person,\" which implies that the person belonged to the Neolithic era.\n2. They \"were hungry,\" so the problem could be addressed by either \"thanking God\" or \"inventing tools.\"\n3. However, \"thanking God for food\" seems irrational and unlikely, given that \"thanking God is usually associated with praying for guidance, blessings and support, instead of asking for food or material things.\"\n4. Therefore, it is most likely that the neolithic person will \"invent tools,\" as this is more in line with the context of the problem and the time period in which it took place.\n5. Option C - \"prepare food\" - does not seem to be an option based on the context of the problem, as the \"neolithic person\" did not have any cooking equipment or access to food preparation tools.\n6. Option D - \"invent tools\" - is the most logical option in this context, with the neolithic era being known for its inventions and innovations.\n7. Option D is also more specific than \"prepare food,\" which could be used to describe any type of food preparation and does not specify what tools would be invented.\n8. Finally, Option E - \"wait for animals to die so that they could eat them\" - is highly unlikely in this context, as the neolithic period was characterized by hunting and gathering, and not relying on other animals to provide food.\n9. Therefore we can rule out A and E, and conclude that the answer is D: invent tools\nSo the final answer will be D: invent tools", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": ": invented food truck D: invented food delivery E: invented farming and gardening\nOutput: 1: The question gives us a snapshot of a neolithic person who is hungry and we are asked to infer their solution to this problem. \n2. The question does not mention any specific solution that is being talked about but only asks us to assume that the hungry person invented certain solutions to feed him or herself \n3. First, the most straightforward explanation of this question would be \"Hunted for food\" If this is the only solution to the problem then this would be the most accurate answer. \n4. But here we need to consider whether \"The neolithic person invented a food truck\" or \"The neolithisc person invented food delivery\" or \"The neoilithic person invented farming and cultivation\" is also a viable solution to the problem.\n5. Out of these three options, \"The neolithc person invented a food delivery\" or \"the neolithic person found the idea of growing a food source to feed him\" or \" The neolithic hungry person solved his problem by eating some wild animals in the area. \" are plausible solutions and that is why they are part of the options. \n6. Now, If we take them and compare to \"The neolithiic person invented food truck\" or The neolithic hunter invented food truck\", then we can infer that \"Invented food truck\" is less likely to be the right answer than Invented farming and garden.\n7. So the solution most likely to solve the problem of the neolithic person can be \"Invented food delivery\" Or \"Invented farming and food garden\".\nSo the final answers can either be \"Invented farms and food garden\" Or Invented food delivery\".\n\nInput: A child, being a child, would likely behave the same as a what?

{"text": ": farm food by growing crops D: grow plants for food E: raise animals for food\nOutput: 1) The question mentions that a neolithic person is 'hungry'.\n2) The options which can be ruled out are A) \"thank god\" that makes the question irrelevant and C) \"farm food by growing crops\" because we cannot farm food that already exists.\n3) The options which remain can be ruled out too. \"Raising animals\" may not be an option for a person of the neolithic era because they may not have had the tools to do so. Moreover, it is unclear whether animals are grown or raised, as the question only mentions a single word \"to\", making the interpretation ambiguous.\n4) Option D which is \"grow plants for food\" is a possible solution to hunger because plants can be used to provide food.\n5) Option E which is \"raise plants\" is not necessary because the use of the word \"for\" suggests that plants can be used as food.\n6) Option B which is \"Hunt for food\" can be one way to meet a hunger problem, but it is not the only one, and the question does not explicitly mention whether hunting is the only solution being considered or not.\n7) Therefore, based on the context, the most likely solution to the problem of a neolithic being who is hungry, is to use plants to grow food.\n8) This answer also stands out as most logical because the other two answer choices - A and C - are incorrect, while option B is not explicitly mentioned as the most likely solution.\n9) The answer is then \"D: Grow plants for food\"\nSo the final answer can be A or D: Grow plants for eat\n\nInput: The king was a bad communicator.

This information provides a context for understanding what is the hungriness of the person. They could be hungry because they don't have money, power, etc. or because they have just walked a long distance, and therefore they are hungry. These things could be a possibility but the only thing the question is asking is what was their solution to a problem.\n2. The best possible answer should be the one who helped him in this situation of \u201chunger\u201d or what he did for himself. To do this, one has to analyse all the options carefully and see which will make the best sense or will be the best possible answer for the question.\n3. The first thing someone can do to survive is to eat because they are hungry.\n4. If the person is hungry and does not have something, then he must \u201chunt for food\u201d to eat.\n5. Hence, from the given options, only option C (to cook food) is the right one.\nSo the final answers is C: cook food\n\nInput: He said he wants to go home for Christmas and then he realized his dad would have a new girlfriend. What did he want him to do? Choices:  - A: break up with his father B: make an issue C: try and get his parents together D: go home anyway E: let his parents be\nOutput: 1) This is a typical situation when there is a problem for some people to keep their parents together, which is more common for divorced parents. It could be this person who also wants this to happen, either because he has an issue with his dad or because he is worried about his parents getting separated, since he is also the son of the parents. This is only possible when parents get together because the whole of the family may get happier or the person may get more comfortable with going home.\n2) There is no reason given. It could be related to the divorced parents, which is the thing. Also the whole of the family will become happier.\n3) No, it could be as if he wants to let his parents be so that the family is more united.\n4) No reason.\n5) It can", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": ": eat D: pray E: beg\nOutput: 1) First we need to understand key characteristics of Neolithic people:\n- The period is defined by the use of stone tools\n- It is a transitional stage between two eras (Eg: Stone Age and Metal Age)\n- People of this era used fire to cook food and to keep warm\n2) Now, we focus on the options:\n- God can be a deity or concept which is invoked for a solution.\n- Food can be sought through a hunt which can be a solution to hunger\n- Thanks can be directed to God\n- Begging can be done for food\n- Praying is a type of communication with God and can be used to seek a solution or thank God\n3) We can now understand that an option which does not directly relate to God or religious concepts can be ruled out, so option D has to be eliminated, similarly option A does not mention fire which is a specific characteristic of this era, hence this too has to be eliminated.\n4) As food can be sought through a variety of options, including hunting or praying to God, we can eliminate option E, as it is a solution which involves only food.\n5) Options with food as a solution are eliminated, leaving us with only C: eat.\nSo the final conclusion is that the neolithic person would have simply eaten to satisfy their hunger.\nSo the final choice is option C: Eat\n\nInput: We've heard that \"all\" mammals give birth to live young, but one species in particular does something quite different.  What species can we talk about where the females give birth to eggs instead of living young?  Choices:  A) Mammals B) Elephants C) Mice D) Penguins E) Sperm whales\nOutput: 1.) We can assume that this question would be asking about a common feature of mammals, where mammals give birth.\n2.) In this question, \"live young\" could mean only newborn children being referred to, but this seems unlikely given the options available.\n3.) In this case, option A \"Mammals\" can be eliminated as mammals which give birth can easily be identified as there are numerous mammals in the world.\n4.) Similarly, option B \"Elephants\" too can", "answer": " 350"}
{"text": ": invent crops D: eat dirt E: eat weevils\nOutput: 1) First, we need to identify the exact meaning of the term \"neolithic person\", which means being concerned with agriculture and hunting.\n2) The question itself specifies that the person was \"hungry\", so the options would likely not be related to agriculture or crops in general.\n3) Looking at the options: Option A mentions thanking god, which doesn't necessarily address the issue or solve the person's hunger.\n4) Option B mentions hunting for food, which is a viable solution to address hunger, but it specifies that they would have to \"invent crops\" first, which can be understood as preparation or planning for the possibility of hunting for food in future.\n5) Option C specifies \"invent crops\", which again hints toward preparation or planning for later stages and does not specifically address hunger in a short-term manner.\n6) Option D suggests \"eating dirt\", which is something that would be likely to make a person more sick than solve hungriness.\n7) Only option E \"eat weevils\" could be interpreted as an attempt to address a hunger problem.\n8) Therefore, the answer is likely E: eat weevil.\nSo the final solution is E: eat weevilly\n\nInput: The pink spore was not growing like the other spores, but the spores needed more sun.  They grew fast after what? Choices: A: water B: sun C: salt D: rain E: sunny weather\nOutput: 1.\\tFirst, let us look at what kind of spore is being discussed.\\tThe answer is provided as Pink Spore. \\tThe spore grows well under sunlight. The other spores may still grow well in other conditions. \\tThough sun was added to make them grow and the sun can enhance photosynthesis but it doesn't provide any direct nutrient. So salt is not applicable.\\tIt was the water which enables them to grow well even in different conditions. \\tThe sunny weather is not necessary for the growth of the spore as it grows well in other conditions as well. \\tAfter the sun, the spore grew fast.\\tTherefore we can say that answer is A:\\tWater.", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": go to the restaurant D: cook some food E: ask for help\nOutput: 1.'Neolithic' refers to an era of early human society, specifically referring to people who lived during the Stone Age. \n2. The context suggests that the people in this era did not have access to advanced food-making technologies or convenience stores as we currently do. They would need to depend on themselves or other humans to meet their needs.\n3. This presents us with different options that could potentially solve them.\n4. Looking the choices: Option A: 'Thank god' is out of the context and cannot be an effective solution.\n5. Option C: 'Go to the restaurant' is not plausible in this context as they did not have access to modern conveniences.\n6. Option D: 'Cook some food' is a logical solution however, it does not explain how a person in the Neolithic era would cook. \n7. Option E: 'Ask for help' is also a logical option. However 'help' could be from other people or from animals as the context is about people.\n8. Option E is the most plausible and most relevant solution.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is E: A: ask for help\nSo the final answer was E: ask for help", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": ": farm it D: eat wild fruits E: cook it\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about what solution neolithic people used when they were hungry.\n2) The options provide information about various activities that neolithic people engaged in when they were hungry, these can be categorized into two parts: seeking food and cooking food.\n3) Looking at options A and B, which ask whether they should thank God or hunt for food, it seems that the focus of the option is seeking food and not cooking it, so these can be eliminated from the list.\n4) The remaining options are all related to the use of cooking as a solution when hungry.\n5) If we look at the options E, C, and D, the word 'cook' is missing and it doesn't provide a full solution.\n6) Therefore, E should be eliminated, as it doesn't seem to be a full solution.\n7) Option C describes using fire to cook food, but this is part of cooking and not cooking specifically.\n8) Option D describes eating \"wild fruits\", but this is also part of cooking: cooking wild fruits to make them edible.\n9) Therefore, option D \"to cook it\" refers to a complete cooking process, making it the correct answer.\nSo the final answers is I: to cook it.\n\nInput: The answer to this question rest on which of the following?

{"text": ": eat some lunch D: prepare dinner E: go back to sleep\nOutput: 1) The context is around the neolithic person and what they did when they were asked.\n2) The key phrase here is \"hungry, so\u2026\" - which indicates that the neolithic people were thinking about solving the problem they were presented with.\n3) There are two options which don't involve food, which doesn't make much sense.\n4) Another option that was proposed here is - \"eat some lunch\".\n5) In the context, the person is described as a caveman, and we know that they do hunt and eat.\n6) Since, \"preparing dinner\" and \"eat some luch\" will require more time than just hunt for food, the likely answer should be - \"D: hunt for food.\nSo the final answe is D: hunt for food\n\nInput: The man was very confident about his performance and what? Choices: A: got a good review B: was very excited C: gave a really great show D: received a lot of applauds E: got a standing ovation\nOutput: 1: The man was confident about his performance and therefore, gave a really great show.\n2: The performance is what mattered here, not if someone reviewed his show.\n3: This could be any of the choices as we can expect any of the reactions mentioned.\n4: Only the choice \"E: get a standing ovation\" seems like it is the outcome of the show.\nSo the final answers is E: get a standing ovatio", "answer": " 1150"}
{"text": ": grow plants D: look for help E: find shelter\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the solution that a person in the Neolithic era would likely have used if they were hungry.\n2) The options given provide different solutions to the problem of finding food, but none of them are specific to Neolithic hunters.\n3) Looking at the options: A: thank god - Neolithic huntsmen weren't using modern technology to find food.\n4) B: hunt for Food - Neolithic hunter-gatherers would not likely have been able to 'hunt for food' because they didn't use guns or other modern methods. \n5) C: grow plants - This is not a specific Neolithic strategy for finding food.\n6) D: look for help - This is not a distinct Neolithic solution to finding food.\n7) E: find shelter - This was likely a strategy used by more advanced hunter-gatherer groups.\n8) Therefore, the answer must be B:hunt for food\nSo the final answer  is B: hunt for\n\nInput: If a company offers a product or service for free you know the company must be what? Choices: A: making a profit in other ways B: doing badly C: having trouble D: growing E: making money\nOutput: 1.) The question asks if a company providing a product or service for \"free\" can be indicative of profit, problem, growth, etc.\n2.) Looking at the various options: \na)'making a profit in other ways' seems applicable, but 'free' implies not charging money and not expecting a profit.\nb) 'doing badly' could be related to the company experiencing financial problems.\nc) 'having trouble' could be considered, as 'free' products wouldn't be profitable.\nd) 'growing' might be suitable, as offering products or services for 'free' might be part of a growth strategy for a company.\ne)'making money' does not fit as the question does not indicate money directly associated with the 'free' product or service. \n3) However, based on the given context, option D:growing seems to be the most appropriate answer, since offering something for 'free' indicates that it's a product", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": ": create tool D: grow crop E: build shelter\nOutput: 1 First, the problem addressed is \"The neolithic person's hunger\" this tells us that the problem was an ongoing one of a lack of food.\n2. Looking at the options, option A \"thank God\" doesn't seem to relate to the problem and more so could be a comment or an opinion made on the hunger problem. Hence, it can be rejected.\n3. Option C \"create a tool\" is an answer that is specific, but doesn't really relate to the problem. Anything could be called a tool, but specifically it needs to be something that was used to create/make food, not a tool that can be used elsewhere.\n4. Option D \"grow crops\" is an answer that would solve the problem but doesn't directly relate to \"hungry\". Again it can be reassessed and rejected as an answer.\n5. There is only one specific answer that directly relates to \"hungry\", Option E \"build shelter\" a shelter or house is something that can be built to help to solve the problem of hunger.\nTherefore, the answer is E \"build shelter\".\nSo the finals answer is E: build shelter\n\nInput: A person who is very sensitive to noise might prefer what? Choices: A: loud music B: quiet streets C: loud parties D: quite time E: silence\nOutput: 1 As the question requires an answer that will fit with the sentence 'A person who is very sensitive...', we need to identify an option with a specific and unique characteristic which will be consistent with the sentence.\n2. We can eliminate the options 'A: loud music' as this is not an attribute specific to the context of being very sensitive to noise, and would only create noise.\n3. Option 'C: loud parties' would be a cause of noise and not suitable to be paired with'very sensitive to noise'.\n4. As option 'D: quite time' is an obvious contradiction of'very sensitive to noise', we can also rule it out.\n5. Option 'E: silence' is a natural fit for'very sensitive to noise' as an 'extreme' or 'excessive' response.\n6. So the answer from the available choices is 'E: silence'.\nSo the final answer will be E:", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": ": hope and pray D: use tooth and claw E: kill\nOutput: 1: The description doesn't reveal the origin or location of the person, but the question indicates a sense of desperation during famine.\n2. There is no indication as to whether the person is female or male, nor is there any indication as to their culture.\n3. Option A 'thank god' is not a logical or realistic response in response to starvation due to a lack of food.\n4. Option B 'hunt for food' could be a potential strategy for sourcing food, however, there are no given constraints for what type of food the person can hunt for.\n5. Additionally, the wording \"tooth and claw\" suggests that the person must struggle against other animals for the food, which could be a potential source of stress and conflict.\n6. Option D 'use teeth and claw' provides a more specific, realistic, and likely response to the problem of famine.\n7. Thus, looking at the options given, the most likely solution is D: use teeth and claw.\nSo the final response is D: use teeth an claw\n\nInput: What's the meaning of \u201cno good deed goes unpunished\u201d?Choices:  A: doing good deeds will be punished B: even good deeds will be rejected C: you will be punished for doing good deeds D: no good deeds will go unpunished E: you will be punisheed for doing good deeds\nOutput: 1) In order to understand the meaning of the phrase \u201cno good deed go unpunished,\u201d it is important to consider the context or situation in which it is used.\n2. The phrase \u201cno good deeds go unpunished\u201d is often used to express the idea that doing good things for others or society is not always appreciated, recognized, or rewarded.\n3. It can also be interpreted as a cynical statement that implies that people who do good deeds or help others may eventually face negative consequences, such as being punished or criticized for their actions.\n4. The phrase seems to express the idea that not all good deeds are appreciated or rewarded and that doing good things can sometimes cause more problems than solutions, thus resulting in punishment.\n5.

The most likely solution to the problem of hunger for the neolithic people is having or growing their own food.\n3. Hunting for food is not a viable solution for neolithic people because they are dependent on agriculture for their livelihood.\n4. Going to the market is not necessarily a viable option as there may not have been established trade networks or enough food in the local area to meet the needs of the people.\n5. Thanking God or praying for food is not a solution that the neolithics would have resorted to.\n6. Therefore, the most likely solution for the neolithics was \"D: grow their own food\".\nSo the final option is D: grow their own.", "answer": " 249"}
{"text": ": leave D: ask someone for food E: pray to god\nOutput: 1) The question is focused on the solution to the problem of hunger, which was a common issue faced by people in the neolithic era.\n2) The options provided can be grouped into three different categories: thanking God, asking for help, and hunting for food.\n3) Option A: thanking God, would not be a practical solution in this scenario as there was no guarantee that God would provide food, and this option presumes that the person believes in God. Similarly, option B: hunting for food, would involve a lot of effort and risk involved, especially if the person is alone, and the chance of success may not high.\n4) Option C: Asking for help, is a reasonable solution, as it is more feasible and the chance of success is higher.\n5) Option D: Eat, is an intuitive answer as it is the basic need for survival, but it doesn'y necessarily solve the problem of hunger in the long term.\n6) Option E: Praying to God, is similar to option A, and does not provide a solution to the problem.\n7) Therefore, option C: Ask for Help, is the most suitable solution to this problem.\nSo the final message is C: Ask for help\n\nInput: Which of the following best describes the phrase \u201ctoo hot for a woolly jumper\u201d Choices:  A B C D E F\nOutput: 1: First question to consider is the term 'jumper', which is used to refer to a sweater or a knitted sweater. Sweaters are usually made of wool or another type of fabric, such as cotton or polyester.\n2. Second, the phrase suggests that it is unsuitable to wear a wool-based sweater in warm weather due to the fabric's tendency to retain heat and keep people warm.\n3. Let's further understand the options by looking at their definitions and their relation to this question\n4. A) Very humid; wet. B) Very cold\n5. 'Awash' is an adjective that means 'covered with' or'soaked with water' in the sense of the phrase 'to be awash with water' which may be used to describe the wetness or humidity of hot places.", "answer": " 6"}

Solution C: Go to war sounds like a drastic action, not justified to solve this particular problem.\n3. Solution D: use spear makes sense in this context, so we can eliminate it.\n4. Solution E: Create technology is not possible for a person, but for a civilization.\n5. So the only logical choice is B: hunt for the food.\nSo the final answear is B: hunt fo the food\n\nInput: The bunny was scared, so it was trying to run away. What was the bunny's situation? Choices: 1. Scared 2. Scared 3. Scared 4. Panic 5. Confused\nOutput: 1.) The question describes the bunny being scared and trying to run away.\n2. Based on what we know about the situation, we can determine whether the bunny was in a state of being scared.\n3. Panic and confusion are states of mind, similar to being scared, that are based on external factors and not necessarily a result of simply being scared.\n4. Since the bunny is trying to run away due to being scared, rather than fearing what could happen or experiencing mixed emotions, it can be inferred that the bunny was indeed fearful.\n5. From the available choices, it is thus plausible to conclude that the bunny' s situation was one of being scared. \nSo the final anssewr is 5. Confused.\n\nInput: You can't eat a fish.

{"text": ": start a fire D: go to the grocery store E: ask for food\nOutput: 1-2. First, let's understand the context of the question. The neolithic era is generally regarded as the start of modern civilization and was a time of significant change, including many social and technological advances. One of the most significant advances was the development of agriculture, which allowed for a more reliable and predictable food supply.\n\n3. Going back to the choices given, options A, B, and D can be eliminated for this question, as they do not necessarily fit the context of the question and are not relevant to the advancements made in the neolithic era. So, it can be inferred from the given context that the choices C, E are most fitting for the context.\n\n4. Option E is asking for permission for something, so we can strike this one, making Option D the best option for the context\n\n5. The rest of the options can be eliminated as they do not specifically mention fire, which is a key technology that was developed during the neolithic period\n\n6. The advances in agriculture allowed for the development of more reliable food sources, which led to food abundance and eventually, an increase in population. This led to an increased demand for food, and with the development of fire, neolithic people could prepare food more efficiently and use it for cooking and preservation.\n\n7. Option E: Ask for food - This does not make sense as the neolithic people were adept at producing their own food. Since they were hungry and had access to agricultural produce and other food sources, they should have been able to provide their own food without asking for help. The option is not feasible.\n\n8. The question was about the advancements made by the neolithic peoples, and there is no mention of any difficulty in obtaining food. Therefore, the most suitable option is Option C - Start a fire.\n\nSo the final answer has to be C: Start a fire.", "answer": " 180"}
{"text": ": eat the plants they could find D: make what they needed E: dig up some roots\nOutput: 1) First, we need to have an overview of the provided choices to analyze the suitability of any of them as the solution to the problem.\n2) Since the solution is meant to be a short-term one, the choice of \"Make what they needed\" doesn't seem suitable as it would require some planning and effort to make anything.\n3) Another choice that seems to be out of the scope of the problem is \"Dig up some roots\".\n4) Of the remaining two choices, it seems most plausible that \"hunt for food\" was the solution because that is the most direct action one can take when facing a food shortage.\n5) Looking at the context of the question, it is clear that the neolithic person didn't find food to be immediately available and that they were therefore forced to hunt or find other sources of food.\n6) Therefore, the answer is B: hunt for Food.\nSo the final, answer is B: hunted for food.\n\nInput: She was asked by her brother to give him a quarter out of a dollar and she gave him a what instead? Choices: .05 B: Half C: Fourth D: None of these. E: Third\nOutput: 1.) This question is about a situation where a person is asked to give their brother a quarter from a dollar, and the person instead gave their brother half a dollar.\n2. The question implies that the person gave their brother half of the dollar and not just half of a quarter and that they did it intentionally to deceive their brother.\n3.) This means that the person was intentionally dishonest and trying to steal money from their brother rather than actually helping him.\n4.) In looking at the 5 available choices for the answer, it is important to determine which of the choices best suit the situation and context of the question.\n5.) From the context of the question it can be deduced that the person was given a dollar and asked to divide it between her and her brother, in which she intentionally stole from her brother.\n6.) Option C Fourth contains the number 4 which is not what the person actually gave to her brother as it was only $0.50, not a fourth of the entire doll", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": eat it raw D: plant vegetables E: cultivate wheat\nOutput: 1 The question asks about the solution adopted by the neolithic person in response to their hunger.\n2. The neolithic period, also known as the Stone Age or the New Stone Age, marked a significant shift in human history, from hunting and gathering to settled agriculture.\n3. From the options given, option D: Plant vegetables appears to be the most suitable answer.\n4. The choice 'hunt for food,' while perhaps an action that was taken, doesn't seem to directly address the hunger issue.\n5. The option 'Thank God' is unlikely to be a plausible answer, as it doesn't align with the context of the question and is also vague.\n6. The option 'Eat it raw' would likely require a specialized set of conditions and possibly involve a limited diet, and not necessarily be applicable for all people.\n7. The option 'Cultivate Wheat' is the most appropriate answer, as it describes a specific action that the neolithic community could take to address their hunger issues.\n8. The word 'cultivate wheat' suggests that the neoliths could plant wheat plants and cultivate them to produce grains, which could be used for food, be given away to others, stored for later use or sold for profit, making it a suitable choice.\n9. Therefore the answer is D: Cultivate Wheat\nSo the final answer would be D: cultivate wheat", "answer": " 600"}
{"text": ": work hard D: cook E: pray\nOutput: 1) The context of the problem suggests that the neolithic people had limited resources and were struggling to find food, which is a common problem associated with poverty and hunger.\n2). Looking at the options, they are characterized as \"solutions\" to this problem, which indicates that they are not intended to be understood as causes for the issue.\n3. It is important to note that the question does not explicitly state what exactly the neolithic person has done to find a solution, therefore, options A and E cannot be eliminated as causes of the issue.\n4. Option B can be eliminated because it is unlikely that the neolithics were capable of hunting wild animals or growing their own food due to limited resources, as mentioned in the context.\n5. Option C can be eliminated as it emphasizes on the act of working hard, which can be a solution to the problem but is not the primary cause of the issue.\n6. Finally, Option D is the most logical choice, as cooking food is a crucial aspect of ensuring that a person has proper nutrition. By cooking food, the neolithic could have improved the nutritional value of their meals and reduced the risk of starvation or malnutrition.\n\nSo the final answer\n\nInput: The answer to all your problems is at the end of your arm, what is your problem? Choices: 1. my body 2. my arm 3. my self 4. my happiness\n\nOutput: 1st: We understand that the solution to all problems is at the end our arm, which suggests that the problem is likely to be somewhere else.\n2nd: The context suggests that the body is likely not the problem, as having a working body alone cannot solve all problems.\n3rd: The context suggests that our body cannot cause all our problems, as our body is not the problem, but the solution.\n4th: The context suggests that solutions don't come easily, and that the problem isn't about happiness.\nSolution: The answer is our mind, as this is the place where we typically have our problems and desires.\n\nInput: Which type of dog is loyal and obedient and not too noisy?

{"text": ": look up in the sky D: grow some food E: create a fire\nOutput: 1: This is a \"Why is this answer correct?\" question.\n2: The given options are logical solutions to this particular dilemma faced by the Neolithic person, but all of them can be debatable.\n3: Hunting for food would require finding game, which may have required either hunting abilities or a hunting tool.\n4: Hinting at the sky may be linked to finding food through astronomical signs related to the timing of the seasons. However, this may involve knowledge of specific phenomena such as changes in the lunar cycles or the alignment of stars with particular planets.\n5: Growing our own food is perhaps the simplest way to ensure a sustainable food source and reduce the need to hunt, but would likely require knowledge and practice to successfully cultivate crops.\n6: Creating a fire would require the knowledge and ability to construct it, which may have taken time and resources that could have been employed by more efficient alternatives.\n7: The actual answer is \"D: grow some food.\"\n8: The Neolithic person would likely have to use trial and error in order to figure out when and how to grow their own food, but once they achieved this, it would be a reliable source of sustenance.\nSo the final choice is D: grow some food.\n\nInput: All the gays in the world would move to what state if it had a law that forbade homosexuality?

None of the given states actually have laws that forbid homosexuality, however there is a state that has laws that criminalize homosexuality, a state that is not one of the given choices. The correct choice is the state that criminalizes homosexuality.\n3.) This question asks specifically about criminalizing homosexuality, rather than about laws that restrict marriage or other rights for gay people.\n4.) The question is not asking about laws that were enacted in the past or have since been repealed.\n5.) It is clear that the reason why an anti-homosexuality law would cause the gays in this world to move", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": pray D: create fire E: none of the above\nOutput: 1) The question asks about a specific solution that was used during the Neolithic period to help solve a specific problem, which in this case, is hunger.\n2. We can eliminate the options which do not fit the specific problem and the time frame: There was no thanks to be given in the Neolithic era given the lack of religion.\n3. The options of hunting and praying would apply here but are not exclusive to this problem.\n4. One distinct option is to 'create fire'. We can infer that the problem during the Neolith age was associated with fire as the main source of cooking.\n5.

B: Hunt for food: this option could refer to both gathering and hunting for food as both strategies would require some effort and could lead to increased food supply.\n6. C: pray for it: this option does not directly relate to the specific problem of being hungry, but would include some form of ritual or practice related to the belief in god, which may or may not have been relevant to the neolithic people. Option D: grow plants: this option directly relates to the problem of being hungry and would be a way to increase food supply through growing plants in their environment.\n7. E: make soup: this option is a type of food preparation and would help increase the food supply available to the neolithics.\n8. Therefore, from the information provided, the most likely solution to the problem of hunger is D: grow plants.\nSo the final option is D: grow plants\n\nInput: A bite is in general an occasion when you have a snack.

The first thing we need to do to solve this question is to know the context of the council meeting; in general, it is for sharing ideas and decisions for the sake of the community.\n2.) With that understanding, we can see that there is a requirement for an equal voice at the council meeting based on the wording of the question.\n3.) The options presented in the question are: committee, jury, town council, committee of the whole, and small group.\n4.) Option A) (committee) does not refer explicitly to committee, but still speaks of a group of people.\n5.) Options B, C and D (Town council, committee of the whoe, and small group) are more likely to fulfill the criteria for the question because they are groups of people assembled for specific purposes.\n6.) While Option E may refer to a \"small group\", the phrase \"of the whole\" refers to a group of people in the larger community, which is different from a small group of people.\n7.)

{"text": ": pray D: wait E: do nothing\nOutput: 1  The question mentions that a 'neolithic person,' which suggests that the problem was faced by people living in the Stone Age.\n2. Stone Age people were hunters and gatherers, who faced the problem of food scarcity due to the limited resources and lack of agriculture.\n3. Looking at the options, we can observe that praying and waiting for God to provide food were common practices among Stone Age people.\n4. Praying to 'god' was a solution that many people prayed for as a quick and easy way to get food without having to work hard.\n5. Praying to God was not the answer because the issue was solved by hunting for food which is in option C.\n6. Similarly, option D, which involves waiting for God, is also not valid because it does not provide an active solution to the problem.\n7. Therefore the answer is B: hunt for the food.\nSo the final answers are B: hunt for god\n\nInput: A man is holding an envelope with what?

We know that the neolithic period took place between 8000 BC and 2000 BC; Therefore, the neolithic people were hungry. As the option 'Hunt for food' doesn't fit the time period (in fact neolithic people lived primarily through gathering foods by hunting, fishing, and collecting plants and fruits); option D is eliminated.\n3. We have eliminated the options D, E, and C as it does not make sense from the time period perspective, and B, that does not provide any solution.\n4.

A major source of food for hunters and gatherers is hunting animals. They also gather and pick wild fruits.\n2.) To satisfy their hunger, they hunt animals. They do not have farms so they do not know how to plant them. If they do not get food, they would starve to death.\n3.) None of the given options represent the way the neolithic people solve the food problem. Hence they are to be rejected.\n4.) The people of the neolithic age live in caves or homes built of animal skin covering wooden sticks. The only option that can be said to be used during hunting is the option 'B: go on a hunt for food'.\n5.) Since the caves that they live in are not as big as today's houses they do not even have a car. They must have walked long distances if they wanted to hunt and they had no transportation.\n6.)

{"text": ": share with friends D: kill animals E: eat raw\nOutput: 1: The question refers to a specific individual but not a generalized group, which means the solution to their problem is likely to be limited to them and not representative of the overall behavior of the neolithic.\n2: The context of the question states that the neolithic person is hungry and their proposed solution to the problem is eating raw food which would be impossible for them to consume due to lack of cooking options at that time.\n3: This indicates that the neolithc person's solution to the problem is likely to be either \"share with friends\" or \"kill animals\".\n4: The choice \"share with friends\" is a viable option for a group of people who have access to resources or other means of producing food, but this is not the case for the neolithic individual who is alone and without access to means of making food.\n5: The choice \"kill animals\" is also a possible solution to the neolithic problem, but it is not without its own challenges. \n6: For starters, it would require the neolithic to be able to acquire and use weapons, which may not have been available at this stage of human development.\n7: Also, killing animals would mean obtaining the food and then figuring out how to prepare it, which may have been difficult for the neolithc to do alone.\n8: Thus, while the choice \"kill animals\" may have been an option, it would be unlikely to be a feasible solution in the context of the neolithical problem.\n9: The key point to keep in mind is that neolithic people did not have easy access to cooking tools like fire or pots and pans, as these would not have been invented at that time.\n10: Therefore, the most likely solutions at that time would be either to share food with friends or to hunt for food and consume it raw.\n11: Given the constraints and challenges of the neolithc time period, the answer is likely C: hunt for food, because it is a realistic and likely solution to the problem.\nSo the final answers is C: hunt forfood.\n\nInput: How does a good work ethic help in your professional career?

However, it is mentioned that the person was hungry, suggesting that they didn't have food, thereby making it clear that this cannot be the solution.\n4) Similarly, the person could have gone hunting for food. However, there are already animals present around them, making it difficult for them to hunt.\n5) Similarly, they could also have prayed for food. However, this does not mention if God heard their prayer or not, making it unclear if it is the answer.\n6) The neolithic people could also have grown their own food through farming, as this method of satisfying hunger wouldn't require them to rely on food from animals or God.\n7) Lastly, it is mentioned that they shared what they had, implying that they were in a position to help others. Hence, the answer is likely 6: grow their own food.\n8) To conclude, the neolithic people were able to grow their own food, which helped satisfy their hunger. \n9) This was a solution they could have opted for, making it the most likely answer.\nSo the final solution is 6: grow their  own food.\n\nInput: Who is called a 'pillar of society'?

If we look at the options, we see that \"thank god\" cannot be a possible answer because it does not solve the problem of hunger but rather offers a form of relief or gratitude for it.\n3. Option \"Hunt for food\" is a valid solution to hunger because it involves actively seeking out sources of food.\n4. Option \"Gather food\" is also a valid solution to hungernbecause it involves collecting food from various sources.\n5. Option \"Make food\" is a valid solutiion to hungernbecause it provides a way to create or produce food, allowing for more control over the availability and quality of food.\n6. Option \"Eat\" is a valid soluion to hungernbecause the neolithic person would have to consume the food they gather or hunt.\n7. Therefore we can infer that the correct answer is : \"Make food\".\nSo the final solution is : Make food\n\nInput: What do we usually use to tell time?

{"text": ": create fire D: go to the grocery E: gather food\nOutput: 1 The phrase 'neolithic person' refers to a specific time period and culture, specifically Neolithic Europe, during pre-history. \n2. The neolithic period is known for its agricultural societies and is characterized by the domestication of crops and livestock, the development of tools and technology, and the rise of civilization. \n3. In the context of the question, the answer is likely specific to the Neolithic culture of Europe, which is characterized by a dependence on agriculture and domestic animals for food sources. The question provides an indication of the 'prblem', which could be interpreted as either a lack of food resources or difficulty in accessing those resources. This would indicate that the answer is most likely to be E: gather food, as this could be the most logical solution to a problem related to a lack of food resources.\n4. The other options A, B, C, and D do not seem to align specifically to the context of the Neolithic period and would be less likely to be the solution to a problem related specifically to a lack of food.\n\n## How to run all Python and all Julia tests\n\n1.

It talks about a neolithic person, presumably someone who lived during a specific era of human history called neolithic.\n2. Since the question asks what the neolithic person did in order to find food, it's clear they wouldn't be turning to prayer or other types of religious solutions, making options A and B incorrect.\n3. While hunt for food could be possible, it isn't likely given the context and the other options available.\n4. The same can be said about option D. Farming was actually something that would become more widespread during and after the neolithic age, making is incorrect, as mentioned in the next steps.\n5. What does remain is cooking and eating dirt.  Both options seem odd, but can be valid given the context.\n6. Eating dirt is unlikely, but not necessarily unheard of and unlikely to be impossible during this time period.\n7. Therefore option E looks more plausible than other options.\n8.

{"text": ": kill for food D: share for food E: starve to Death\nOutput: 1.\u201cThe solution is always found when one has the patience and takes the time. If one is patient and takes the time, one discovers exactly what the problem is, and then the solution is found, and that\u2019s just a matter of applying it.\u201d\n2. The question seems to be asking about the neolithic person's attitude towards food and their solution to the problem of not having enough.\n3. From the question, we know that the person was hungry, but also that they had the attitude that they should \u201chunt for food\u201d instead of searching for other solutions.\n4. One of the solutions that the neolithic hunter-gatherer could have used, in place of hunting for food, would have been to \u2018shar[e] for food\u2019.\n5. \u2018Sharing for food\u2019 implies a communal attitude where the person could work together with others to obtain food in a more collaborative fashion.\n6. Another solution the neolithic could have used in the face of hunger would be to \u2018starve \u2018to death\u2019.\n7. This would be a final resort after all other options had been exhausted, but it could be a solution provided to those who don\u2019t have the resources or will to attempt other possibilities.\n8. Therefore, from the given options, the most suitable choice would be to \u2018star[ve to] death\u2018.\nSo the final answers is E: starve to death\n\nInput: The person who loves to write has to practice writing everyday.

{"text": ": find a job D: buy a restaurant E: go fishing\nOutput: 1- The question poses that the neolithic person, or early human, was hungry and faced a problem in finding food.\n2. From the question, we can identify several things about the neolithic period: firstly, that the person is living in one of the first settlements (neolithic means newstone); secondly, that the person was likely working as a hunter-gatherer and may have been struggling to find enough food for themselves and their family.\n3. This leads us to the problem: the neolithic figure is hungry and has no means of acquiring enough basic calorie items on a daily basis in order to sustain life.\n4. The options presented are all viable solutions for finding food in this situation:\nC: hunt for food -> This is the likely option since it's a form of hunting that the figure would have been performing, albeit not sustainably.\nE: go fishing -> This is a likely option but does not provide enough nutrients for daily survival.\nB: find a job: This is a logical option, but one that would have been unavailable to them as the neolithic hunter-gatherers didn't yet have the means to specialize or create jobs.\nD: buy a restaurant: This is only plausible if the person in question was living in a city with an established food system and has the means to obtain food on demand.\nA: thank god: This option shows a sign of desperation, and also assumes there is a deity in place that can help solve the problem.\n5. Based on the context of the question and the provided options, the most likely solution that the early human would have chosen is C: hunt for food.\n6. This is the best answer as the person was already hunting in order to obtain nutrients, they are therefore searching for prey and not necessarily relying on something outside of themselves for food.\n7. Therefore the answer is C: hunt food.\nSo the final and the correct answer is C: hune food.\n\nInput: I thought about something,  my thoughts changed, I was wrong when I,  I thought about the matter again.

{"text": ": gather food D: cook E: store food\nOutput: The question tells us that the neolithic person, or \"early stone age person\", is hungry.\nWe are given five choices, each suggesting a solution they may have used to satisfy their hunger.\n1. Option A 'thank god', while expressive, does not suggest a course of action for satisfying hunger.\n2. Option B 'hunt for food' could be a valid solution, and is associated with the neolithic period. However, if the early stone age person is hungry, they are probably not equipped to hunt.\n3. Option C 'gather food' would have been a possible way for the early stone age person to get food.\n4. Option D 'cook' is also relevant here, as heating food may have been a necessary step in any food consumption strategy.\n5. Finally, option E'store food' is the most likely option. Hunting and gathering will have provided the early stone age person with food, but cooking was not very common at this time in history.\nTherefore, the most likely solution the early stone age person has for satisfying their hunger is option E'store food'.\nSo the final answer to the neolithic question is E : Store Food\n\n###### Answer\nIt is not logical to believe this question can be answered properly based on these few statements because they lack complete information.\n\nTo be able to understand how two or more objects can be considered equal using arithmetic operations, one needs sufficient information on how their values are compared and whether the information is sufficient or otherwise.\nIn the above question we are told that the expression 92+22=\nThe expression is written with a space between 2 and 2.

This type of language is known as a 'non-definitive statement'. The non-definitive statement does not state with certainty the car driver's drunkenness. There is no definitive word such as 'alcoholist', 'alcohol' or 'drunk'. If the sentence were to use any of these words then it would clearly state whether the car driver was intoxicated or not. Therefore, this sentence is not a definitive statement and is an example of an ambiguous sentence. \nSo the final answer will be, option E: an ambiguous statement.", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": ": go back to the cave D: kill a mammoth E: eat some grass\nOutput: 1) We are given information on the neolithic person's situation (hungry) as well as their solution to the problem (eat some grass). \n2) From the information given, we can deduce the following: \n  - The neolithic man was hungry and sought out an immediate solution.\n  - The solution the neolithic man found was to eat some grass. \n  - We can conclude that the grass eaten was not of substantial nutritional value and thus would not satisfy the neolithic mans' hunger pangs for long. \n3) The options given, though seemingly unrelated, may have been used by neolithic people for the purpose of satisfying their hunger. \n  - An option may seem to be less nutritionally beneficial, but may be more readily available; thus, a person may choose to eat these foods despite their inadequate nutritional qualities. \n  - Similarly, an option could be more nutritionally valuable, but harder to access. \n  - Therefore, based on limited information, we can make a judgement about the validity of the choice provided and whether the neolithic people would have used it. \n  - If the options aren't logically consistent with their context, they can be excluded.\n  - If an option seems logical, it can be included in the list.\n4) After the process of elimination, we find that option 'D' is the most likely solution as it relates to killing and eating a mammoth (a well-known animal of the neolithic period) and also provides the benefit of fulfilling the basic need of hunger.\n5) Therefore, option 'D' is most likely to represent the neolithic persons' solution to their hunger problem.\nSo the final answers is D: kill a mamoth\n\nInput: The world's most advanced computing power is called an AI,  It can  take in  the most sophisticated  of what?

This could be due to a number of reasons, including, low access to food, lack of knowledge about food and agriculture, or even hunger and overeating.\n2. The option A: 'thank god, seems religious and not the right answer.\n3. The options B(hunt for food), C (dig the dirt) and E (gathering grasses) are all potential solutions to the hunger problem that could have been practised by the Neolithic people.\n4. The option D: eating all the food from the previous day seems like an improper solution to the hunger problem and does not fit with the context of the question.\n5. The answer seems to be C: dig the dirds for three reasons: \n\t1. The Neolithic people were the first to use agriculture and domesticated animals, which could have been used to address the hunger problem through the cultivation and domestication of food and animals.\n\t2. This practice of agriculture and domestication was introduced by the Neolithics and was the first step in their journey towards developing their own culture, such as the development of tools and other artifacts.\n\t3. The option C: to dig the Dirt indicates that the Neolithic were the first agriculturalists and domesticators and were able to address the hunger problems using such methods.\n6. Therefore, the answer seems to be C.\nSo the finals answer is C: dig the dirst for three reason\n\nInput: Sam was a man with extraordinary skills.  He never made a mistake, why did he? Choices:  I.

The question aims to explain the primary source of food that was available to people during this time.\n3. The options represent possible solutions given by the Neolithic person to their hunger, but only one would be most likely to have been employed.\n4. Option A could refer to God providing food through prayer, but this would have not been a feasible solution for the Neolithic people as they did not have the resources or technology to pray for or receive food from God directly.\n5. Option C could refer to the Neolith people praying for food; however, this would also be an inappropriate answer as praying is not considered a method of obtaining food.\n6. Option D could be a correct answer, as it refers to farming and cultivating crops, which was a common practice during this time and provided a reliable source of food for the Neolith people.\n7. However, option E is the most valid solution, as it refers directly to growing food and provides a reliable source of food that could be obtained on a consistent basis.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question would be E: grow their own crops.\nSo the final answers is E: grow their own crop\n\nInput: An athlete was given a drug boost, but he wanted to what anyway.

The word \"boost\" refers to an increase in performance, usually through the use of drugs or other external means.\n3). The question asks about the \"anyway\" after they were given the drug boost, which implies that the athlete's main focus was to improve their performance in some way.\n4).

{"text": ": be happy D: take a walk E: eat meat\nOutput: 1: Reading the question, we can see that a Neolithic person was going to eat meat. The word'solution' implies that the Neolithic person had a method to fulfill their desire of eating meat.\n2. Reading through the solutions provided and analysing the context of the question, we can understand that they ate meat and were happy. They were unable to thank God, or take a walk because the solution was eating meat.\n3. Looking at the solutions given we can easily eliminate option'A: Thank God', as one cannot thank God for the fulfillment of their needs.\n4. We can eliminate option 'B: Hunt for food', as although the neolithic times might have found the idea of hunting for food exciting, it does not give a solution to how to feed oneself.\n5. We can eliminate option'D: Take a walk', as a solution cannot be to 'take a stroll' for pleasure. 6. Now we are left with 2 options, which are\n7. Eating meat: this gives the desired outcome of having something to eat, and we can understand that this is likely a 'happy' outcome.\n8. The other solution, which is 'be happy' is unlikely to be a possible solution unless 'being happy' is to 'eat something'.\n9. Therefore, to conclude, the most likely outcome to eating meat would be happiness.\n10. The solution 'eat meat' has a better chance of giving them happiness, as opposed to 'be happy'.\n11. Therefore the answer choice is likely to be E 'eat meat' as the most likely solution to eat meat and also fulfillment of feeling happy.\nSo the final answers is  E: eat meat\n\nInput: Your spouse has a good idea,  a better one than what?

{"text": ": find a tree D: look for what?\nOutput: 1) The neolithic people are hungry, so they need to find food.\n2. The word \"So\" indicates that hunger is a problem they have solved.\n3. The options available are: \"hunt for food\" \"find a tree\" \"look for what?\" and \"thank god\"\n4. The neolithic period is defined by a reliance on hunting and gathering agriculture, so it seems reasonable that the person would find food by hunting.\n5. The option \"look for what?\" seems to suggest that they lack a basic knowledge or familiarity with their environment, or perhaps are having difficulty finding enough food to satisfy their hunger.\n6. The option \"thank god\" is an unsatisfactory solution to this problem, as it does not address the underlying reasons for hunger or provide a sustainable method of obtaining food.\n7. Therefore we can eliminate \"thank god\" and \"look for what?\" from consideration.\n8. The remaining options are: \"Hunt for food\" and \"find a tree\"\n9. These options both provide potential ways that the Neolithic people might have addressed their hunger. This makes them both logical possibilities and we must evaluate them against the fact that \"The neolithic person is hungry, so their solution to the problem is...\"\n10. The option \"Hunt for food,\" fits the context of the problem as well the question as to what their solution is.\n11. The option \"Find a tree\" does not seem to directly address the issue of hunger and seems to suggest that the individual might have gone out and found food or shelter from the elements in a tree that was located in their environment.\n12. Therefore, the answer appears to be \"hunt for food\".\nSo the final solution is hunt for food\n\nInput: Everyone has a natural birthright which is what?

{"text": ": hunt and gather D: dig a well E: grow food\nOutput: 1: The key aspect of the question is that the \"neolithic\" person is facing the issue of being hungry.\n2. Given this understanding, it's important to contextualize the options given. These options represent specific ways of acquiring food and acquiring sustenance in general.\n3. Option A 'thank god' is an extreme exaggeration that does not logically represent how a real person might have handled finding themselves hungry and needing food.\n4. Option B 'hunt for food' is also an outdated expression as well as a way of acquiring food that is likely to be unavailable in today's society.\n5. Option C 'hunt and gather' is a method of acquiring food, but requires significant resources such as space, time, and effort, which would not be suitable for a hungry person.\n6. Option D 'dig a well' is also a way of acquiring water, but does not necessarily address the issue of hunger specifically, as it does not provide food itself.\n7. Option D expresses the \"neolithal\" person's solution to the problem of hunger. The acquisition of food can be achieved through the act of \"growing food\".\n8. Option E does not express a solution to the issue of hunger. The option describes a general way of providing food, which is not specific to being able to satisfy hunger.\n9. Therefore based on the reasoning, we can conclude that the correct answer is option: Grow food.\nSo the final is E: grow food\n\nInput: It is not difficult to see why the first emperor had a lot of bureaucrats; it was what he called the what?

{"text": ": cultivate food D: harvest E: make tools\nOutput: 1.\" The neolithic people were hungry so what was their solution is a question that asks what steps or strategies the Neolithic people took to ensure they were adequately fed.\n2. The answer to this question is best understood by analyzing the available options given.\n3. The answer \"a\" is not correct as it is not mentioned in the context that the Neolithic person thanked God or prayed for food.\n4. The option \"B\" is also incorrect as it does not refer to a method used by the Neolithic peoples, but to \"hunting for food\" which is something that has been done by people in various eras and is not specific to the Neolithic period.\n5. Option \"C\" could be related to cultivating food, however, this was something that the Neolithics had not done initially and later. So this is not a suitable way for the Neolithic to solve the problem of food shortage.\n6. Option \"D\" is related to harvesting crops or grains, which is a later step in the process of growing food. So again, this is not a suitable strategy to solve the problem of a chronic shortage of food.\n7. Option \"E\" is also incorrect as the option refers to a tool used to catch animals, which is not directly related to solving the food problem faced by the Neolithics. It may have been used as a tool to hunt animals or to catch fish, which did not necessarily provide long-term food security.\n8. We can thus eliminate  the earlier options, leaving the one that is the answer to the question: \"D: harvesting\".\n9. Option \"D\" refers to \"harvesting\" which implies the retrieval or collection of crops or food after they have been planted, allowing for a longer period of supply.\n10. Therefore, the answer to the question \"The neolithic person (was) hungry, so what (was) (their) solution to the problem?' is D: harvesting.\nSo the final  answer is D: harvest.\n\nInput: Lori needs to go to the gym.

{"text": ": grow their own food D: build a farm\nOutput: 1 The question talks about a neolithic person who was hungry and had to find a solution to this problem.\n2. The options mention the ways of solving the problem of hunger, which were eating wild game, cultivation of crops, and owning livestock.\n3. If one were to consider A (thank god), it's implied that the person has little control over their situation, and a dependence on luck for survival. So, it can be excluded.\n4. Option B (hunt for food) also seems to be out of the scope of the choices, as the neolithic period was before the advent of hunted food.\n5. Looking at Choices C and D, if the answer is C (grow their own food), it implies the person can access land to cultivate crops. But if the choice is D (own livestock), it implies the person has land for cultivation.\n6. Thus both C (grow their food) and D (build a farm) can be taken into consideration. The question is implying that the person would grow their own food or build their own farm.\n7. Finally, we need to understand what it means to \"build a farm\" in the context of the question and available options.\n8. We can see from the options that building a farm means owning livestock and cultivating crops.\n9. In short, the meaning of creating a farm can be expressed in terms of cultivating crops and owning livestract. So, the best answer based on this interpretation is D: own livestock and cultivate crops.\nSo the final solution is D: build a farm.", "answer": " 400"}
{"text": ": build a fire D: find some shade E: boil water\nOutput: 1 In the absence of food sources, a neolithic person would likely be forced to hunt for food.\n2 In order to boil water, a neolithical person would need to start a fire and use the fire to boil water.\n3 Boiling water is a common practice for preserving food and water, but is also used in cooking and preparing various food items.\n4 In order to build a fire, a neolithcial person would need to gather some wood and other ignitable materials, and use them to start a fire.\n5 A person's solution to the food problem would likely be to hunt for food or boil water, as boiling water is a common method for preserving food and cooking.\n6 Given all the reasoning and conclusions, an appropriate answer for this question is most likely to be D: build a fire, as building a fire is a common method used to build and boil water by neolithic people.\nSo the final the the answer is D: build a fire\n\nInput: Ancient Egyptians believed that everything in the universe was made of what? Choices A: ether B: air C: water D: fire E: earth\nOutput: 1 The options A, B, and C all refer to elements found in the physical environment, as opposed to E which refers to the earth.\n2. Therefore, the correct answer to this question is D: fire.\nSo the final answeer is D: fire\n\nInput: They have the biggest mouths in the animal kingdom.  A shark can not fit what inside its huge mouth? Choices: 1. The whole seal B: its stomach C: its whole body D: its jaws E: nothing\nOutput: 1 \"The biggest mouths in the kingdom\" is a statement that describes the capacity for the mouths of sharks to hold large prey items, thus making them one of the largest living animals with respect to mouth size.\n2. From this information, we can infer that sharks can easily consume large prey.\n3. When it comes to mouth size in relation to a shark's body size, nothing could possibly fit inside an animal with a mouth that is proportionally bigger than the animal's body.\n4. This eliminates", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": ": gather food D: store food E: eat dirt\nOutput: 1. The neolithic man is presented as the one who is hungry.\n2. The question is focused on identifying the solution they employed to address the problem.\n3. So the options can be grouped into two: The ones that involve hunting for food, and the rest that involve gathering or storing food.\n4. Option A 'thank god' doesn't seem to have anything to do with food.\n5. Option'B 'hunt for food' refers to the specific action of searching for food in its natural environment.\n6. Option'C 'gather food' refers to the collecting of food items from the environment, without necessarily being tied to specific action.\n7. Option D'store food' refers to holding a supply of collected food for future use.\n8. Now the last option E 'eat dirt', seems to be the most absurd answer, since it not an effective solution to the problem of hunger.\n9. So in conclusion, based on the given context and options, the correct answer is C: gather food.\nSo the final solution is C: gather food\n\nInput: When you go on-line and look for something do you use any particular search engine? Choices:  Yes No A B C Google Yahoo Bing \nOutput: 1: The question is about searching for something online which can be done using any search engine.\n2. The options mention the following search engines: Google, Yahoo, Bing so we can rule them out as they already do exists.\n3. The first option is either yes(i.e. the user will look or search for something to purchase on-line) or no(i.e.the user will simply explore or visit the site without looking for something).\n4. Option A: Yes, the user will look for a product to buy online, but the question doesn't mention buying online, it just mentions using search engines. \n5. Option B: No(not looking for anything), but again the question doesn't really ask the user to not look for anything but rather to use search engines. \n6. We cannot eliminate option C: Google, because all search engines exists and it's not mentioning if the user will use any, but only which one will they use.\n7. Option B:", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": ": make fire D: work the land E: pray\nOutput: 1 The question sets up a scenario in which a neolithic person is hungry. The question then asks about the solution they use.\n2. The options offered are divided into two general categories: solutions based on the physical or material resources available (the choices \"Hunt for food\", \"Work the land\", and \"Pray\") and solutions that are non-material or mental (the choice \"Thank God\"). \n3. The latter option, \"Pray\", also falls under the category of physical or material resources. Thus, it can be excluded from the latter group.\n4. The physical or material resources available during the Neolithic era would have included hunting wild game, farming, and gathering wild plants.\n5. However, the situation of having nothing to eat implies being lost or stranded, rather than being at home or in the wild. Therefore, it is more plausible that the neolithic person would have not been able to hunt or farm.\n6. This leaves us with just two choices that fall under the category of \"the mental\" of the material ones. \"Hunt for food\" and \"Work the land\" are both solutions based on physical or material resources, \n7. So what remains are the options for the mental or non-material response.\n8. These remaining two options are \"Thank God\" and \"Make fire\".\n9. \"Thank God\" could potentially be an emotional response to being unable to find food. A person might attribute their predicament to divine providence or to fate, and thus express gratitude for not having to go hungry.\n10. However, this would be a short-term solution, since if the person's circumstances did not change from being lost, then their emotions would not be able to supply long-term sustenance.\n11. On the other hand, the option to \"Make fire\" would make the person less dependent on their circumstances and weather-related factors, since fire provides a source of warmth and light.\n12. With the fire, the hunter could stay warm and cook their food. Even if it did not end up filling up the hungry person, it would at least offer them some warmth and protection.\n13. The option of \"make fire\", being a non-material solution, is more relevant to", "answer": " 106000"}

The choices given are:  \"Thank God\" - This does not provide a clear solution to a famine, as it doesn't indicate what the person will be doing to address the famine.\n4. \"Hunt for food\" - This could be a solution in this context, as the person could be gathering plant materials/animal for foods.\n5. \"Gather what they can\" - This can also be seen as a solution to a famines in this context, as it implies the person may be trying to collect food or resources from the surrounding environment.\n6. \"Leave\" - This does not make sense in this context, as leaving in search of food would not resolve the issue of the person being famished.\n7. Based on the provided choices, the answer could be either C or A.\n8. The answer is A: thank god, as this provides a solution to the hypothetical scenario by indicating that the neolithic person is thanking their god for providing them with food.\nSo the final answers is A: thank god\n\nInput: The president of this country  isn't very popular, the citizens are angry that he took the money from where it belongs.

Based upon our assumptions of their being hunter-gatheres: To hunt for their food, they'make a shelter' or 'light a fire'.\n4. Thus, these options make most sense in this context.\n5. The options are A, C, and D.\n6. Option A can be eliminated because it is not the most logical choice - they likely didn't 'thank god', they were too hungry or cold to think of such things.\n7. Option B can be ruled out as well because there was already a'solution to the problem' of their hunger which was to hunt for food.\n8.

{"text": ": gather food D: invent farming E: none of the above\nOutput: 1. The question refers to a neolithic (the first Stone Age) hunter-gatherer in the context of being hungry.\n2. Based on the context, the answer should be about how they hunted or gathered food.\n3. Options A 'thank god' and B 'hunt for food' seems like reasonable solutions, however, they're indirect.\n4. Options C and D both indicate inventing some type of agriculture/ farming. \n5. Looking back to the context, the question doesn't necessarily state a specific mode of food-hunting, which leads us to options B and D as possible answers.\n6. Even if you were to assume that the only solution to the problem was farming, option D is an over-elaborate choice as it provides extensive details with little relevance to the question.\n7. Finally, option E 'none of the above', is a reasonable deduction based on the context, but it doesn'T directly capture the essence of the problem, that is - a neolithic person hunter-gathering.\n8. Therefore, we can narrow down the options to two choices D: invent farming and E: none of the answer. \n9. The answer here is very subjective, and it can be argued that both farming and gathering food is reasonable approaches in different settings. \n10. But since farming takes a longer time, it is more likely to be the correct answer. \n11. Also, since farming is a major part of our economy worldwide today, it is more relevant to this context, and hence, it is more likely that the correct answer would be \"D: invent farming.\"\nSo the final answer becomes D: invent farming.\n\nInput: Everyone must have at least one of which?

This is because options like cooking food, building fires or gathering food are possible answers, but they don't necessarily solve the problem of being hungry.\n4- The specific solution is therefore option D, which is to gather food, because it's a solution that helps neolithic people eat, solve the problem of their hunger, and it's a more general answer that covers all of the possible situations faced by the neolithic person.\n5- As such, the correct answer is option D: \"gather food.\"\n\nInput: There are no 9 in the last 30 digits of the following number.\nChoices:  A:834573\nB:876543\nC:886543\nD:658034\nOutput: 1- The problem is stated using a pattern that has been followed before.

But what the neolithic person needed was food, not fish or animal meat.\n7. Therefore the correct answer has to be one from the remaining three options.\n8. Choice D 'Use technology' doesn't make sense because hunters at that time would have relied on natural resources, not technology.\n9. Choice E 'Catch' involves harvesting fish or animal meat. \n10.

Option B \"Hunt for food\" is also not a specific solution, as it just describes the process of hunting.\n5. Option C \"Go to a nearby village\" has the potential to be a solution, but it does not explain the specific issue faced by the specific person.\n6. Option D \"Gather wild plants\" is a type of solution that could be appropriate for a specific individual's circumstances.\n7. Option D \"Catch fish\" is also relevant as a specific solution.\n8. The question does not specify which option is the correct answer, so we should use logic to determine the most likely solution that is mentioned in the question.\n9. The context of the problem suggests that the solution provided is something to do food, such as hunting, gathering wild plants, or catching fish.\n10. The solution is also likely to be a solution related to the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of Neolithic tribes.\n11. Based on these considerations, the most likely solution that can be inferred from the question is Option D: \"gathering wild plants.\"\n12. Therefore, that is the final answer.\nSo the final option is D: Gathering Wild Plants\nThis makes sense because in such olden times they would have needed something to eat and they would have hunted and killed animals to eat, but then they would be required to go back to their village due to some problem, this could be due to a fight by some local villager or some other problem and when they would be back after 2 or 3 days after killing an animal,that food would have gone bad and it was impossible to keep it cold there and they would have had to hunt for an animal again.

So, it doesn't fit as a community-based solution to the problem.\n5: Option C involves cooking as a solution to the problem, but it does not suggest if the solution was effective or successful as cooking is not always an immediate solution to hunger.\n6: Option D involves collecting which can result in food but it's not guaranteed, so it's not a guaranteed solution to the problem of hunger.\n7: Option E involves growing food, which is a reliable way to provide food for a group of people and to address the problem of hungers of the Neolithic people. \n8: Therefore, the answer is B: Hunt for food.\nSo the final solution is B: Hunt\n\nInput: In an art museum, what was the artist thinking as she painted her best work?

Hungry people often look for food or drinks, and the neolithic people may have done so as well. \n3. Options A, B, and D all speak about finding food or water, which is a plausible solution.\n4. However, the question mentions only plants or animals as food options, and finding \"new\" food or water may involve hunting. \n5. To find new food, hunting would be the most likely option.\n6. Therefore, option D is the most likely correct option.\nSo the final  answer is D: find new food.\n\nInput: How did the monarchy of Great Britain lose its power around the late 1700s? Choices: 1. A: It didn't have what it needed to maintain power. 2 B: The government overthrew it. C: It lost popular support. 3. D: The King took over a lot of the government itself. 4 E: People voted not to continue the monarchy.\nOutput: 1) We can see that the King had absolute power, and his actions could create a crisis.\n2) The Monarchy, even with absolute power, might not be able to control everything.\n3) The King may not want to control everything personally.\n4) If the monarch lost power, they will have to take control over themselves, and people may not want to continue.\n5) Therefore, both options 1 and 4 are unlikely. \n6) It is likely that the government would replace the monarchy itself.\n7) If King takes over some of the government, the monarch may not have absolute control, people may not vote to continue, and the government may not replace the monarch.\n8) Therefore, the answer is C.\n\nSo the final  answe is C: 2.

'Thank god' is not a solution to the food problem; \n5) Solution B states that they hunted for food, which could perhaps be a solution to a food problem, but it is unclear whether it is a solution to their current problem of being hungry. \n6) Solution C states that they pray.  Praying does not solve their food problem. \n7) Solution D is to grow crops. Growing crops would take time and could potentially provide a long term solution to their food problem, but it would not help in the moment when their are hungry. \n8) Solution E is to pick berries. This is a form of hunting and could potentially solve the food problem in the moment; thus, this is a likely solution. \n9) Therefore, the answer is more likely to be E: pick berries.\nSo the final solution would be E: pick beris\n\nInput: His mood is dark, gloomy, somber, cheerless.

{"text": ": search for food D: farm E: invent a tool\nOutput: 1) Firstly, 'The neolithic person' is the subject of the question and by this implication is considered to be a person who is currently in need of food.\n2) The question then proceeds to give a description of the environment in which this person lives and works, specifically mentioning that this was a time in our history when people had to hunt for food before they could farm for it.\n3) The question, then, would not be asking us to 'find a way to hunt for food' because the neolithic person is already trying! Instead, it asks what new tool this person invents to help them hunt.\n4. Looking through the options, option A is a bit misleading as it assumes God has somehow intervened and 'taken care of the problem' for no other reason than for this to happen. As such, it cannot be the correct solution.\n5. The other options don't describe any tools, but they would each describe a suitable and realistic response to this problem. Option B could be for hunting food, but this still doesn't answer the question of what is done when there is no food (hunt for the food or give up and move to the next stage!)\n6. Option C could be in response to the person being hungry, but it would not directly help the situation. Similarly, option A could be true, but it doesn'tcannot be immediately apparent. Instead, we need to know what they do next in order to determine what they think is appropriate.\n7. The question is not asking the person's opinion, but what the'solution' would be from their perspective.\n8. Option E could describe a tool used for hunting, so it is somewhat viable, but it also mentions a tool used to farm, which was not an option in the question. Therefore, while this option is plausible, no definitive answer can be made as to which of these options is the best answer.\n9. Therefore it's not possible to definitively select a single answer, but we can rule out option B as that would assume the hunt is successful every time, which it would not be. For the other three options, there is at least some plausible description of the solution but we cannot determine which of them is best.\n10. We can eliminate option", "answer": " 600"}

Based on the context and previous information, we can deduce the answer is probably in the positive options.\n5.)  Option A \"thank god\" is not a likely solution as it is not directly related to the problem of hungering which requires action.\n6.)  Option B \"hunt for food\" is a possible solution and is likely to be the correct answer. However option C \"ask another person for help\" can also be a correct answer, as the neolithic people's primary mode of communication was probably through oral traditions.\n7.)  Finally, option D \"help themselves and hope to find some food\" is a plausible solution if they were close to finding some crops or food and hoping for the best.\n8.)

Choices:  a: carnivore B: herbivore C: omnivore D: frugivore E: ferocious\nOutput: 1: \"An organism feeds on\" means that the organism is classified as a consumer. A consumer has to feed on other organisms to get the food they need.\n2: The term \"living things\" means that the organisms being consumed are alive, which means the consumer is not classified as a carnivore (who consumes animals) but rather classified as an animal that eats \"plant material\".\n3: The four choices given for foodies are herbivores, omnivores, frugivores and ferocious.\n4: Herbivores and plants material are the same (both are plants). \"Herbivores\" are not carnivores, but consumers of plants that are alive. Thus Herbivores are animals that eat plant material.\n5: The same reasoning applies to omnivores, who are animals that eat plant and animal material.\n6: Fruits, as food items, are plant material and thus frugivores are animals that feed on and eat plant material.\n7: Hence, the only option left is frugivores.\n8: The organisms being consumed by frugivores are alive and thus frugivore is the correct choice.\nSo the final anwser is C: Frugivores\n\nInput: A shark is a dangerous wild animal, however, a shark also has something that some other animal has", "answer": " 584"}

The given options provide four possible solutions to the problem:\n  a: \"thank god\" b: \"hunt for food\" c: \"gather and dry food\" d: \"go to town for food\"\n  e: \"make the food\"\n3. a and b are clearly inappropriate, as they assume that \"god\" or hunting will solve the problem of hunger. Thus, they can be discarded.\n4. c and d suggest gathering food and making it either fresh or dried.\n5. e suggests actually cooking, rather than gathering food.\n6. There are two different outcomes of the problem (solving hunger and cooking the food), so the solutions should be distinguished accordingly.\n7. \"thank god\" does not solve the hunger problem: it just expresses gratitude or praise and does not provide actual food, so it can be discarded. \n8. \"hunting for food\" would not necessarily resolve the problem of hunger, as hunting results may be unpredictable and could provide less or no food at all. Thus it can be discarded as well\n9. The outcomes can be analyzed in the form of a hypothesis \"A solution to the problem of hunger is'making the food'\" and its negation \"making the food is not a solution to the problem of being hungry.\"\n10. A solution can be defined as providing a solution to the problem, but making the food does not necessarily do this.\n11. For a solution to be viable, it should at least provide food.\n12. Since we know that being hungry is equivalent to being without food, we must also presume that making the food is not a food item and will therefore not prevent hunger.\n13. Thus, we can conclude that option E \"make the food\" does not meet the definition of a solution in this context and can be discarded. This means that \"thank god\" and \"hunting for the food\" are our only viable options.\n14. Option D is clearly the viable solution, as it solves the problem of hunger by", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": ": plant a garden D: invent farming E: invent pasta\nOutput: 1 A: God has nothing to do with people's hunger or lack thereof. Thanking God would not solve the issue, and this answer seems out of place in the context.\n2. Option B: Hunt for food refers to seeking food in the form of wild game, which may or may not solve the problem. It could lead to the individual finding the necessary resources, but it does not necessarily take care of the issue completely.\n3. Option C: Plant a garden is a possible solution to hunger and lack of food resources, as it allows people to cultivate their own produce. This is a solution that a Neolithic society can employ. A Neolithic society is one that is primarily based on agriculture and animal husbandry rather than hunting and gathering.\n4. Option D: Invent farming is a potential solution to food scarcity, and one that would be familiar to the Neolithic society. This option encompasses not just farming but also animal husbandry, which would further address the scarcity of food and the needs of the people.\n5. Option E: Invented pasta, while certainly a solution to food scarcity and lack of resources, does not necessarily work for the Neolithic time period as pasta was invented much later. This option, while relevant, is not applicable to the Neoliths.\n6.

{"text": ": prayed D: starved E: gathered food\nOutput: 1.'The Neolithic period'is the epoch of the Stone Age when mankind's primary focus was on hunting for food.\n2.  The context suggests that the Neolithic period is still relevant and relevant in contemporary times.\n3. Options A and B seem like statements of faith, which are not realistic solutions to finding and accessing food because it requires effort and energy that can be better applied elsewhere.\n4. Option D seems the most plausible option, considering the context and the focus on hunting for food in the Neolithic Period.\n5. The solution of gathering, hunting, or finding food could potentially be more practical than relying on prayer or a higher being that might not answer prayers in a timely manner.\n6. We can then conclude that the correct answer is E: gathered food.\nSo the final answers is E: gathered food\n\nInput:  In the second year of his rehabilitation, what did Tom say he had learned to avoid? What made it hard to say no? Choices:  C: stress A: fatigue - - - no - - -\nOutput: 1.\u201dThe second year of his rehab\u201d is mentioned in this context and it\u2019s likely to be the second year of treatment, therapy or recuperation after being injured or recovering from an illness.\n2. \u201crehabilitation\u201d typically refers to the rebuilding or reorganization of an individual\u2019s life after their health has been compromised due to injury or illness.\n3. \u201cTom\u201d is likely to be the subject of the story and we know from the context that he has been recuperating for two years.\n4. Looking carefully for the context, we can infer that what Tom has learned is to avoid stress in his everyday life to prevent fatigue. This makes sense since recovering from injury or illness can be stressful.\n5. Option \u2018C: stress\u201d is the only obvious answer that appears to fit in the context.\n6. The phrase \u201cwhat made it hard to say \u2018no\u2019\u201d can be understood as referring to the difficulty Tom faced in adhering to his new avoidance of stress and fatigue.\n\nInput: The best time to weed your garden is when it's what?

{"text": ": gather plants D: find animal droppings E: find animal trails\nOutput: 1) The question asks us to identify the solution the neolithic person took to overcome their hunger.\n2) The question implies that the hungry person was a member of the neolithic era, and that they were successful in getting food to eat. \n3) Therefore, the given solution must be an approach or strategy that the hungry person employed to overcome their hunger and obtain food to eat.\n4) Looking at the options: Thank God is not necessarily a solution, but more of a hope for a solution to the hunger; Hunt is an action, though it's not necessarily a solution; Gather plants implies that the option is not based on hunting, which makes it a possible solution; Find animal droppings could be an approach to hunting animals to get food, which can be considered a solution; Find animal trails is a strategic approach to finding certain animals and getting food by hunting them/finding their trails & following it.\n5) However, find animal trails could lead to hunting or gathering plants. \n6) Since the given options both involve hunting and gathering plants, we can further infer that the answer is likely to involve animal hunting or plant gathering, and not animal dropping or trail following. \n7) Therefore, looking at the options mentioned above, the answer is likely D: find animal dropping.\n8) However, it's not explicitly mentioned in the sentence that the droppings are being searched for to actually find some food to eat.  Thus, we may not be certain that the answer is 'D', however it's a probable and logical approach or solution to the problem.\nSo the final is C: find animal dropping\n\nInput: Who was John's wife in the book \"Mice and people\" by John Steinbeck\nOutput: 1st: This question is about a book, so it's about the context. \n2nd: The author is \"John Steinbeck\" so it's more about his writing rather than actual people. Also, the mention of \"mice\" and \"people\" seems to be an indication of animals and humans\n3rd: It seems like the answer might be about someone that doesn't actually exist or it's a work of fiction\n4th: Based on this, the answer may not be", "answer": " 1979"}
{"text": ": eat candy D: starve to death E: create fire\nOutput: 1: The question provides information about the neolithic person. They were described as hungry and faced a problem of not having enough food.\n2: Based on the description of the Neolithic person and the problem they faced, it is clear that the correct answer must be an answer that describes a way to solve the problem of not having enough to eat. The options given are: Thank God, Hunt, Create a Fire, and Starve to death.\n3: Of these options, thanking God does not make sense as it is out of the Neolithics control how much food they are going to have, they can also thank God for the food they have.\n4: Eating candy doesn\u2019t really make sense because it has no relation to being hungry and in the context of the question, candy is a non food item.\n5: Starving to death is not a solution, so it can be ruled out. \n6: Lastly, Hunt indicates that they create a fire, so the correct answer is B: Hunt for Food.\nSo the final word is B: Hunt\n\nInput: For the best sardine fishing how do you bait the hook? Choices: 0.0000: A: Use a worm 0.003: B: Use a squid 0.007: C: Use a fish 0.999: D: Use a sardine 0.997: E: Use no bait\nOutput: 1) We are provided with a scenario where the goal is to catch a lot of fish, so the answer will need to focus on a strategy or action that will effectively bring about more fish.\n2) There are two choices, B and D, that both suggest using different forms of bait. \n3) Option B seems to be more specific in offering an eating option for the target fish (squid) which could be a helpful strategy to catch more fish. \n4) Similarly, Option D mentions the use of the target fish (sardine) as bait, which may work well for catching the target fish.\n5) Therefore, the correct answer is B, which uses a squid as bait.\nSo the final solution is B: Use a squd", "answer": " 123"}
{"text": ": find vegetation D: catch insects E: look over edge\nOutput: Consideration:\n1. The question asks about a solution to a problem faced by a hypothetical \"neolithic person\".\n2. The description given of the neolithic person suggests that they were \"hungry\" and \"looking over the edge\" to solve the problem.\n3. The term \"solution\" in the question implies that there is another option besides \"looking over the edge\", hence it is reasonable to exclude choices \"thank god\" and \"find vegetation\".\n4. The choice \"catch insects\" seems illogical, since it doesn't necessarily provide a solution to the problem of hunger.\n5. Choice \"hunt for food\" doesn't necessarily point to one specific method of obtaining food or solving the problem of hunger, but seems to imply that finding food should be attempted through multiple modes.\n6. Choice \"look over edge\" is a plausible solution to the problem of being hungry, since it indicates the possibility of finding food by looking over the edge of the ledge.\n7. Therefore the answer is E: look over edge.", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": ": pray to god D: do some work E: ask for help\nOutput: 1) The word \"hungry\" in the sentence suggests that the individual was experiencing a need for food, not for spiritual or emotional fulfillment.\n2) Based on this, the likely answer would be: \"B: Hunt for food\"\n3. Hunting implies using physical strength, skill, and knowledge to find food in its natural habitat.\n4. This suggests choosing an option related to finding and acquiring food.\n5) Option A \"thank god\" seems less likely as it is a form of gratitude directed towards a higher power or deity, rather than the need to find a solution to a physical problem.\n6) Option B \"Pray to god\" could be an option if the person believed that their prayers would result in their food requirements being met, but this isn't necessarily something that an individual would typically do in a situation where their physical needs are being met.\n7) Option C \"Do some work\" requires physical action and effort, but doesn't necessarily entail looking for food sources.\n8) Option D \"ask for help\" implies seeking the support or assistance of other individuals in finding food, but doesn't directly address the individual's physical needs.\n9) Option E \"Eat some cookies\" is an irrelevant option given that the person was hungry, not experiencing a need for emotional satisfaction.\n10) Therefore, from the available options the answer is C.\nSo the final Answer is C: Pray to god\n\nInput: He's not happy, but he's still cheerful;  He was on the basketball game where his team, the home team, what the what? Choices: A: won B: lost C: tie D: won't lose E: play a tie game\nOutput: 1.) The sentence starts with a reference to someone not being happy but still being cheerful.\n2.) As a team, you would usually want to win a basketball game.\n3.) Since the team is cheerful, it likely means that the team lost the game.\n4.) Since the home team is the team that\u2019s playing (and not the other team), the sentence uses \u201cwon the game\u201d rather than \u201clost the game.\u201d\n5.) Since an outcome of the game is known\u2014they already won or lost\u2014then \u201cplay", "answer": " 113"}
{"text": ": build a restaurant D: cook food E: store food\nOutput: 1) First, it's important to understand the context of the question. It is referring to the early era of civilization, known as the Neolithic Period, and during this time people's solutions were quite different from what we see today.\n2. At this time, people did not have access to the modern technology and amenities that we have today. They relied on traditional methods such as hunting, farming, and gathering for food.\n3. In light of this context, we can rule out options A, B, and E. Option A 'Thank God' is not a logical solution as it did not even exist in this time period. Options B & E 'Hunt for Food' and 'Cook Food' do not accurately reflect the solutions that these people would have used during this time.\n4. The only remaining choice that fits the context of the question is options C 'Build a Restaurant' which would have been a logical solution during this time as civilization gradually developed and people sought to create a stable and efficient source of food.\n5. Therefore we can conclude that the answer is D: Build a restaurant", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": ": discover how to get food from the soil by growing foods D: discover how to get fire from wood\nOutput: 1) The problem is to find food when one is hungry, as indicated by the context \"The neolithic person\".\n2) Based on the given options, hunters can be a potential source of food but, more likely for the neolithic individual who did not have tools at this point of time, the answer would be fire or discovering how to get food from soil by growing foods. \n3) There is no explanation regarding when the food gets exhausted and also the time period, which suggests we look at the choices.\n4) Option C: hunt for food: Hunt does not mean the discovery of food as hunter and hunt both are in the past form. The discovery of food could be done through hunting. \n5) Option D : discover how to get foods from soil by growing food are the correct choice as it also contains the discovery in the process of gaining food sources. The other choice can be eliminated easily. So, the answer would be D: Discover how to get food from Soil by Growing food.\nSo the finalanswer is D: Discover howto get food from Soilby Growing food.", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": ": plant and take what? D: go over the water E: build a boat\nOutput: 1.. The context of the question is clear, suggesting that the neolithic person is hungry and needs to find food.\n2. The options provided do not provide an immediate action that would solve the hunger of the neolithic man, but rather they describe the process by which the person might obtain food.\n3. The options A, D, and E do not provide any direct action to solve the hunger of a person, rather they describe the actions after obtaining food. For instance A \"Thank God\" doesn't provide direct action to obtain food.\n4. Option B \"Hunt for food\" explicitly describes how the person would go about obtaining food. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.\nSo the final option is B: hunting\n\nInput: A cat's meow is a unique sound, which is what? Choices: A: loud B: high pitched C: quiet D: low pitched E: different to a dog bark\nOutput: Option C and option A doesn't make sense.\nOption D is correct from the context of \"A cat's meow unique sound\".\n\nInput: The man was upset because the people at the table were making fun of his lack of manners. Choices: A: etiquette B: taste C: table manners D: grace E: culture\nOutput: Option C, option A, and Option D can be eliminated because \"manners\" and \"etiquette\" means the same thing. Therefore Option B and Option E are right from the context of \"Table manners\"\n\nInput: What can a bird be called where it is rare to see one?

{"text": ": get a job D: kill the wild boar E: dig a hole\nOutput: 1: The first thing to understand is that the neolithic person would not have had a god to thank, as the concept of a higher power or deity did not exist at that time.\n2: After establishing that 'thank god' would not be an acceptable solution, other options need to be evaluated.\n3: Looking at the options, it becomes clear that killing the wild boar was a feasible solution for the neolithic hunter-gatherer.\n4: It was a solution used to fulfill their needs and meet their survival needs, as evidenced by their hunting and gathering activities.\n5: Therefore, it is likely that the neolithichunters would have hunted down and caught the wild boar to satisfy their hunger.\n6: The option 'get a job' is not relevant, as the neolithic era pre-dates the development of agriculture and writing and the concept of 'job' is not applicable at that time.\n7: Similarly, the options 'kill the wild boar', 'dig a hole' and 'hunt for food' are all plausible solutions to the neolithic hunters' hunger.\n8-9: After this process we can arrive at the answer: kill the wild boars.\nSo the final anwser is A: kill the wild boards.\n\nInput: When the new guy joined the office, what was the first thing he had to do?

{"text": ": fish D: get help\nOutput: 1.[...] There are some contextual clues that may be helpful. In the first sentence, the question asks us which Neolithic person and not a \"people\". Neolithic is a period in prehistory that took place from around 10000 BC to around 4000 BC. This was the time when people started to grow crops and breed domestic animals instead of hunting and gathering food. This time was marked by the invention of stone tools, pottery, and polished stone axes.\n2. Based on the above information, we can narrow the options down to A-D. These options can be broken down into two sections: those that involve hunting and gathering food, and those that involve the invention of stone items.\n3. Option A cannot be correct, since we are talking about a Neolithic person, not a \"people\".\n4. Option B cannot be correct either as it does not help solve the problem of hunger.\n5. Option C cannot be correct because it is an activity associated with the Stone Age rather than the Neolithic period.\n6. Option D cannot be correct as it does not involve solving the problem of being hungry.\n7. Therefore in this question from this context it would be likely that the answer would be D: Get help.\nSo the final ans is D: Get help\n\nInput: She bought a new computer.  When asked about what she had done with the old one, she responded she was considering what to do with it, what might she likely be considering?

The context points toward a desire to upgrade to a newer computer.\n3. Based upon the previous purchase it can be determined that the person was likely considering discarding their old computer.\n4. The reason for this conclusion is that computers have a lifespan of about 5 years and as soon as a newer computer is purchased the old one is no longer needed.\n5. It's also worth noting that the person might consider upgrading their", "answer": " 119"}
{"text": ": find a job D: go back to eating grass E: go extinct\nOutput: 1) First, we consider the context of the question. It seems that there are no other options besides the ones listed.\n2) Option A seems impossible as this would be equivalent to a person praising God's for supplying a solution to their hunger problem.\n3) Option B is unlikely as a person did not find a job in order to feed themselves. They simply found a way to acquire food without having to work a job.\n4) Option D is not viable as there is no option that would allow for the person to go back to eating of animals.\n5) Option E is out of the question as a person would not choose death over food; if these two options were both offered, they would likely choose to live.\n6) From the list of possible solutions, the most logical is Option C - find a job.\nSo the final option is C: find a job\n\nInput: He went all around town talking to the people there, what is it that he did? Choices:  a) get b) find c) hire d) employ e) look\nOutput: 1.) The context of the question is clearly evident: the person, presumably a detective, goes all around town talking to people trying to find information about a certain criminal.\n2.) Based on this understanding, it's logical to infer that the choices offered are: get, find, hire, employ, and look.  \n3.) The word \"get\" is ambiguous and can be interpreted in a number of ways that may or may not fit the context of the question; similarly, \"find\" can mean a number of things.\n4.) As for \"hire\", it's likely that he did not ask to hire the individuals he talked to.\n5.) The word \"employ\" can fit the context of the scenario, but does not express the same meaning as \"hire\".\n6.) \"Look\" is not a verb and \"get\" can be understood as a more formal way to express \"find\" in certain situations.\n7.) As such, it's logical that the answer is \"find\".\nSo the final option to choose from is B: find\n\nInput: How can I get around London on a budget?

{"text": ": pray D: search for fire E: find shelter\nOutput: 1) It is clear that the neolithic person is \"hungry\" because they have a problem that needs to be solved.\n2) The following options are based on ancient history:\n  A): Hunting for food, as a primary means of gathering food was the solution in a pre-agricultural society(Neolithic and hunter gather-eclipting were two ancient societies that lived in these pre-agricultrial conditions. Thus, it is a viable solution)\n  B): Prayer\n  C): Searching for fire: The neolithics needed fire for cooking food; they could obtain fire by lightning, from dry wood, from using a hand drill, etc.  Therefore, it is a valid solution.\n  D): Having shelter- A shelter is meant to protect against the rain and cold.\n3) As it turns out, only three solutions are related to the core problem. Therefore, we can eliminate \"search for fire\" and \"shelter\" from the options.\nSo the final solution is B: Prayer\n```", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": ": make fire D: leave the situation E: pray\nOutput: 1: The question is asking for a solution to the \"problem\" faced by the neolithic person, or in other words, a way to address hunger.\n2. The provided options suggest ways to seek food or overcome hunger: hunting for food, making fire to cook food, and praying for help.\n3. Based upon the descriptions of the options, we can infer the most probable solution.\n4. Option A \"thank god\" implies that the neolithic people relied on divine help to meet their needs and was not a solution they would implement themselves.\n5. Option C \"Make fire\" doesn't make use of personal effort, rather it relies on external factors to produce results. Furthermore, it could potentially pose more issues, rather than solve them as it introduces a new level of complexity.  \n6. Option D \"leave the situation\" would not adequately address the issue of hunger, as it would be a temporary solution only.\n7. Option G \"pray\" does not explicitly mention a solution and rather implies a passive approach to the problem of hunger.\n8. Hence, the solution we can infer from the given options is D: hunt for food.\nSo the final choice is D: hunt\n\nInput: I want to become a better mathematician. What should I do?

{"text": ": pray D: grow\nOutput: 1: The context of the question makes it clear that the answer needs to relate to how the neolithic person would have solved their hunger problem.\n2. Options A and B can be ruled out as they relate to either thanking a deity for food, or praying to a deity for food. While both of these are ways of expressing gratitude to a higher power, it is unclear how these options relate to the concept of growing one's own food.\n3. Option C can be ruled out as it relates to praying for someone else which is not directly related to the concept of growing ones own food.\n4. Option D can be ruled out as while growing food would be a way to solve the problem, it doesn't explicitly specify that the neolithic people used this solution.\n5. Therefore the answer is the correct option is C: grow.\nSo the final solution is C: grow\n\nInput: The people who made the video on social media were being very generous in giving what?

The people who made the social media video are being generous in giving of their what? the answer can be one of the following: time and skills, creativity, free labour, support, or effort.\n3. The options available suggest 'time and skills' and 'effort' is the best option.\n4. The people are being generous in the sense that they are giving something of value, and that something is both their time and skills, or their effort.\n5. From this we can deduce that the correct answer is 'time and skills'\nSo the final answer would be time and skills\n\nInput: Many animals that live in the ocean are adapted to live there, so they have what?

In response to this dilemma, they devised innovative solutions.\n2)We can use the information provided to determine whether the solutions provided are viable options.\n3)Option B is the most plausible, as hunting food is a common practice for those with limited farming abilities.\n4)Option C is the most viable option as it would address the issue of inefficient food harvesting.\n5)Option A is a viable suggestion for people with the right resources and connections, but it doesn\u2019t address the Neolithic person\u2019s specific requirements.\n6) The same applies to Option E, as it would require the acquisition of weapons, which may be unavailable to the Neolithic population.\n7) Finally, option D addresses the food harvesting issue, but it requires substantial infrastructure and resources. This would be impractical for the Neolithic individual due to their limited capabilities and technology.\n8) Therefore, based on the information provided and the viability of the offered suggestions, option B: Hunt for food would be the most plausible solution for the Neolithics person.\n9) Therefore, the correct answer would be Option B: hunt for  food.\nSo the final anwser would be B: hunt for fruit\n\nInput: When a boy was 7 years old, He loved to play outdoors.

The neolithi cultures valued fire because of the numerous uses it had for them\n3.) However, with limited resources and a desire to stay at home, they were forced to invent new solutions to overcome their problem.\n4.) The use of fire was already a prominent issue in Neolithic culture and using it may not be possible without the aid of an outside source (like a cane).\n5.) This is demonstrated through the use of firecane, where a cane was used to strike a spark off of flint and create a fire.\n6.) Therefore the answer is E: use a cane.\nSo the final analysis of the answer is E: cane\n\nInput: What makes a bolt-action rifle different from a rifle using other methods?

A rifle uses metal cartridges that can be inserted into magazines to load and store them, whereas a bolt-action gun uses individual cartridges\n3. A rifle has a stock and a butt to support the weight of the gun and balance the rifle, whereas most bolt-action rifles do not have any special features\n4. A bolt-action gun takes less time to reload and is easier to maintain and repair than a rifle\n5. A rifle has one trigger mechanism inside the gun that needs to be squeezed with one finger from a distance from one person in one motion at a time\n6. The bolt-action rifleb is unique in this area because it can be fired and cocked with one trigger, allowing for a steady shot\n7. Therefore, from the information provided we know that\n8. bolt-action rifeles are known for the distinctive sound they make when firing because of the way they are designed. this sound, which is distinct in bolt-action guns from the sound made by conventional rifles when firing, can be seen as an indicator that your bolt", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": make a snare trap D: eat twigs E: make a fire\nOutput: 1.) The neolithic period is known as a time where humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one based around agriculture.\n2.) The neolithics people faced the challenge of food scarcity and had to be resourceful in order to survive.\n3.) Option A: \"thank god\" doesn't necessarily refer to a solution or strategy, but rather a response to the hunger.\n4.) Option B: \"hunt for food\" is a strategy that the neolithic person used to acquire food, but it's not an immediate solution to the issue of hunger.\n5.) Option C: \"make a snare trap\" is a strategy that could potentially have been used by the neolithic people, but it doesn'twouldn't necessarily address the direct issue of hunger. \n6.) Option D: \"eat twigs\" refers to a strategy that the neoplitic people might have used to supplement their diet and alleviate hunger pangs, it doesn't directly solve the issue of hunger or satisfy the craving.\n7.) Option E: \"make a fire\"  is a strategy that the nomads used to obtain food by cooking it over a fire, hence solving the issue of hunger\n8.) Therefore, based on the context and reasoning, the answer is E - \"make a fire\"\nSo the final answer would be E: Make a fire\n\nInput: The pond was frozen, so Dwayne decided, I will run over the ice and what?

{"text": ": pray for food D: catch a fish E: hope for food\nOutput: 1) The question is about a neolithic person's solution to a problem of hunger.\n2.`Hunting for food' is an option, however, it doesn't necessarily reflect the neolithic period when hunting was more prevalent.\n3. Options like `catching a fish' or `hope for food' are possible, however, they are not necessarily the key to solving the problem of hunger. Praying for food is a possible option, but is it enough to fulfill the person's need for food? \n4. Option 'thank god' does not explain a way to satisfy hunger immediately or solve impending hunger in the short term.\n5. Therefore we can infer the key element from the given options is `pray for food', which answers the question.\nSo the final answered is D: catch a fish. The final answer is Option D: catch a fish\n\nInput: What do a cat's paw and a finger have in common, they are used to pick something up. What is this something? Choices:  a dog bone B: a treat C: a flower D: a toy E: an ant\nOutput: 1)`A cat's paw is a common paw-shaped pussy footing of cats, and thus is similar to a finger in terms of shape;\n2)Both cat paw and finger can be used to pick something up, such as a treat, flower, toy, or even an ant;\n3)The most common thing that cat paws and fingers are used to pick up is a treat. In fact, cats and dogs often use their paws and fingers to grab delicious treats.\n4)Therefore, the most likely answer is Option B, which is the most likely answer.\nSo the final and correct answer is B: a treat\n\nInput: He was in a rush.

{"text": ": invent rice paddies D: invent plowing E: hunt for food\nOutput: 1: We can break down the question as, \"In the Neolithic era, what was the most common way to satiate hunger?\". \n2. From the given options, we can deduce the most suitable choice.\n3. Option A 'Thank God' does not directly relate to the problem or possible solutions. \n4. Option B 'Hunt for food' could be an answer, but hunt for food implies the availability of resources and may not necessarily be a viable solution.\n5. Option C 'Invent rice paddies' cannot be the solution since it is possible for humans to hunt for food and it does not necessarily involve technology or innovation to grow rice.\n6. Option D 'Invent plowing' could be a possible solution, but it is not related to hunger or satiation.\n7. Looking at the options, we can see that it is logical, and the most sensible option would be 'hunt for food'.\n8. Option E 'hunt for food' seems the most logical option as it directly addresses the problem and provides a solution.\n9. Therefore from the context and options, the answer is likely D: hunt for food.\nSo the final solution is D: Hunting for food\n\nInput: How are the English and Chinese languages similar? Choices: 1. A: phonetical B: pronounced C: written D: phonemic E: vocabulary\nOutput\n1. First we need to understand the similarities between English and Chinese based on different aspects such as pronunciation and writing.\n1. The word similar can denote an inherent sameness between two things but it also can often be used in context and meaning. \n2. Based on the given options, we see that two similarities seem to be phonetics and written language. \n3. The correct answer should focus on commonalities rather than distinct difference. And the term written, while not necessarily including characters, is generally thought of in terms of characters.\n4. Therefore option B 'written' is similar between both languages and does not have any distinctions in pronunciation. So from the context, the answer is B: written.\nSo the final similarities are only B: written.", "answer": " 80"}
{"text": ": make a fire D: pray E: farm\nOutput: 1) First, the question refers to a Neolithic person, indicating that the era mentioned is during the Stone Age (specifically later Paleolithic period for context).\n2) It suggests that the person is in a situation where they are hungry and needing a solution;\n3) Among the given options, Farm, Pray, & Thank God are not possible solutions for a person starving to death;\n4) The last option, Fire, can be a solution that would allow the person to cook something and make it more edible;\n5) This way, Pray can be ruled out, because if the person is dying, there can be nothing to thank God for; Likewise, Fire can be ruled out, as this is an option that can be used to cook, and not exactly the most pressing need of the starving person. This leaves us with Hunting as the possible answer, since HUNT is clearly the best way to acquire food. So, if the person is starving and on the verge of death, they could try to hunt and kill an animal, which would provide them with food as well as help them survive.\n6) Thus, the correct answer for the question is D: Hunt.\nSo the final comment is D: Hunt\n\nInput: Which type of flower has 5 petals and thrives in winter climates?

Looking at the type of flower that has 5 petals, all of the options but D are excluded.\n3.) Among the options, it is clear that only option D is excluded from the petal condition.\n4.) Given that the flower thrives in winter climate, this implies that the flower must survive extreme cold to function properly.\n5.) Looking at the five options that survive extreme cold, only the option A is excluded.\n6.) It is evident, therefore, that the correct answer is option C \u2013 the African Aster.\nSo the final choice is C:", "answer": " 54"}

The context is the Neolithic period, which is often referred to as the age of agriculture. In this period, people began to settle down and practice agriculture.\n2.) The question then asks about the solution of one of the early civilizations to the problem of hunger.\n3.) Given the context, it is likely that the solution is related to agriculture.\n4.) Option A can be eliminated as it is a religious solution.\n5.) Option B can be eliminated as hunting for food is more of a primitive solution to hunger, which the neolithic people already moved past.\n6.) Option C can be eliminated as growing crops would be a solution to the hunger of neolithic people, not the initial problem of being hungry.\n7.) Option D can be eliminated as making soup is not a solution to the problem of hungering; it is more of a result of agriculture. \n8.) The answer must be option E as The use of a microwave would be a more modern solution to hunger rather than a solution to the initial problem of being hungrey.\n9.) Therefore, the answer is Option E: use a micowave.\nSo the final answe is E: use a micwave\n\nInput: Who can teach a man to fish? Choices:  a. the bible b. cinderella c. god d. the government e. the king\nOutput: 1) First, the question asks who can teach a man to \"fish\", presumably meaning a skill or knowledge that they do not currently have.\n2) The bible refers to a collection of religious texts, while Cinderella does not provide the answer to the riddle and could be seen as unrelated to the question.\n3) Although God is sometimes characterized as the source of knowledge and wisdom, it does not seem like he would be capable of teaching someone how to \"fish\", as that would require an individual approach and lessons, which could not be done by an omnipotent entity.\n4) The government is not able to teach someone how to fish due to its large size and bureaucratic nature.\n5) The king is not a reliable teacher of fishing skills due to his position", "answer": " 95"}

It indicates that there was a human who was hungry and needed to find food.\n2) Looking at the options given, the most logical answer to satisfy a hungry human is D: make tools so that they can make dinner. \n3) Option A, \"thank God\" is referring to a supernatural being and it seems unlikely in an archaic hunter-gatherer society that people will thank a deity for their food.\n4) Option B, \"hunt for food\" refers to seeking out wild game/animal products in order to eat. This would have been a common practice, but it is not a solution to the problem at hand. \n5) Option C \"asking people for help\" does not seem like a viable solution given that the human is described as being \"neolithic\". \n6) Option E \"gathering their own food\" is a valid option, but it does not provide a solution to the problem of being hungry.\nSo the final answers are C: ask people for HELP with making dinner and E: GATHERING their own food.\n\nInput: The police are called to help an old man,  It's suspected he's living in his car.

{"text": ": collect food D: plant food E: gather food\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the solution to the problem of hunger faced by neolithic people.\n2: The word 'hungry' suggests that the person's only option was to find food, which leads us to believe that 'hunt' is not the correct option.\n3: 'collect' is somewhat vague as it covers a range of activities, including gathering and picking.  Hence, 'gather' is not the correct response.\n4: Similarly, 'plant food' is also vague as it covers various activities related to planting crops or food, such as growing, harvesting, and tending.  It also doesn't clearly describe the type of food the person would be planting, which gives us little information about the correct choice.\n5: The options 'gather food' and 'hunt for food' are clearly problematic as they are synonymous and not clearly defined. They also don't sufficiently describe the context of the problem or the correct response.\n6: The remaining option, 'plant food', seems to be the most appropriate as it describes clearly what food neolithic people would plant and how they would do it.\n7: The context suggests that the neolithic people were not necessarily able to hunt or gather food as it was difficult for them, which is further supported by the statement 'plant food' that allows them to easily obtain food.\n8: Therefore, based on the given information, the answer is 'E: Plant food' because it clearly describes what the people did to solve their problem. \nSo the final answer will be E: Plant food\n\nInput: A person who is depressed has what in common with a person who is tired?

{"text": ": bang a tree D: eat whatever E: wait for god to help\nOutput: 1 We know that the Neolithic period is the period of human history during which people primarily focused on farming and herding of animals.\n2. This means that they would have no access to foods like fresh fruits and vegetables, and would typically survive off of grains or animals.\n3. With this information, we can understand why the 'hunt for food' option doesn't make sense and the 'bang a tree' option is unlikely, as Neolithic people would be more likely to rely on agriculture.\n4. 'Thank god' would suggest that the Neolithics were religious or had a spiritual belief. This doesn't make sense.\n5. 'Wait for god to help' is an absurd option, as it does not make sense in light of the context.\n6. Therefore, the answer must be 'eat whatever' as this is the logical choice given the context of food scarcity and lack of access to fresh produce.\nSo the final choice is A: eat whatever\n\nInput: Who designed the pyramids? Choices:  M: Egyptians A: Giza B: Ancient egyptians C: Masons D: Pharaohs E: Greeks\nOutput: 1) This question is asking about which group or individual created the pyramids, so option 'G': Greeks is not the correct answer as the pyramids are not Greek.\n2) Option 'M' (Egyptians), however, is possible as they were the group, though not individuals, that built the pyramids.\n3) Option 'A' (Giza), is not correct as Giza is a city in Egypt, not a specific pyramid. \n4) Option 'B' (Ancient Egyptian), is the correct choice, as \"the ancient Egyptian pyramids are among the most famous and only-remaining great wonders of the ancient world.\"\nSo the final answer would be B: Ancient Egyptians\n\nInput: What is a person with high energy?

Choices: A: matches B: a flashlight C: a canteen D: a torch E: a lamp \nOutput: 1: The question suggests that a person is traveling through the desert and is in possession of a canteen, which can be used to carry water.\n2. Additionally, the question asks for the other item that the person may carry to help them in their travels.\n3. Based of the given information, a likely answer could be any of the options mentioned, however, using logic and reasoning.\n4. Option A: matches, has an implication that the person is also carrying a flint, making the implied situation redundant.\n5. Option 2: Flashlight is not necessarily needed in the desert, as it implies artificial lighting, which can be redundant in most deserts. \n6. The only choice left is C: Canteen. \n7. Therefore the answer is C: Canteens.\nSo the final Answer is C: CANTEEN", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": look for plants D: get a job E: hunt for animals\nOutput: 1: The context of the question is about a neolithic person and their hunger.\n2. The questions tells us that they were hungry because they were 'Hungry'.\n3. So, we need to identify which of the choices is most appropriate for a solution to hunger.\n4. Looking for plants is typically associated with finding food, but this might not be a practical solution (e.g. if the person is wandering around the desert).\n5. Looking for animals is also a practical solution because it can be easier for a neolithic community to catch and hunt them.\n6. Hunt for food seems to be the easiest solution and would probably be the best choice.\n7. Thus, from the context, the answer is D, get a job.\nSo the final answers is D: get a job\n\nInput: Where in the body could you find fibrous tissue? Choices: 1) outside A: Intestines 2) around E: Kidneys 3) between B: Skin 4) beside C: Nose\nOutput: 1) First, we can break down the context of the question into the following categories: Where in the body, What is it called, and Where would we find it?\n2) Based on the information provided, we can infer that the question is asking about tissue found in the human body.\n3) Since there is fibrous tissue in the human body, we can eliminate the other choices as inappropriate.\n4) After eliminating the choices related to other organs or non-physically fibrous objects, we can narrow down our options to:\n5) Skin- 71% cover of skin is composed of fibrous tissue.\n6) Intestines- There is a layer of fibrous (tensile) tissue in the intestines to help it contract and propel ingesta forward.\n7) Kidneys- Fibrous tissue is seen in the frog kidney, the structure of which may be used in the study of kidneys.\n8) Nose- 12% of the fibrous tissue is found in the nasal cavity.\n9) After a thorough analysis of the context and a closer assess", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": ": pray to god D: pray for food E: worship god\nOutput: 1.\"Hungry\" implies a person or being who is running short on food and feels an urgent need to obtain more to alleviate their hunger.\n2. There are many reasons for feeling the need to obtain more food, including lack of food or the need for more food. Some examples could include: not being able to find enough food, feeling unable to find/cultivate more food, having a limited supply of food, feeling the need to cultivate or find more food, or not being able to obtain enough food.\n3. These reasons could be related to one or more of the following: personal circumstances, environment, availability of resources, or seasonal changes.\n4. \"Neolithic\" indicates a time when humans transitioned from a hunter-gatherer society to a more settled, agricultural-based society. This could indicate that the answer is associated with an agricultural-based society or way of life, and therefore we should focus on the choices that are most related to this type of lifestyle.\n5. \"Pray to God\" refers to seeking help from a higher power or deity, which may be used as an option when the person is not able to procure enough food through other means.\n6. \"Pray for food\" refers specifically to the act of praying for something in the hope that it will be provided in the future.\n7. \"Worship God\" refers to the act of worshiping or paying homage to God as the ultimate source of power and authority.\n8. Looking at the wording of the choices, it appears that \"Worship God\", \"Pray to God\", and \"Pray for Food\" are all related. They are asking about a lifestyle in which God is sought for help, whether in prayer or via worship.\n9. \"Thank god\" refers to expressing gratitude or appreciation to God for the blessings and abundance that we receive. The phrase may be used to indicate a state of abundance or sufficiency.\n10.

{"text": ": gather berries D: ask friends E: gather and store\nOutput: 1 - The first thing that comes to mind is the phrase \"hunt for food\" which is associated with gathering berries.\n\n2 - \"Hunting for food\" might be a solution in certain contexts, but not in all situations, especially where there is no available space or food source.\n3 - \"Asking friends\" requires two things, firstly, friends must be available, secondly, they must respond to the request.\n4 - \"Gather and store\" is an obvious solution. It involves gathering food and storing it so that it is available in case of future necessities.\n5 - \"Thank God\" doesn't really address the problem of having a shortage of food. Plus, it seems impractical to simply wait on food to be provided by divine intervention.\n6 - This leaves option E, which is the only choice that makes sense in the context of the question.\n7 - Therefore, the answer would be E: Gather and store.\nSo the final correct answer is E: Gather and Store\n\nInput: What did the first neolithic people find when they arrived in North America?

Given the hunger is the main problem it's the solution has to reflect this problem the other options are irrelevant to the solution to the hungery problem as they don't really address the problem of how the person's hunger was solve this is why the other options should be irrelevant in making a determination as to be what the solution to the hungary problem is.\n6. We know from the question what happened when, we do not know if the other options happened or not we have no such reason to believe so.\n7. The conclusion does not address whether the neolithic person used the other options as alternatives for the solution to the hungury problem rather it infers that the options are there as part of the solution to the problem.\n8. If the neolithic people used the other options as the solution to the problem the conclusion should be the other options and not just the solution provided in the option.\n9. The choice of options implies to us that the neolithic peopled did not use them as part of the solution if they had what kind of solution would they have then used and how would the person be hungrey without these other options?\n10 How does this apply to the solution to the problem which we already identified as the one presented by the author not others.\n11.

This is why we are looking for if the options were considered.\n13. We do not make that kind of inference here.\n14.

The question refers to the United States and asks for the name of the republic / democratic system of government in the country.\n2.) There is a mix-up in the options as given, which is confusing for the reader.\n3.) The answer needs to be from the options given in the previous line.\n4.) The sentence implies that the term'republic' needs to be added to the answer for it to make sense.\n5.) Using this, the three options that make sense are A, J, and J.\n6.)

{"text": ": grow food D: take in hungry neighbors E: pray\nOutput: 1) We have a situation in which a Neolithic person was \"hungry\" and their response to that was to pray for \"what to\". \n2) We don't really know the reason why they were hungry or anything about their situation, so we can't really draw any conclusions about a solution that \"worked\".\n3) There is no mention of how much time has passed, so the \"what\" that was prayed for could have been food or anything else.\n4) The given options only involve actions that can take some time to be effective or bring in results but no action is mentioned (other than praying) to be taken in immediate time to address the food issue.\n5) There is also no information given about whether hungry neighbors might also have been praying to God for food (which would potentially solve the problem), so the option to \"take in hungry neighbors\" might not be the best option, as it would solve the problem of the one praying, not the problem that is mentioned as to \"the hungry\".\n6) From the options given, \"grow food\" would be the best option, assuming that the problem with the answer is the hunger and it needs to be resolved now so as to prevent starvation.\nBy doing this, one can grow food, which would be food that would be useful in the immediate time to address the hunger problem. \n7) The other option that might be useful would be to find or hunt for food, but \"hunt for food\" might be difficult in the given context as there is no reference to a timeframe or a setting to do so.

The neolithic people's solution to their problem of hunger can be determined by studying their activities and interactions with the environment.\n3. It's clear from the options that they grew and hunted for food rather than thanking a divine entity or eating fish, suggesting their chosen solution to the problem was to grow their own food or hunt for it.\n4. Option A \"Thank God\" suggests an act of religious devotion, which is not an answer that is appropriate for the given circumstances or question.\n5. Option C \"Grow it\" is a logical step in the context, as it suggests that the neolithic person could have taken the initiative to grow their own food rather than relying on divine intervention or luck.\n6. Likewise, option D - \"Make it\" - is an appropriate answer given the question and solution context, as it refers to the manufacturing or production of food, which the neolithic people may have accomplished by hunting and gathering.\n7. Option B \"Hunt for Food\" is another appropriate answer given the context, as it indicates that the neolithical had to actively pursue food in order to survive and avoid famine and hunger, as they did not have reliable access to resources or stores of food.\n8. Another appropriate and relevant option is E \"Eat Fish,\" which suggests that the neolihic person may have exploited opportunist resources and eaten whatever fish or animals they could to survive.\n9. Hence based on the given context, the likely answers are C, D, and E\n10.

Option A focuses on prayer or divine providence while Option B is about hunting as a source of food. Option C is about war, specifically hunting or food foraging, while Option D focuses on food digestion.\n3. Based off these options, we can understand that the choice E \"go to work\" could mean a person working until they have food.  In that sense, this option provides the best answer to the solution to the problem.\nSo the final choice is E: go to work\n\nInput: My roommate and I had a big what?

Options A and B suggest a verbal disagreement, while option D can imply the dispute was violent.\n5.) Option E might refer to a serious disagreement, but it does not give clear evidence of the severity.\n6.) Option C is the only option left with a clear indication of how big/serious the dispute was; it suggests that the disagreement was significant enough to cause an argument with yelling, screaming, and foul language, which is a more significant dispute than an ordinary heated argument.\n7.) Therefore, the conclusion is that the dispute was probably not a small one and most probably a significant disagreement represented by option C.\nSo the final conclusions is that the dispute was a \"big spat\".", "answer": " 5"}

The options given are:\n     - B Hunting for food: This option does not take into account the neolithic people's ability to create and cultivate their own food. This option is thus not a viable solution for the neolithic person's hunger.\n     - C Growing food: This option refers to neolithic people growing their own crops to satisfy their hunger. But, we know that the neolithic era was characterized by a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The neolithic people didn't have the technology or means to create their own food. Therefore, this option can be ruled out. \n     - D Relying on the government: This option refers to relying on the government to provide food, which is not a viable solution due to the lack of infrastructure and technology during the neolithic period.\n     -  E Praying to the gods: This option indicates a lack of scientific knowledge and a reliance on superstition, which wasn't a prevalent trait at the time of the neolithic age. \n     - A Thanking God: This option indicates a belief in religion, which was not prevalent in the neolithic lifestyle.\n3.

The first sentence of the question clearly indicates that \"neolithic people\" (in plural sense) were dealing with a problem of being hungry.\n2. Among the choices, option B is the one where people \"shop for food\" while shopping spree is the one with option D is where they \"hunt for food\". \n3. However, there is no evidence in the question for there being multiple people (plural) and if the question is about one particular person the plural use of the word \"people\" seems odd.\n4. Also, the words \"their solution\" in the question don't seem to refer to any of the previous options provided. \n5. From a literal reading of the question, it seems that the answer would be the last answer option of E: Do nothing.\n6. However, we cannot rule out any of the other answers either as they seem to be viable options, based on the given context. \n7. Therefore, we may need to look at the other context provided in the question, which is describing how neolithic people were \"thanking their gods.\"\n8. In terms of the context given, it makes more sense that the neolithic people would use their knowledge of agriculture and hunt for food through farming and fishing.\n9. Therefore the correct answer would be either C: Go on a shopping sprees (using the land for hunting, hunting for food with their own hands) or A: thank god (i.e. pray for rains that may lead to good harvests and hence, more food)\n10. However, the use of \"thank god\" is vague and could also be used to indicate something like a prayer, but even in this interpretation the context does not seem to fit as the question doesn't say anything about praying.\n11. So the most likely answer would be Option A, followed by C.\nSo the final answers are A: thank god and C: Go on a Shopping spree", "answer": " 99"}
{"text": ": find food D: be resourceful E: be lucky\nOutput: 1 The answer can be found in the text that the person, \"hungry\", is having a problem of not having food which they want, so the \"solution\" here is \"to be resourceful\" as it is the best way you can solve any problem you might have.\n2 The options can be ruthlessly narrowed down to : A: thank god and be resourceful - which cannot be true combination as thanking someone is showing your attitude and resourcefulness is a solution to your problem. \n3 B: hunt for-food and be resourceful - This is just a bad option because we can't say \"Hunt For food\" is a solution to your issue\n4 C: find food and be resourceful - this is a good option but not the only one and might not be the only way to solve your problem\n5 D: be resourceful and be lucky - this is not the only solution to your problem and is really a solution and not a solution, so not the right answer. \n6 E: be lucky and be resourceful - like other options, its not the only solution and not the only way to solve problem and also not the right answer.\n7 So, in sum we only have C: find food and E: be resourceful as the only correct answer.\nSo the final answers is E: be resourceful", "answer": " 48"}

The Neolithic person was a hunter-gatherer who lived a nomadic or semi-nomadic lifestyle and existed during the Old Stone Age, also known as the Palaeolithic period.\n2. They lived more than 10,000 years ago.\n3. The Neolithic diet included wild and domesticated plants and animals. They foraged for nuts, berries, fish, and game, but mostly depended on grains as they were easy to harvest.\n4. Hence, Neolithic people had access to food through hunting and farming.\n5. The answer to our question has to be based on the context.\n6. In the context of food scarcity, they would likely not be sad but instead look for a way to get food.\n7. So, the answer is D.\nSo the final choice is D: create whats\n\nInput: Dust off - To what?

{"text": ": cook D: farm E: eat plants\nOutput: 1: By examining the choices given, we can deduce the likely solution to a hunger problem faced by a neolithic person.\n2. The choice 'hunt for food can be eliminated since it does not solve the problem of being hungry.\n3. The choice 'cook' can be discarded as it refers to a process of using kitchen facilities to prepare food, which may not be available to a primitive individual.\n4. The choice 'farm' could involve planting food crops and harvesting produce to address the problem, but it does not automatically mean the food is available without having to hunt for it.\n5. Lastly, the choice 'eat plants' could also solve the hunger issue, but it only refers to the possibility of finding and eating plants. Not having an appropriate location to prepare the food could still result in being hungry.\n6. The most likely solution would likely be option 'eat plant's.\n7. The reasoning behind this answer is that eating plants will result in the hunger being solved, but it is still dependent on the individual being able to find and eat the plants.\n8. Considering the scenario, this option may not provide the desired conclusion.\n9. Therefore the answer is likely to D: eat plants\nSo the final answer as D: eat plants\n\nInput: What about something very important, like a wedding ring? It could be lost.

The main question here is about an item that could be lost. The question does not provide any information about the item other than its level of importance. This means we do not know what the item is or whether it can be purchased.\n11. In this context, the answer to the question would be B: a locksmtih because you would require a locksmith's services to repair or replace your items if they are lost.\n11. For a priest or money, you might ask about an item that is important but not lost. For a detective, you could ask about the loss of a valuable item or whether it is possible for detectives to find lost items", "answer": " 2"}

This suggests an emotional response to the problem of hunger and would be unlikely to be a practical solution.\n4. B) Hunting for food: This might be the neolithic solution to the problem of hungering, as hunting would require certain skill sets that are acquired over time and thus may not necessarily be accessible to this person.\n5. C) Cooking for food: Cooking may have been possible, as it would require skills in preparation and fire-making.\n6. D) Eating grass: This scenario is not very feasible, as grass is not a sustainable feeding source and may not be suitable for a person's nutritional needs (depending on what kind of grass is consumed).\n7. E) Starve: This scenario is not recommended, as it is not sustainable in the long run and could potentially lead to malnutrition or serious health conditions.\n8.

The option 'hunt for food', implies that hunt was their solution to the hunger problem, which is not supported by the context of the question.\n4) Option C 'Eat wild animals' cannot be correct because while Option C does mention 'eat', the question specifies that the Neopolitic person was 'happy' indicating positive emotion. This means that 'Eat wild animals', is not what the person was happy about, but something different.\n5) The option 'Invent a cooking process' makes sense because the answer mentions the invention of agriculture, which also refers to cooking and food preparation.\n6) Thus, it can be inferred from the options that, the most appropriate answer is option 'D: agriculture'.\n7) Therefore, the answer is option 'D'.\nSo the final answer D: agriculture\n\nInput: In the nineteen sixties most people had dial-up phone systems,  what would you most likely hear in the background on a long-distance call?

The question asks us to provide an appropriate choice which would be the most logical solution for a neolithic person to a problem where they were hungry.\n3. In the choice options provided, A (thanking God) does not seem a common solution of the problem. It may be a personal belief but doesn't seem fitting for this type of problem.\n4.

Option C (get the gods to send them) again is not a solution which connects with the problem and is a non-logical one, which is why the answer is eliminated.\n6. Option D (make and eat food) could be one solution used by the neo-lithic person to deal with the problem of hunger.\n7. Option e (die) is not considered as a possible solution to the problem and thus eliminated from the choices.\n8. Therefore, the most logical answer is B: hunt for the food.\nSo the final answers is B: hunt\n\nInput: Cut the number of words in a sentence by how many?

{"text": ": grow vegetables D: eat meat E: build shelter\nOutput: 1: The following sentence helps make the context clear: \"During early times, when man lived in the caves, there was no bread or other convenient food.\"\n2. It is known that people during early times, such as during the Neolithic period had to hunt and/or farm for food.\n3. Therefore, from the available options, we can see that choice B: grow vegetables is the best option as it fits the context and is a plausible solution, considering that people had to rely on farming and hunting animals for food.\n4. Choice A: thank god may be a common way to express gratitude, but it is not a solution to the problem of hunger.\n5. Choice C: eat meat involves killing animals and may not be an option due to ethical, environmental or health concerns.\n6. Choice D: build shelter is not a solution to hunger, but may be necessary for survival in the harsh environment.\n7. Choice E: grow vegetables is a possible solution to the hunger problem, given that people were able to grow crops and have a variety of healthy options.\nSo the final solution is B: grow vegetables.\n\nInput: A good parent must be what to their child? Choices: 1: firm with rules, 2: gentle, 3: strict with limits, 4: flexible, 5: lenient\nOutput: 1 It makes sense to understand the context of the question.\n2 It is clear that the right answer would be something that can be associated with a good parent, i.e. strict with limits which comes under option 3.\n3 So the answer is\n4. A good parent would also be someone who is flexible, as there needs to be some give and take in parenting and a strict approach may not be the most effective or desirable in some cases.\n5. A good parent should be able to be gentle with their child, as well as able to set limits and be strict. It's important to find a balance between these two things.\nSo the final result is 5: flexible\n\nInput: What is the best thing about getting to school from the side door?

{"text": ": pray for help D: eat grass E: none of the above\nOutput: 1: First, we need a full understanding of the question. \n2. From the question, we know that a neolithic person who was in need was \"hungry.\"\n3. They may have been aware that the situation may require help or action, but there wasn't any help readily available.\n4. This prompts us to the various given choices, which we look at in the context of our understanding of the scenario.\n5. Option a \"thank god\" does not speak to the actual problem we can see from our understanding of the situation.\n6. Option B \"hunt for food\" makes sense in the context, but it's not an immediate action that can help deal with the situation.\n7. Option c \"pray for help\" is not action-oriented, but it's possible that the neolithic person would have thought their situation was beyond them to fix because of a lack or absence of help.\n8. Option d \"eat grass\" is not very likely to be the solution in the given circumstances because it speaks to a more desperate situation with starvation for survival.\n9. From our understanding, option E \"none of the above\" is not actually possible because there are options to choose from, therefore we can rule this out.\n10. Option D \"Eat grass\" speaks to the possibility that the neolithics person could be hungry or dying of starvation.\n11. This is unlikely though because options like \"thank god\" or \"pray for help\", suggest that the neolithis person will attempt to solve the issue by appealing to a higher being.\n12. This speaks to an awareness that the person has a problem that is bigger than them, which they are unable to solve on their own.\n13. With this understanding, option D \"eat grass\" seems like the most plausible option in the long run because the neolithic is not immediately thinking to appeal to anyone to end their hunger.\n14. The neolithic is still hungry and in survival mode, so option D \"Eat grass\", seems feasible.\n15. Therefore, the answer may have been D: eat grass or, in a different form, D: Surv", "answer": " 85"}
{"text": ": dig a well D: cook a stew E: build a table/chair\nOutput: 1, The question refers to the idea of a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and asks the reader to infer the way to solve a problem that these people might have encountered.\n2. Looking at the options offered, we can identify characteristics that a hunter-gathers lifestyle might include in common;\n3. Firstly, a neolithic person would have been hungry and in need of food.\n4. Secondly, they would have been limited to resources and would not have had easy access to everything they wanted.\n5. The provided options only include the ones that could have been achievable using the available resources and with limited manual labor.\n6. Therefore, the solution would likely have to come from something that the neolithic person could have made for themselves.\n7. Looking at the options, we can see that they all involve cooking, preparing, or creating something from resources that are available.\n8. However, based on the given choices and reasoning, we can conclude that \"digging a well\" is unlikely to be an option.\n9. Therefore the answer would have to be something that the neolitic person created themselves and was achievable using the available sources of food/water, or using manual labor, or both.\n10. Since it would be made using the available resources, the answer would likely include something from A: 'cook a stew'\n11. The answer is therefore A: cook a stew.\nSo the final answers is A: cook a stewt\n\nInput: The question asks for a word that means something, in this case,'something'.\n1. The word'something' has an implicit'meaning'.\n2. It may be interpreted, though, that'something' could actually mean any/nothing. (This is what the question refers to).\n3. Therefore, the question would likely mean, 'what does'something' actually mean?'\n4. There are different 'things' or 'items';\n5. Each meaning refers to a type or instance of 'thing'.\n6. Something is therefore a word that could possibly denote any/all 'things' or anything.\n7. It can be anything that refers to every possibility.\n8.

{"text": ": make shoes D: get fishing rod E: bake food\nOutput: 1 It's a tough question and requires reasoning, I've found from my own research that this is a very tricky question.\n2. However I believe you find the solution\n3. The neolithic people were primitive and lived in the Stone Age, meaning they would have needed to hunt for food.\n4. The answer should be hunt rather than bake or other options because they would have needed to eat meat. \n5. The question indicates that they were hungry which indicates a need for food. \n6. The neoliths would have to hunt for food as it was the only solution that did not involve any form of technology or craft skill. \n7. The only other option that makes sense is bake and fishing rod.\n8. However, these would all require the use of tools that they would not have had yet.\n9. They were hungry so what they needed was food.\n10. Therefore, the answer I think is, that they were hungry so what was their solution? - Hunt to find food.\nSo the final solution will be Hunt.\n\n## Input:\n\nGold coins were 10 times as heavy as silver coins.

A necklace of silver coins E. A mixture of gold and silver coins\n\nOutput: \n1. The ratio tells us that gold coins are 10 times heavier than silver coins and value of a gold coin to silver coin is 95:25 = 4:1.\n2. But since in the last line of question it is mentioned that weight is less important as its value is greater. \n3. Therefore its obvious option A and C is wrong because A: Gold coins are heaviest B: Silver coins are heaviest C: A necklace of gold and silver coimnns D: A necklace of silver and gold coins is heaviest and option D is more logical choice considering its value is greater than gold coins.\n4.

{"text": ": invent recipe D: use a fire\nOutput: 1) First, we understand that given the time period, the Neolithic person would not have had luxuries such as cooking oils, salt, spices, or even modern ovens.\n2) We also understand that fire was not common in that time period.\n3) We can then reason that the Neolithic man would've had to use the fire that he was able to make, in any way that he could, to start a fire.\n4) The only viable option based on the given context and provided evidence is D: use a fire.\n5) The other options are unlikely, and not feasible for the Neolithic age.\nSo, therefor, using a fire was the most viable option to the solution from the choices presented, is option D: use a fire which is the final answer.\n\nInput: He's not the greatest, he's not a superstar, but he is the _???_ of what? Choices A: best B: worst C: worst performer D: best performer E: best player\nOutput: We want to get all the key details because that allows us to know what the text is talking about with the key part. We see that he's not the \"greatest\" and he's \"not a superstar\", we're looking for the word between here to determine who this person is. Let's make more space to see better, so we can see a bigger section. (This is just for better word spacing so it's easier to understand) So, the best guess right now would be that this word would be a word that has to do with sports. A common word in sports is \"player\", so we will guess that it is \"Best Player\", but after reading the options carefully, we see that it is actually \"best performer\". So we know the name of the key character is \"best performer\".", "answer": " 216"}

Choices:  Mighty A:  B:  Burning C:  D:  E:  Ozonic\nOutput: 1) Firstly, this question is about fragrances which are pleasant smells.\n2) If we were to smell the fragrances, there would be many options.\n3) From the given options, B stands out because it is a word that we might not recognize without research and is unpleasant.\n4) Looking at the definitions of the other options, they seem unlikely to be the correct response because they are pleasing smells.\n5) The only definition that closely matches the option that we might come across when smelling a fragrance would be D, which corresponds to pleasant.\n6) So the correct answer is D. Mighty and burning can be excluded as they do not fit the context of the question.\nSo the correct answer is D and the given alternative is Mighty.\n\nInput: At a party, where did everyone congregate?

{"text": ": fish D: grow vegetables E: plant crops\nOutput: 1- The question is asking for how hungry people of the neolithic era dealt with their hunger. \n2- Looking at the provided options, it can be inferred that Option A is incorrect as there is no mention of a belief in a higher power in neolithic cultures and 'Thank god' is not an appropriate response to a hunger problem.\n3- Option B 'hunt for food' refers to the activity of hunting and gathering, a common practice in pre-agricultural societies, including the neolithic age.\n4- Option C 'fish' could be a possible solution, but it wouldn't necessarily have happened in the neolithic, as fishing is a relatively modern way of obtaining food.\n5- Option D 'grow vegetables' may have been a solution, but it would not likely have happened in such an early age, as vegetable farming was introduced much later.\n6- Lastly, Option E 'plant crops' could have been a solution, and it is a logical approach to hunger that would be taken in a later era.\n7- Thus, based on the provided options, the likely answer is E: plant crops. \nSo the final answer to the question is E: plant cro", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": ": grow crops to store D: hunt the meat cook and eat E: grow crops to sell\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the neolithic person's solution to their hunger.\n2: The options given are: thank god, grow crops to store, grow crops to sell, grow crops to cook and eat.\n3: The last two options, grow crops to eat and store, are relevant because they are directly related to eating and food items.\n4: Hunt for the hunt for the game sounds like an activity which would need physical energy and time. Therefore, it isn't the solution to their hunger issue.\n5: Grow crops to sell is an act of storing food for future harvest. However, it doesn't describe how the neolithic people solved their hunger issue. Therefore, it doesn't fit.\n6: Finally, Grow crops to cook and sell is a viable option, but the word'store' in it can also be interpreted as an act of storing food in quantity for later use. Therefore, this option also doesn't fit the solution to the question.\n7: Finally, Grow the crops to cook and to have is the best answer, this directly describes their solution to their hunger problem.\nSo the final answers is C: grow crops for sale.\n\nInput: I'm glad we had a chance to talk.

In this case, the speaker is \"glad\" or happy about having the conversation.\n2: The next part of the sentence includes a list of different options and the associated emotions with each. \n3: The question specifically asks about the emotion of the conversation rather than the overall sentiment, so in this case we should focus on the specific word \"hard\" in the emotion list.\n4: Hard is a negative or difficult emotion, however, this contradicts the original speaker's feeling of being happy or glad about the conversation.\n5: Option A pleasant, in this instance, is considered positive or happy.\n6: Option B helpful would also convey positive feelings about the conversation, so both A and", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": ": make fire D: cook food E: start a fire\nOutput: 1 We see that the Neolithic person was likely to seek something that could help them feed themselves, as it's been mentioned that they were \"hungry\".\n2. The Neolithic person would have likely used one of the following options to \"make fire\" and cook food - \"thank god\", \"make fire\", \"start a fire\", \"hunt for food\", \"cook food\"\n3. \"Thank God\" or \"make fire\" are not specifically ways of cooking food, rather they are ways of praying, or more specific, asking for help.\n4. \"Cook food\" is a particular way of preparing food, such as by baking, boiling, or steaming.\n5. \"Hunt for food\" or \"start a fire\" could refer to a method of catching, trapping, or hunting for food before cooking.\n6. From the given options, we can say that the Neolithian person was likely to have used \"make fire\" or \"start a fires\" to cook their food.\nSo the final answers are D: cook food and start a fire\n\nInput: \"I don't want to look at anything\" is a common what with many people? Choices:  a: saying b: excuse c: response d: statement e: remark\nOutput: 1: The question asks us to identify a common phrase that is used by many people.\n2. The phrase \"I do not want\" or \"I do not want to look at anything.\" can be used as a way to express feelings of dissatisfaction or discomfort when looking at something\n3. The phrase suggests that there is an unwanted item or object that some people have chosen not to look at as they find it unpleasant or distasteful.\n4. While this type of reaction may not be universal, it is a common response for many people who do not want to be exposed to a certain item or object.\n5. This response can be used as an expression of dislike or distaste for something, as well as a way to avoid being exposed to it.\n6. From this response, we could guess that the phrase \"I don't know anything\" could be used as a specific response by some people.\nSo the final response is D: response\n\nInput:", "answer": " 320"}
{"text": ": grow food D: make food E: forage for food\nOutput: 1) The question is about a particular period in history called the neolithic era, when people were primarily dependent on hunting and foraging for food.\n2) One of the solutions that people during this period used to find food was to hunt for it.\n3) This option can be supported by the fact that hunting is a skill that humans have been practicing for a long time. \n4) It involves killing animals and gathering their food source, which was an essential part of the neolithic diet. \n5) Other options like \"growing food,\" \"making food,\" and \"foraging for food\" are probably not relevant to the neolithic period, as they imply the use of agricultural techniques that were not widespread during this time.\n6) Overall, the correct answer to the question is D.\nSo the final answers is D: make food\n\nInput: Your neighbor is talking about his dog, which is a mixed breed.

{"text": ": pray D: go to market E: build a home\nOutput: 1) So, first, let's try to understand the question in context and consider the time reference. The neolithic era was thousands of years ago, so their perspective and solution to the problem likely differed from ours in multiple ways.\n2) The answer to the given question can be found by looking at the given options. However, it's imperative to understand that each of these options has a negative implication.\n3) If we were to look at this from the perspective of our modern society, we can say that \"hunt for food\" and \"build a home\" were solutions to a hunger problem for people during the Neolithic era.\n4) However, options B and D imply gratitude, which the question doesn't directly ask.\n5) When looking at options A and C, we can say that the best and most practical solutions to a hunger issue for a person during the Neolithoc era was to \"go to the market/trade/barter\". This was done by hunting as well as building/gaining access to the marketplace.\n6) Furthermore, these solutions may not have been used immediately, but over time because hunting and building a home are time-consuming activities. The options presented in the question only emphasize that the individual was \"hungry\" for whatever reason the question doesn't ask, but they are options that the hungry person likely had to consider.\n7) In conclusion, the answer to the given question is C.\nSo the final Answer is C: Go to market, trade, barter", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": ": get food from the city's dining hall D: pick up food E: eat\nOutput: 1) The given options are of varied options that people could take based on the situation described.\n2) To understand the context, we need to know what kind of \"city's dining hall\" is being referred to.\n3) Since we do not know the context the options given are quite general.\n4) However, we know about the situation being described and that the people involved are \"neolithic people\", giving a clear time period.\n5) \"Neolithic people\" are in a \"neolithic village\" which means that they are living in simpler surroundings.\n6) This means that the people are likely to be hungry but without the ability to get easy access to food that easily. If we consider the options, option E (to eat) seems the most direct and simplest option for the neolithic person.\n7) However, it's likely that option E wouldn't have been possible in their situation, without food readily available because people in the neolithic village would have been dependent on hunting for food.\n8) In a village, people live with each other, and so we can infer that food from hunting could have been shared within the village.\n9) Therefore, option C (Get food from the village's dining hall) is probably more suitable.\n10) This is a situation of people depending on each other for resources.\n11) People in the village depend on each other, and the question does not detail the other people in relation to food.\n12) Therefore, we can say that the answer of the question is related to food from the village'sh dining hall.\nSo the final result is C: Get food from the village'd dining hall\n\nInput: A carbohydrate is in food as what?

{"text": ": cook up a solution D: get on a diet E: solve the problem\nOutput: 1- Firstly, we must understand the question, which mentions a hungry \"neolithic\" person and asks us to \"solve the problem.\"\n2. The \"neolithic period\" refers to a time before agriculture had been invented, so any idea that a \"neolithic person\" could solve their hunger issue through farming or agriculture will be untenable.\n3. The question's context is focused on early human societies in which hunting was a primary source of food.\n4. The given options should be analyzed in light of these parameters.\n5. Option C \"cook up a solution\" is not a logical option as it would have to refer to an individual cooking on the spot rather than bringing food with them, which was more typical of the way ancient humans hunted.\n6. Option D \"get on a diet\" is not applicable as this person was already hungry and unable to eat, which means they were unlikely to have the mental and physical capacity to \"get on a dient.\"\n7. Option E \"solve the problem\" is logically sound as hunted animals were a mainstay of the \"neolithic diet,\" thus \"solving\" the problem of hunger.\n8. Therefore. the answer is E: solve the problem.\nSo the final choice is E: Solving the problem is likely the most logical.\n\nInput: When the ball left the boy's hands, his mother was surprised.

The given choices have different suggestions to fulfill the person's need of finding out a solution to hunger.\n3. Choice B 'hunt for food' suggests hunting as a possible means of satiating the hunger. \n4. Choice D 'pray' seems to be a non-specific way of satisfying the hunger as no specifics like 'ask' are explicitly mentioned.\n5. The choice C 'Gather food' is a possible need fulfilled by the neolithic man. Since we do not know for sure what kind of a solution the person might have taken for satiating his hunger,  let us try to gather as much information as possible from the context. \n6. From the earlier part of the passage, we are told that the neolithics were hunters and gatherers who used stone tools to hunt and gather what they needed.\n7. Gathering food implies that the neolithical man is still gathering what he needs to satisfy his hunger as food is one of what he needed as a hunter-gatherer.\n8. Gathering food and stone tools are all associated with the neolithic lifestyle. Since gathering food and stone tools have already been suggested, the answer should most definitely not be A 'Thank God'.\n9. Likewise, choice E \"work\" is not supported by previous information regarding stone tools as the neolithics supposedly did not have access to metal tools.\n10. We can eliminate choice A \"Thank God\" and choice E \"work\" as they do not support the information given in the previous context of the solution to the hunger of the neolithic guy and hence are not a feasible solution to satisfy the need of a neolithic guuy.\n11. Choices A 'thank God', D 'pray' and E 'work' are eliminated.\n12.

The question is asking about the neolithic period, specifically about something a \"neolithic person\" would have encountered, which is \"the problem of being hungry\".\n2. The description also hints towards the fact that religion was an important element in the neolithic times, implying that a certain level of belief about the existence of an outside \"force\" or \"god\" was present.\n3. The given options include the phrase \"God would send food\" which implies that at least some of the people were believed in the existence of such a force.\n4. Options A and D are not relevant to the query as they do not mention a person-centric action or a solution.\n5. Option E: Cook food - While cooking food can be considered a solution, it seems unlikely that the neolithic person had access to the tools they would have needed to cook properly.\n6. This could be seen as a \"last resort\" or a solution that a person would have taken only when all other options were not possible.\n7. Therefore the most likely option, especially considering the context, is D: Pray for food. (Because they relied on praying for God's blessing to get food. Hence, praying for food is a good solution to the problem of hunger, especially if no other option is available.)\nSo the final answer could be D: Pray for Food\n\nInput: His new school is a what?

Option C implies that the person hunted and obtained prey, but this does not answer the question.\n6. Option D is not relevant to the context as it refers to cannibalism, which is not a desirable or ideal way to fulfill hunger.\n7. Option, E is a possible suggestion, as it suggests that the person could have grumbled or complained about the food scarcity.\n8. However, this does not provide an answer to the question as it lacks details on how this solution would solve the problem of hunger.\n9. Option E describes that the neolithic hunk was very hungry, so they were likely to focus on trying to find any food they could even if it means eating another neolithic hunker.

The neolithic is a time when people were still gathering their food by hunting and foraging, rather than farming or growing it.\n2) The reason for their hunger was that they did not have crops or livestock to harvest food and farm it.\n3) There were no refrigerators or freezers, hence there was no food that they could keep for a long time.\n4) They had to think of quick ways to have meals or foods that would last longer.\n5) The answer could be either of the following: Cooking their foods - This would make the meals last longer and they would not be eating for a long time.  It would also be much more nutritious than eating cold foods.\nHunting for foods - This would help them to get more food than they would get otherwise and would also act as a time for them to catch up on some rest or work.\n6) However, we should be careful since some of the options sound contradictory (Cooking and hunt for foods are contradictory).\n7) The best option then would be E Cook what they gathered, it is best since it includes hunting the animal and cooking it after. \n8) It would be the safest option to use, plus it will give them the variety of food as well as the required nutrients needed.\nSo the final answers is E: cook what they have gathered\n\nInput: In her garden, Betty decided to plant some vegetables.

{"text": ": eat meat E: look for berries D: plant things \nOutput: 1- The question poses the scenario of a person in a non-urban hunting and gathering culture who needs to find food but is low on options. \n2. From the given choices, we observe that options D and E are only applicable for hunters who are looking for game. Option B refers to hunting for food in general and is therefore not applicable.\n3. If option B is not applicable, then either option A or C must be correct.\n4- Option A does not seem to fit since this could be described as a prayer rather than a solution to a problem.\n5. Option C also does not seem like a plausible solution to a food problem. This option mentions \"eating meat\" which is more aligned with a person who has a steady diet, not one who is starving. It is more likely that people would plant vegetables if they had access to gardens and had the time and energy to do so.\n6. The only option that seems to fit is option D, as they would have planted crops that could have provided sustenance during lean months.\n7. Since option D is the only plausible solution given, the correct answer is C: eat meat.\nSo the final solution is:C: eat meat", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": ": catch some trout D: eat a whole fish E: find a grocery store\nOutput: 1) First, we should consider the overall theme of the text. The text mentions that \"A person in the Neolithic Era was hungry\", so the question is likely to ask for a specific solution that one in the Neolith era would use to address hunger.2. We can see that the options provided are a mixture of modern solutions and solutions that were used in the Neolith.3. From the options, the choices that come to mind are those that are more modern and would not be considered a food solution. These include \"Eat a whole fish\" and \"Find a grocery store\".4. On the other hand, the other choices would more likely be considered solutions in the Neolith because they involve hunting or fishing.5. Therefore, the suitable choice would be \"C: Catch some trout\".\nSo the final choice is C: Catch some trouts\n\nInput: Where would an alien find tigers? Choices: 1: A: On another planet B: On the African savannah C: In the rainforest D: In the jungle E: In a zoo\nOutput: 1: Firstly, we should consider the context of the text. The question is: Where would an aliens find tigers? In this context, tigers could be considered an exotic or rare animal, and it is likely that aliens would not be able to find tigers in the same way that humans do.2: Next, we should consider the locations or environments where tigers live. The different environments where tigers can be found include the African savannah, the rainforest, the jungle and the zoo.3: Option A: 'On another planet' is not a suitable answer because aliens would not be expected to encounter tigers on an alien planet. 4: Option B: 'In the rainforest' and 'in the jungle' both refer to the tropical and humid rainforest biomes, which is a preferred habitat for tigers. So, 5: Option C: 'In the jungle' seems to be a reasonable choice.6: Option D: 'In the jaguar' is not a suitable choice because tigers are native to Asia and the", "answer": " 76"}
{"text": ": eat D: gather E: none of these were solutions\nOutput: 1) First, it's essential to clarify the context of the problem being solved. The question mentions that a \"neolithic person\" was \"hungry\" and needed to find a solution. We need to be aware of when the Neolithic Era occurred, which was from 10,000 BC to 2000 BC.\n2) We need to be aware that no one in particular is being referred to as a \"neolithics person\" but we understand that they are people living in the neolithic era that could be described as a \"neolightic person\".\n3) From the context, we can understand that a \"neolightics person\" would likely be hunter-gatherers, as the neolithic period follows the Palaeolithic Age, which primarily involves hunter-gatherer societies.\n4) Looking at the options for \"what was their solution to the problem\", we can eliminate A, \"thank god\". This is unlikely to be a solution to a hunter-gather society's problem, since they wouldn't likely have the capacity for organized religious beliefs or practices.\n5) We can similarly eliminate B, \"hunt for food\" - this doesn't seem to be an effective solution, since it wouldn't provide an immediate food source.\n6) However, \"Eat\" could be a potential solution, since it would provide an immediate solution to hunger, and is possible given the available food sources available in the Neolithic time period.\n7) Option D could be an effective solution, \"gather\", which would allow hunter-gather societies to gather food for the community to consume.\n8) Lastly, option E \"none of these were solutions\" could be interpreted as a statement that hunter-gather lifestyles did not rely on hunting and gathering food, which is correct. But it could also be an expression of the belief that there aren't any effective solutions apart from finding food using traditional hunting and gathering methods.\n9) Therefore, given the context, the answer is likely D: gather.\nSo the final solution is D: gather.\n\nInput: The sunshine warms the grass, which the sun also warms but the grass does not?

{"text": ": invent the refrigerator D: invent a fishing rod E: invent a grocery store\nOutput: 1) First, it is necessary to identify the specific type of creature in the word \"problem\".\n\n2) From the use of \"so\", we can infer that the answer will be given based on what the Neolithic people \"did\" to feed themselves, which is not \"thank God\" nor \"invent refrigerators\". \n3) The word \"prblem\" would not generally be used in casual conversation (unless said humorously). \n\n4) Looking at the choices, the \"hunt for food\" and \"invai a fishing rod\" are more commonly used expressions for hunting and fishing, which is generally what Neolithic people relied on to eat. \n\n5) Invent the \"grocery store\" or \"fish market\" seems illogical as such places were not yet invented during the Neolithic era. \n\n6) Therefore, the most likely solution to the problem is \"hunt for food\".\n\nSo the final answer are D: invent a fishmonger\n\nInput: What is one common problem with an ice cube tray? Choices:  An ice cube tray does what? A) make water B) work C) work in 2 D) make ice E) make it\n\nOutput: 1: The text says \u201cWhen an ice cube tray does not work, it usually does not work because...\u201d which indicates that we are looking for a reason that an ice cube tray doesn't work. \n2: As ice cube trays are a specific type of tray, choosing an answer from a list describing general uses of trays would be out of context for this question. \n3: The list of different uses for trays is \u201cwork in 2\u201d and \u201cmake ice\u201d, but neither of these answers fit the problem, therefore neither should be chosen. \n4: The other answers that do fit, \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cmake water\u201d, are not in a list as they both do not indicate the work of an ice cube tray, so they are eliminated as possible answers. \n5: So, from the given choices, the correct answer is B, \u201cwork in two\u201d.", "answer": " 40"}
{"text": ": cook D: forage E: plant\nOutput: 1) 'Thank god' is a phrase one speaks when trying to get through hard times but it doesn't relate to hunger so it cannot be the correct answer option.\n2) The term 'hunt' refers to the act of searching for or pursuing, which may involve preparing and cooking food, but does not directly address the problem of satisfying one's hunger. Hence, 'hunt' cannot be the correct answer choice.\n3) Cooking food involves an effort to improve the taste or appearance of food, rather than a direct solution to the issue of hunger. 'Cook' cannot be the correct option.\n4) Foraging for food involves searching for plants, animals, or other food sources in order to satisfy one's hunger, however, foraging does not necessarily include finding an actual solution to the problem. Hence, 'forage' cannot be the correct choice.\n5) Plants provide food for other animals, so plants are not directly associated with hunger, and 'plant' is not the answer option. \n6) Thus, the correct answer is 'E: plant'.\nSo the final answer would be E: plant\n\nInput: In one's life, there can be no what?

Among the mentioned answer options, the question does not give any indication that one of the following options is more likely:\n\n\"A: perfect \"could mean that one is expecting to reach an ideal state, that everything is supposed to be flawless. However, it can also mean that nothing can be perfect and there is bound to be some level of imperfection, hence we reject this option.\n\n\"B: failure \"could mean that one expects to fail. However, failure is a relative term, what for one person could be a failure, for another it could be a natural progression in their journey, so this option should be rejected.\n\n\"C: blend \"could be understood as meaning that there will be some level of mixing, or integration which could refer to the person adapting well to new situations or finding a balance.", "answer": " 220"}

They were nomadic people, who lived in tribes and were mainly engaged in farming and gathering food for survival. 2. Neolithic people lived in primitive conditions, hunted animals, gathered fruits, nuts and seeds from the land, and cooked them over fires. They were also skilled in using tools to gather and grind seeds to extract grains and tubers (starchy plant roots). 3. The prehistoric hunter-gatherers used a wide range of tools such as stone/wooden weapons, and animal skins as shields. They also developed unique methods of hunting and gathering food. The prehistoric people made use of tools such as digging sticks and scrapers as they had no sophisticated technology. 4. The options provided as solutions to the problem of hunger seem logical, but they are not necessarily the correct answers. Option A: 'thank god' - would not have been the choice for the prehistoric people at the time as they did not believe in any particular deity or religion. 5. Option B: 'hunt for food' - The prehistoric people hunted animals for food, but hunt is usually the activity of pursuing and capturing prey. The main food items included mammoths, woolly mammoths, wild asses, antelopes, wild goats, deer, wild boars and aurochs. They also had vegetarian food items such as tubers. 6. Option C: 'bake a cake' - The prehistorical people would not have understood baking a cake in the sense that we understand it today. Baking a cake was not a common practice in that time period and it is unlikely that they would have been able to do it.

It seems sensible that the user would plant grass in their backyard, as grass has a variety of benefits including environmental benefits.\n2. It also seems to create a neat, organized, and pleasant-looking backyard. \n3. Based on this, it is reasonable to assume that the user would add a flower bed as an additional option to their backyard.\n4. A flower bed requires upkeep and maintenance, so it is not a feasible option for those who want to create a low-maintenance backyard.\n5.

But it could be quite strenuous and hungry person could end up starving if he fails to hunt for food.\n4. Sharing or sharing the problem with others could be a solution. However, it would be quite difficult especially if nobody wants to share the problem in the first place or is unable to do so.\n5. Making a fire to cook food could also be a possible Solution but how would that help when person is hungry or if the food has already been cooked?\n6. Therefore, the best option would be 'D: solve their problem with the others' because this would allow the person to share the burden of the problem rather than going to solve it alone, and this would provide a temporary solution to solving the problem.\n7. Therefore the right answer would be D: solve their problem together.\nSo the final answers are D: solve their problem\n\nInput: In which of these animals are ears located on the head? Choices: 1. chinchillas 2. rabbits 3. mice 4. turtles 5. giraffes\nOutput: 1 The question is posed by asking to identify which animals are ears located on their head and it is clear that the ears are on the head of animals in the first four choices of the options given.\n2 Therefore, the answer is none of the five available options as the ears are not located on their heads.\n3 In the same way, it is not possible to answer the question as more than two animals are given to the answerer. So it is not possible to say that they are more than two animals with ears on head.\n4 The option 1 is incorrect because chinchillas do not have any ears. So the answer is incorrect.\n\nInput: The last time he went fishing was about 6 months ago.  Then what did John do?", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": eat the bark and leaves D: dig up a root E: dig uo 0 roots\nOutput: 1) The question is referring to the prehistoric or Neolithic period, when humans first started farming and domesticating animals.\n2) The question is asking about the solution that prehistoric people had to their hunger, so the options are related to food and farming methods.\n3) The answer choices are given as A) thank god, B) hunt for food, C) eat bark and leaves, D) dig up roots, and E) dig up zero roots.\n4) First, consider whether any of the options are correct.\n5) Option A: 'Thank god' does not refer specifically to food and hence is not correct.\n6) Option B: It can be inferred that prehistoric people were hunters and would have hunted animals for food. Therefore, option B could be correct, although it does not specify the type of animal or whether other methods of hunting were employed.\n7) Option C: It is possible that prehistoric people would have eaten the bark and leaves of trees as they were easily accessible. Still, this is not specific to hunger and may not have been the preferred food.\n8) Option D: Digging up roots could be viewed as a solution to hunger pangs since root vegetables can be consumed. Again, this is not specific and doesn't address the time taken to harvest or the quality of the roots.\n9) Option E: Digging up 0 roots is too vague and does not provide any additional information.\n10) Therefore, using elimination and logic, the answer is most likely to be B: Hunt for food.\nSo the final answers is B: Hunt for Food.\n\nInput: What type of fruit do you find in the rainforest?

{"text": ": create a fire D: cook the food E: plant crops\nOutput: 1 The question is about the neolithic age and the way people solved their problems during that time.\n2. Choices A, B, C, and D all speak to actions that would have taken place during the neolithic period, but E doesn't so this is the best option.\n3 In order to understand why choice E is the answer I think it's important to understand what neolithic means, which is roughly defined as relating to the Stone Age. From there we can get an idea that people hunted for food and often didn't have agricultural crops such as potatoes, carrots, or wheat. However, one thing that was available to them were seeds of various plants, such as grasses, weeds, and flowers, so they had the ability to grow or cultivate these.\n4. The question is referring specifically to the process of cooking food, so this would have been how they were able to prepare the food they hunted down.\n5. Therefore we can conclude that the answer is option E: plant crops.\nSo the final answers is E: plant crops \n\nInput: If a person is in a good mood, what does that person generally feel? Choices: 1. A: content B: calm\nOutput: 1 A person in a good mood generally feels content, they're feeling positive and happy. The word content also includes the sense of being content, and this is what a person in a good mund generally feels.\n2. B: Calsm - A person in a goodmood is usually in a calmer state, as they are enjoying their time and not generally dealing with intense situations. Calm is a word related to relaxation and tranquility, which are natural states for a person in a good, or overall pleasant, mental state.\n3. Therefore, option A is selected, because content is what a person in this mood would generally feel.\nSo the final answe is A: content\n\nInput: A big company wants to know it's customers better, what do they need to do in order to achieve this?

(They were hungry)\n2) The only option that they had at that time was to look for the food to solve this problem.\n3) The problem is food scarcity so the only option that they had to do this process is hunt, cook. And at last eat that food.\n4) The only option that can be eliminated is \"A. Thank God\" because there is no relation with the problem between that option and the problem.\n5) We can eliminate the option \"C. Cook Food\" because it has the same meaning as hunt.\n6) The best option is \" B. Hunt For Food\":\n\nSo the final answer would be B. Hunt For food\n\n1. The only option that can explain the best reason that a neolithic individual would do for finding a solution for their problems would be finding food.\n2. Hunting for food is the only choice that can justify the problem in question and explain the actions that a neolithc individual would do when faced with the problem.\n3. As a solution to a food scarcity problem, the process of \"hunting\" would come into play as the best option.\n3. The only options that are eliminated are \"A. Thank God\". Because it has no relation with the problem and \"C. Cook Food\", as it is the same process as \"Hunting\" and does not explain well what a neolithic indivdual would do when there is a problem of food scarcity.", "answer": " 75"}

B \"hunt for food\" is a common strategy to get food and is a plausible choice. C \"eat grass\" is not a common strategy for food and would not be a solution to a \"hungry\" person. D \"find some berries\" is a common strategy for food, particularly during the Middle Stone Age. Therefore, the answer could be D \"find some berry\nSo the final answer would be D: find some berry\n\nInput: In the dark, he didn't know which way to go, so he just stood there and what?

{"text": ": eat grass D: pick vegetables E: collect roots and nuts\nOutput: 1: the Neolithic period of human history is a time before tools and agriculture.\n2. Before the introduction of tools and agriculture, the Neolithic people had to rely on hunting for food and gathering wild plants for sustenance.\n3. The statement implies that the Neolithic person was in a situation where they were hungry and in need of food, and the way they solved this problem is through hunting or gathering wild plants.\n4. Therefore, we can exclude options B: hunt for Food and C: collect roots and nutes as they do not specifically refer to the solution by hunting or gathering of food..\n5. Looking at the options that remain: D: pick vegetables - This option does not specifically reference the neolithic person's solution, so it can be excluded.\n6. The remaining option is E:Collect roots and nutes as the Neolithic man was hungry, he searched for grass or something else.\n7. The answer is E:collect roots and nutes\nSo the final answer choice is E:collect roots & nutes.\n\nInput: If you don't plan your finances, you may do what?

{"text": ": hunt for fire D: hunt for shelter E: pray to gods\nOutput: 1.The question asks us to identify the neolithic people's solution for their hunger problem. 2. According to the options, \"thank god\" and \"thank god for the food\" are incorrect as these are phrases commonly used to express gratitude for what one has received, whether through divine intervention or personal efforts.\n3.\"Hunt for food\" is incorrect as hunting requires effort to chase after animals while also presenting risks like injury or death, and may not be appropriate for hungry neolithic people.\n4. \"Hunt for fire\" may be an answer as it is one common way people in history made fire.\n5. \"Hunt for shelter\" may also be an answer as it could mean looking for a place to take shelter during bad weather or search for a safe place to hunt for food during winter.\n6. However, hunting for shelter requires more effort than \"hunt for food\", and may not have been the most logical solution for a hungry neolithc person.\n7. \"Pray to gods\" may also be an option as it involves asking for gods for help, which may have been effective for a hungry neophytic person, even if it is unlikely that the person prayed directly to gods.\n8. Among the given answers, \"Pray to gods or to nature\" could possibly be the correct answer, although it may not be necessary to specify a specific group of deities when praying for help.\n9. Overall, we can conclude that \"thank god\", \"thank god for food\", \"hunt for fire\", \"hunt for food\" and \"hunt for shelter\" may not be the correct answers, and \"Pray to gods and nature\" may be the correct answer, but it is not necessary to specify a group of deities specifically. \nSo the final answer if Pray to gods and nature\n\nInput: What do scientists study to increase the yield and quality of crops such as cotton?

From here we will narrow the options down to those that are realistic/possible solutions to this problem.\n3) The options provided are as follows:\na) Thank god - this is not a realistic solution as it is unlikely that the hungry person will have access to a reliable source of food through divine intervention.\nb) Hunt for food - this is a possibility as hunting would be a way to secure food for the neolithic people, although it would involve some level of risk. \nc) Steal food - this is a possible solution as it would be an effective way to secure food without risk. However, it would be considered an immoral act in some cultures.\nd) Get a second job - this is a possible way to solve the problem, but it may not always be feasible or practical, depending on the financial situation of the hungry person.\ne) Invent a pizza - This is not a realistic or practical solution as pizza does not exist during the neolithic period.\n4) From the above we can eliminate three options.

First, we need to identify what the neolithic person is trying to achieve and the steps they need to take to solve their problem.\n2.) The question suggests that the neolithic people were hungry and wanted to grow some plants in order to solve their problem. We can infer that plant-growing is a process that takes time and cannot be done instantly.\n3.) Given that they already have food and are hungry, it may make more sense to hunt for food rather than wait for the plants they grow to start producing fruits/vegetables \n4.) Based on this reasoning, the answer is B - Hunt for food.\n5.) The neolithic people are already hungry and could hunt for food, which is a much more immediate solution to their problem than growing plants over weeks and months.\n6.) Therefore, we can conclude that the correct answer is B: Hunt for food.", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": ": pray for food D: dig for food E: find an animal to eat\nOutput: 1) The context in the question gives us the impression that the neolithic person or those belonging to the stone-age or the older days were poor and starving.\n2) One of their major sources of survival was hunting for food. This process of hunting can be termed as \"hunting for food\".\n3) Option A can be eliminated as it talks about God, so clearly, this option refers to what God would have done in this regard.\n4) Option B is also not a solution as the context suggests that they were not that lucky and hence it cannot be their solution.\n5) Option C can be ruled out because instead of praying for food, they hunted for it.\n6) Option D can also be eliminated as they were starving to death.\n7) So the option left for us is E: find an animal and eat it.\nThis was exactly what they did, and therefore our answer for the question is\nE: Finding an animal to eat\nSo the final answer we choose is E: find an\n\nInput: Who makes the best cook?

We can eliminate option 1, where we can add the answer in our options.\n2. Option 2 also does not make any sense because it is uncalled for.\n4. No we don't.\n5. Nobody knows who is a good chef.\nSince nobody knows who is good at cooking before we try it, the best cook in the world\nwho makes the perfect dishes every single time was not mentioned before the questions began.

The question mentions 'prblem', but the answer is'solution', which indicates that the answer given is the most effective and suitable solution to solve the food insecurity.\n4. Looking for shelter requires finding a stable dwelling place, which is not necessarily a quick or easy solution.\n5. Options B and D can be eliminated because they don't solve the problem of food insecurity, which is described as a \"prblem\".\n6. Option B doesn't solve the hunger of the individual because it does so indirectly through an activity.\n7. Therefore options A and E do not fit the context.\n8.

This leaves us with two options, C which is about taking part in farming, and D which is about taking part crafting.\n7.) Farming involves growing crops and producing a substantial amount of food at once rather than hunting or foraging for food.  Similarly, crafting involves creating an item that provides sustenance rather than hunting or forging for food. \n8.)

In this case, the question is specifically asking about a neolithical solution, which eliminates \"Thank God\".\n4: The neolithical age is associated with agriculture, so \"make crops\" makes the most sense. The neolithical person would have likely grown crops to survive.\n5: This eliminates options \"Making Art\" and \"planting clothes\" which are not realistic ways to solve the problem.\n6: The remaining options, \"hunting food\" and \"making clothes\", can both be considered solutions, but they are not necessarily more or less feasible than the other. If there was no crops they would look for other means to survive but this still does not make this a neolithic response as we are looking for specifically neolithic behaviors.  If our neolithic man is desperate, he would most likely hunt for food as this would probably be more likely to be a means of survival. However, the question specifically asks about neolithic ways of solving problems.\n7: Thus, the response to the question is D: Plant food\nSo the final answer to is D: Plant food.\n\nInput: Someone wants to be an ariist, but he lacks one of two things.

The options provided are:\na. Thank God - This option does not speak to a hungry neolithic person, thus cannot be related to the hunger felt\nb. hunt for food - The option of hunting for food implies searching and finding food. However, in terms of time and resources, hunting requires more effort, which a 'hungry' neolithic person might not have, especially as it took time to develop tools used to hunt\nc. Kill an animal - The option of killing an animal is similar to hunting, however, this could be more difficult due to lack of needed tools. If a neolithic person could not find food, they might not be able to hunt or kill an animal\nd. Gather - This is the most plausible option as gathering food is a more viable solution than hunting or killing. There are several choices the neolilthic people could resort to such as fruits or nuts that could be easily found.\n3. Based the context and reasoning, an option 'Gather' is most likely to be the solution to the problem of how the \"neolithic\" person deals with their hunger.\nSo the final Answer is D: gather\n\nInput: Drew was in a hurry to the party, and he was also in the rush to prepare for what?

The provided answer choices are:\na. work - This seems plausible however it refers to preparing to go to work. The question specifically states 'party'.\nb. Apparently - The context does not provide information to specify the reason for preparing for the party. The term \"hurrying to a party\" could reflect on his dress, and the time pressure to get ready.\nc. the party - Here, the party is mentioned specifically as the reason to prepare for something.

We can eliminate the option build house.\n7) Build house can be used to create shelter, but a neolithic house was probably constructed from available materials at the time, and not necessarily used to solve a problem of survival as one of the options describes it.\n8) Option A: work in the field is the correct answer, as it describes the neolithic person's strategy for obtaining food by planting and tilling the soil.\nSo the final answers are A: work in the Field\n\nInput: You bought a piece of real estate because you wanted a vacation spot, the property was what?

{"text": ": look for something else D: eat something else E: find a vegetable\nOutput: 1) The context implies that the question is referring to the neolithic person, who was presumably hungry.\n2) We must also note that this person is living in a time period called \"neolithic.\" \n3) Neolithic is a term used to refer to the final phase of the \"stone-age\" era in human history, which is primarily associated with the beginning of agriculture and civilization.\n4) With this context, we can interpret the question as \"how did the neolithic people find their solution to the food shortage problem?\"\n5) We can examine the given options as follows:\n(a) \"Thank god\" is a phrase that may indicate a belief in a higher power, but it would not have been feasible for the neolithic persons to have this type of belief system or to rely on divine intervention.\n(b) \"Hunt for food\" refers to seeking out or looking for food, which may have been a common practice for the neolithics foraging and hunting for game to obtain food.\n(c) \"Look for something else\" is a vague and unclear option, and could be interpreted as finding alternative food sources or seeking other foods. However, it does not offer specifics on what the neolithic might have done in this instance.\n(d) \"Eat something else\" could potentially be the neolithic solution to the food shortages they faced, as the phrase \"eat something else\" can have various meanings in context and doesn't need to be exclusively used to refer to eating non-neolithic foods or different types of meals.  In this case, it can also be used in reference to eating other neolithic foods such as other types of cooked meat, or even cooked plants. \n(e) \"Find a vegetable\" has a direct relation to agriculture and the neolithics, as it would imply that they had crops and were familiar with growing and harvesting plants. Therefore, they had a solution that aligned well with their society and could have been the most feasible option at that time.\n6) Therefore, taking into account of this, the answer is E, \"find a vegetable.\"\nSo the final answer in E", "answer": " 70"}
{"text": ": make up meal D: make a fire E: try again next day\nOutput: 1) A neolithic person is \"hungry.\" This tells us that one or more meals have not been successfully captured for the day. The neolithic solution is not a problem of lack, but one of inefficiency and, therefore, a mismanagement at the outset. \n2) The statement is ambiguous as to what exactly the hunter achieved or achieved what in relation to his goal: to bring home enough food for an evening meal. Did he successfully capture any game, or did he capture none?\n3) The statement indicates a solution in the form of retrying tomorrow. This does not necessarily address the hunter\u2019s lack of success with capturing games. It indicates that there is a belief that his tactics will work and not lack of success in his attempt.\n4) Fire was not discovered by man until later in his history. Making a meal is too long of a process to complete with fire.\n5) In this context, it does not make sense to thank God nor to hope for a better tomorrow, as there was not a lack of food. Fire is not likely to be the neolithic person\u2019s solution, as it was not discovered until much later in history.\n6) Of the options, it appears that making a meal would be the appropriate option.\n7) So the answer to this question is D: making a meal.\nSo the final sentence would be \"The neolithic person tried making a meal, but it wasn't enough.

{"text": ": take leftovers D: eat fruit E: go get more\nOutput: 1 This question refers to the Neolithic period in human history, a time when people began to domestiicate animals and form agricultural societies. Hunting for food was a major part of their daily lives, and it was done not only for survival, but also for pleasure and sustenance.\n2 One way the Neolithic person could have solved their hunger problem was by hunting for food. While they hunted for specific animals, such as deer or boar, they also hunted for any edible animals they could find.\n3 Another way the Neolithical person could have solved their problem is by scavenging leftovers. The Neolithic people would often take leftovers or scraps from hunting, gathering, or making other things.\n4 The Neolithical person may have also eaten fruit to solve their problem with hunger. Many fruits were available during the Neolithic era, including figs, dates, apples, nuts, berries, and more. \n5 Eating fruit was only one of many possible solutions the Neolithic people had for their hunger problem. They also had several ways to gather food, including the hunting, scavenging, and the gathering of plants and animals.\n6 The answer is Option B: hunt for some food\nSo the final answer in A:hunt for food and E: got more food\n\nInput: If you are a gardener, what is a good resource for ideas on the subject?

{"text": ": create fire D: grow crops E: pray for rain\nOutput: 1- The Neolithic period is marked by the use of hunter-gathering and agriculture as prominent methods of food production, as opposed to the nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle of hunter-gathers and previous cultures of Paleolithic hunters. As a result, the Neolithic person would have possessed a greater skill set related to agriculture and farming.\n2- Option a \u201cthank god\u201d refers to the concept of divine intervention and omnipotence, which is not applicable in this context.\n3- Option B \u201chunt for food\u201d refers to hunting as a method of food production, which in the Neolithic period, may not have been a viable option due to the increase in populations, the rise of agriculture, and the shift towards a sedentary lifestyle. Instead, it could have been more suitable for this individual to grow crops.\n4- Option C \u201ccreate fire\u201d refers to the use of fire as a method of food preparation and cooking, which may not necessarily be relevant in the context of the individual being hungry. The most likely solution in this case is Option D \u201cgrew crops\u201d.\n5- Option E \u201cpray for rain\u201d does not seem to be a logical solution to the problem as it does not directly relate to food production or agriculture.\n6- Option D \u201cgrow crops\u201d would have been a much more suitable solution for the individual who was hungry to satisfy their hunger.\nSo the final is option D \u201cgrow cropped\u201d\n\nInput: Do you have a suggestion?

{"text": ": make a cave D: make a fire E: start a village\nOutput: 1) The context of the question focuses on a \"neolithic person\", who we can infer was living during the Neolithic Age. The Neolithic Era is defined by the domestication of plants and animals and the development of agriculture. Based on this information, the person is likely struggling with food scarcity or a lack of food resources.\n\n2. To tackle the problem of food scarcity, options A and B, such as \"thanking God\" or hunting for food, are not sustainable solutions as they do not address the underlying issues of food scarcity.\n\n3. Option C implies \"making a cave\" to find shelter and safety, but this does not directly address the problem of food scarcities either.\n\n4. \"Making a fire\" (option D) may be useful to provide warmth and cook food, but it does not necessarily address the issue of food scarcity directly.\n\n5. \"Starting a village\" (option E) implies creating a permanent settlement that can house people, but this does not necessarily address the problems with food scarcity either.\n\nIn conclusion\n\n6.

{"text": ": kill and eat someone D: farm E: dig for grains\nOutput: 1 First, we can eliminate options A and B as they do not provide any information about hunting and are too general.\n2. Option C \"kill and eat someone\" is a plausible solution, but it may be too direct or violent for the neolithic person.\n3. Options D \"farm\" and E \"dig for grains\" are more specific to agricultural activities, but would not have been available to a person in the neolithic era.\n4. Option D \"farm\" could have taken place later in human history, but it would not have been possible for a person in the neoithic era which is the context here.\n5. Now, we are left with options B and C as more specific and relevant based on the context.\n6. From the options provided, it can be inferred that the neolithic people relied on hunting for food.\n7. They may have hunted wild animals, but it is unlikely that they would have killed and eaten another person, which is why option C is the correct answer.\n8. There was a lack of a system to cultivate grains at the time, so digging grains would have been a less likely solution.\n9. Thus, \"option C: hunt for food\" is the correct answer here.\nSo the final\n\nInput: He ate something so what was he feeling?

Being happy is likely to be associated with younger age, which is not mentioned in the question. Therefore, options A, D and E are eliminated.\n2: It is not correct to say that being in love is associated with the age as love can appear at any age. Hence, option A is eliminated.\n3: Sadness is an emotion that can appear at any age, hence options A, D, and E are eliminated, along with option B for being too general.\n4: Happiness is often associated with age.

Choices A: mathematics B: programming C: photography D: writing E: drawing\nOutput: 1 We can assume that the question is asking about an individual who is a good problem-solver and creative, and the question is related to their preferred activity or pursuit.\n2. Mathematics involves a lot of logical thinking and calculations, and can require creativity to solve complex problems. Some people may enjoy working with numbers.\n3. Programming requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills, as well as the ability to think creatively to develop new programs.\n4. Photography requires creativity and problem-solving to capture different perspectives and angles.\n5. Writing and drawing also involve creative thinking and problem-solving. However, these options are not as closely aligned with the previous options as mathematics and programming.\n6. Given the context of the question, the answer is more likely to be D: writing.\n7.

The option that is most likely to result from the petition is that there will be 1001 student taking action.\n2. This choice is based on the context of 1000+ students signing a petition to take action on an issue or event.\n3. The other choice options are not likely to result from the signing of the petition.\n4. These choices are based on the context of the petition being used to organize and motivate a demonstration or protest.\n5. As a result, the answer is most likely to be a demonstration or protest by 1000 student, so B. protest and D. a demonstration would be the correct answer. \nBut the best answer is E: demonstration as it is more general and will fit a larger number of students and events while still being a logical option given the context", "answer": " 13"}

In fact, this is the least likely of all the other solutions mentioned.\n5.We can say that 'cooking and eating', 'fishing' or 'hunt for food' would best match the context. 'Cooking and eating', in particular, is the least likely as we don't know the exact reason for the people's hunger.\n6.

Other options: find berries, find nuts: These options are more of like a plan but not a solution. \n5. The solution doesn't involve plans.\n6. Therefore, 'eating' stands out from the other options.\n7.

When the options are all types of pets, then the answer will be from those few options.\n3. Other options are too generic and not specific to animals.\n4. Hence the answer will always be from the few options available.\n5. The first option \"A tiger\" seems like a fun and interesting pet but not in the context of the question.\n6.

Hunting for food, going to different places for food, and thanking god are not solutions to their hungry state and can't be the correct answers.\n3. Therefore, the answer to the question should likely be to - kill animals - since this is a solution that neolithic people used to get food.\n4. Looking for more information about neolithic culture, we can find out that the solution to their hungry problems was to kill animals and eat them.\n5. Therefore the answer to the question would be D: kill animals.\nSo the final answers are D: kill animals\n\nInput: A friend is going to the zoo, the friend is a lover of animals, but he/she is on what? Choices: A: a vacation E: a school fieldtrip B: a business trip D: a journey C: a vacations\nOutput: 1) To answer this question, we need to understand what a 'friend' is and what a 'zoo' is.\n2. 'Friend' is a noun that refers to a person who you know well and like a lot, someone who understands you and helps you, a person who you love, or a person that you spend a lot of time with.\n3. 'Zoo' is a verb that refers to a specific time period when you spend less time with people because you have to work.\n4. Based on the definition of 'friend' and 'zoo', we can clearly understand that a friend is someone you spend a lot of your time with, which makes them an unlikely candidate for a zoo trip.\n5. A'school fieldtrip' is a type of trip to a museum or someplace of interest that is organized by the school as part of the education curriculum. This usually happens during the day when there is no school.\n6. A 'business trip' is not related to zoo animals. Instead, it refers to a trip for a job interview, a business conference, a sales trip, or a visit to a manufacturing plant.\n7. A 'journey' is a trip that lasts one day or more. This kind of trip could have a", "answer": " 150"}
{"text": ": ask a friend D: pray E: wait\nOutput: 1) The question asks about a situation in which a character from the Neolithic period (known as the Stone Age) is \"hungry.\"\n2) The options given are the possible solutions that person might have used to solve their problem.\n3) Option A, which could be interpreted as thanking God, is not necessarily related to the context of getting food and would be unreasonable in this situation.\n4) Option B, which could be taken to mean \"hunt for food,\" is a reasonable solution to the problem, but other options also fit the context, so B is not the correct answer.\n5) option C \"ask a friend\" is a potential solution to the problem, though it may not have been a common practice during the Neolithic era, and it doesn't necessarily provide an alternative to getting food.\n6. Option D \"pray\" is an indirect way of getting food. This option can also have a relation to the question of the Neolithic person being \"hungry\".\n7. Option D is an ambiguous solution, so it is ruled out.\n8. Option E \"wait\" which could be interpreted as not acting until food arrives is also ambiguous, so it is excluded.\n9. Therefore a logical answer to the question's context is option D \"pray\".\n10. However, option D could also be interpreted as talking to God. If this is the case, we could also reasonably conclude that the Neolithic character asking a friend could be considered an alternative to saying a prayer.\n11. So D is not only one option, but also covers an alternative.\n12. Therefore the best answer is a combination of D and C.\nSo the correct answer is D and C: prayer and asking a friend\n\nInput: He had 12 bottles and he was hungry.  He could either A: feed himself or B: share one with his buddy\nOutput: 1.) The question states that the character \"had 12 bottles\" and was \"hungry\" which implies that he would need to consume the bottles or their contents in order to satisfy his need for food.\n2.) The options presented (A Feed and B \"share 1 with his buddy\") have slightly different interpretations of how the character can satisfy", "answer": " 125"}
{"text": ": pray D: seek refuge E: make a fire \nOutput: 1) The first thing we notice is the context in which the choice are given, which is to \"solve the problem\". \n2) Since the solution is given by the 'neolithic person', we can assume the time period they're from or are inspired by. \n3) The choices provided then suggest that the \u200b\u200b'neolithic person' may be looking for a solution to a food problem, most likely by hunting or seeking for food.\n4) 'Hunt' can be interpreted as searching for food through direct action, while 'pray' could be associated with seeking support or guidance in finding food. \n5) 'Seek refuge' could be a way to protect from the threat of starvation and'make a fire' could be a technique to provide warmth and cook food, which is another solution to the food problem.\n6) All in all, the choice that best reflects the context of the question is C: pray. \n7) The term 'prblem' in the question may give the impression that the neolithic person is seeking to address a problem of famine, which is further strengthened by the context of seeking refuge.\n8) Thus, the most suitable answer to the question is C: Pray.\nSo the final choice is C: Pray\n---\n\n## 60.

He's already taken it, we'll leave it there in case  ____? Choices:  I've it  I'll have it  I've had it  I'd it  ____ have it \nOutput:  This question is focused around understanding the correct form of \"It's mine.\" in a specific context. We need to follow the structure of the sentence to correctly find the answer.\n1. The structure of the sentence is: \"It's mine and I\"m taking it, you/she's gonna lose it, he's already taken it\". From this structure, we can infer that \n2. The word 'it' refers to something that is'mine' in the future", "answer": " 736"}
{"text": ": starve D: leave E: plant\nOutput: 1) The word 'The' is an adverb which shows that the writer refers to 'a solution to the problem' in general, while 'neolithic person' is the subject of the sentence. The neolithic people might have been the hunters, hunted for food or even left but planting cannot be the real answer because it's out of their control. We can see hunt for food, starve and plant as the other options, so hunt for food is a more likely solution for the question.\n\n2) Hunting might be a solution for the problem, but in the question, the neolithic person is hungry. So, we can consider that the person might have hunted for food that will not be sufficient to feed the whole people. Hence, a general solution for the situation is planting.\n\nSo the final answer will be B: hunt for.\n\nInput: The teacher tried to make the class understand.  The students are unmotivated.  Teacher wants to  what? Choices: A: cheer them up B: get even C: get the students motivated D: make better E: make them feel worse\nOutput: The question is based on context and has a lot of information. We can start with the first part: \"Teacher tried to make the classroom understand\" which means the teacher is trying to teach something to the class.\nThe next part tells us the students are unmotivaded which means the teacher can't get through to the students and can't teach them well. \nNext part is \"Teacher wants to\" which means the teacher wants to make the class understand something which means the teacher wants them to succeed.\nThe next part, \"get even\" does not make sense in the context of the situation, as the teacher is not teaching them things in order to be able to get even with them or with anyone. \n\"make better\" does not seem to make sense in the context as it also refers the teacher wants the class to improve in general and that does not seem to be the purpose of the teacher. \n\"make them feel worse\" does not make sense either as the teacher is trying to get them out by teaching them something and that is what he is trying to do.\nSo, it does make sense to go with \"make them feel better\"", "answer": " 1140"}
{"text": ": pray D: ask for help E: look for plants\nOutput: 1) First, we need to identify the issue/problem the neolithic person is facing.\n2) We are told that the neolithic man is hungry, which could be a problem that arises at certain points of time given the limited resources and agricultural capabilities during that period. \n3) Looking at the statements -'so what was their solution to your problem' - it seems that the solution lies in the options being provided. \n4) The solution isn\u2019t an event, so we can discount option A.\n5) Option B: \u2018hunt for food\u2019 \u2013 This doesn't sound too logical, given that the neolithics didn't have enough hunting capabilities to meet their food needs. \n6) Option C 'Pray' - It makes little sense given the context and could potentially be disregarded \n7) Option D 'ask for help' - This solution sounds logical, given the context. However, looking at how the problem started - as they found themselves to be too hungry to gather food - it can be said that the help they need comes in the form of gathering food and not asking for help per se, but to solve their hunger pangs.\n8) Option E 'Look for plants' - This solution sounds reasonable considering the context where the person found themselves too hungry to gather their daily food. \n9) Given the options, the most logical solution to the problem - 'ask for help' to gather food - makes little sense given the person\u2019s own skill and knowledge to gather food to meet their daily needs.\n10) Taking all the clues and hints in the context and the options into consideration, the most logical solution seems to align with the option 'E: look for plants' given that it\u2019s relatively easy and efficient to do so.\nSo the final answers is E: look for plants", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": ": pray to god D: cook food E: talk to god\nOutput: 1) Option A: \"thank god\" is not an appropriate answer as a solution to anything, let alone hunger. It is merely an expression of thanks and gratitude. \n2)Option B: \"hunt for food\" is a solution that could be given to a neolithic person struggling with hunger, as they had the tools and resources needed to find and prepare food.\n3)Option C: \"pray to god\" could be a solution if the neolithic person believed in a higher power and had faith that they would be provided for.\n\n4)Option D: \"cook food\" is an accurate solution since the neolithic period was marked by a shift to cooked food as opposed to raw ingredients, along with the development of food processing and storage techniques.\n\n5)Option E: \"talk to god\" is not a specific solution but could be an ongoing action or part of a solution. The neolithic period saw the rise of various civilisations, some of which centered around religion and spirituality, so talking to a higher power may have been a part of their solution to hunger or other problems they faced.\n\n6)Therefore, the answer would likely include one or more of options B, D, and/or E.\nSo the final answers are likely to be B, D, or E", "answer": " 36"}
{"text": ": ask for help D: pray E: pray for rain\nOutput: 1) Option C is definitely not what they did, since there is no reference to this at all.\n2) Option A probably is what they did, because it says thank god, which they would probably have done in that time.\n3) Option A probably was done, but they still might have had to ask for help if the hunting was not successful, and if the hunting was not successfully in the first place, their praying might have gone unanswered.\n\nSo the final answer should be C - to ask for help\n\nInput: How do some people feel about living in a big city?

{"text": ": pray D: grow vegatables E: kill it and eat\nOutput: 1 In the neolithic era, people were mostly reliant on hunting and gathering for their survival, rather than farming. \n2. The term \"prblem\" is used, suggesting that the problem was food scarcity, rather than a personal problem. \n3. The solution \"to the prblem\" would likely refer to a collective action or a general activity, rather than an individual action.\n4. Looking away the given options: 'Thank god' - This option refers to expressing gratitude or thankfulness towards a higher power, but that's not necessarily aligned with the prblem at hand.\n'Hunt for food' - refers to a specific type of activity and seems more suitable as an individual action than a collective one. \n'Pray' - relates to appealing to a higher power, but again, is not necessarily tied to solving a prblem. \n'Grow vegatables' - is the most appropriate solution to a food prblem, as it suggests a collective or community-driven activity, in which people grow their own food, rather than hunting for wild animals or killing them to eat. \n'Kill it and eat' refers to individual action rather than a collective action and is not an ideal solution for a prblem of food scarcity.\n5. Therefore the option E - grow vegatables is the correct answer.\nSo the final action is E: grow vegatables\n\nInput: What is the point of a ridgepole? Choices: 1.

{"text": ": kill animals D: build a fire E: eat berries\nOutput: 1., The question is referring to a specific problem that people faced in the past (hungry) and suggesting possible solutions (build a fire).\n2. Build a fire could be one solution to such a problem as it involves cooking the food and warming up the body, while hunting for food or eating berries would not achieve both purposes.\n3. Looking at the options: A. thanking God could refer to a spiritual belief or practice of expressing gratitude, which may or may not help solve hunger problems. B. hunting for food can be a solution to a hunger problem, but it does not guarantee cooking the food or warming up the body.\n4. C. killing animals can be a solution to hunger problems, but it does not necessarily result in cooked or warmed-up food.\n5. D. Building a fire can be a solution to the problem of hunger, as it involves cooking and warming up the food. Therefore, the answer to the question is D: Build a fire.\nSo the final answers is D: Build a Fire\n\nInput: Some people enjoy living in what climate?

Each climate offers different experiences and benefits, and people may have their own preferences based on their needs and preferences.\n3. There is no single \"correct\" answer as it depends on the individual's preferences and needs.\n4. There is more information given regarding \"the tropics\" including the possibility of warmth, high temperatures, tropical plants and animals, and abundant rainfall, which could make it a desirable climate to live in for some people.\n5. Looking at the given options, \"the tropical climate\" is the only option that specifically mentions the possibility of warmth and high temperatures, which may make it a more appealing climate to some individuals.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer for option 1 in this scenario is \"the tropics.\"\nSo the final answer for the question is the", "answer": " 27"}
{"text": ": go to bed early D: get up at dawn and have an early meal E: don't complain\nOutput: 1) The question asks us about the Neolithic person's solution to the feeding problem, which we can understand to mean they were hungry.\n2) The choices also provide clues to narrow down our possible answers.\n3) Option A \"thank god\" makes little sense as the question is about a solution being applied by someone, implying that they are the one in need of it.\n4) Option B \"hunt for food\" gives the impression that the solution would involve hunting for their mealtime food\n5) Option C \"go to bed early\" would be more to the liking of the Neolithic people given they had to go hunting to find their food, perhaps they could do the same in seeking solutions.\n6) Option D \"get up at dawn and have and early meal\" sounds more appropriate for ancient times, suggesting the solution would be something they already used in their daily routine\n7) Option E \"don't complain\" is not a plausible answer as the question asks of a solution they had applied.\n8) From the given choices, it seems like solution C \"go to bed\" fits the context of the question well.\n9) Therefore, given the context and the choices given, the choice would be C: go to bed.\nSo the final choice is C: go to bed\n\nInput: I am in need of what to write my college term paper?

The term \"hunters\" is also mentioned, which is associated with hunting.\n4 The person could use \"a net\" specifically, but its ambiguity raises significant doubt about its suitability as the correct answer. \n5 Option A \"thank god\" is a phrase used to express gratitude and it doesn't necessarily convey what the person needs for survival. Option C \"pray for assistance\" may refer to a prayer directed toward a higher power or deity which doesn't necessarily convey how they will obtain the food they need for survival, thus cannot be the ideal answer.\n6 Option D \"kill\" is a solution that a person may resort to if they have no other alternatives. However, if killing other animals for food is morally or ethically not acceptable to the individual who is going through hunger, then this answer cannot be considered.\n7 The context suggests that the person is not a hunter or a hunter group, as the person is referred to as \"neolithic\" which indicates that it is a \"time era.\" The person is also described as \"hungry.\" \"Hunting\" is an activity done by predators such as animals or animals hunters. The person is a hunter, and thus, would likely not be hungry or need hunting unless the context indicates otherwise.\n8 Option E \"use a net like a bag\" is vague and does not convey the kind of specifics a person starving as a neolithic hunter will need to survive.\n9 In summary, the neolithic hunters are a prey species whose forebears are known to resort to cannibalism for survival.\n10 Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C 'pray for assistance' due being the most apt answer which can be drawn based on context provided in the question.\nSo the final answers are C: pray for assistance\n\nInput: He knew how his company made", "answer": " 250"}

Option A. \u201cThank god\u201d \u2014  The use of the word \u201cgod\u201d implies that this option does not provide a valid explanation for why the neolithic person would find its solution.\n5. Option b. \u201chunt for food\u201d \u2014 The word \u201cfor food\u201d does not provide a necessary explanation of why the neolithics person would find its solution, since it does not address the original dining issue presented.\n6) Option c. \u201chunt for dinner\u201d \u2014  The word \u201cfor dinner\u201d does not provide a possible solution to the hunger issue, since dinner is generally a meal that is consumed only after the sun has gone down.\n7) Option D. \u201cpray\u201d \u2014 The word \u201cpray\u201d generally refers to an act of supplication to a higher power.\n8) Option E. \u201cgo hunting\u201d \u2014 The word \u201chunt\u201d appears to be an unambiguous indication that the answer options refers to obtaining food or prey from the natural environment.\n9) With all that in mind, the word \u201cdinner\u201d in the options refers to food consumed later in the evening and indicates that a solution to the food issue had been found.\n10) The neolithic era typically refers to a time marked by the development of food-gathering techniques. As a result, the solution may have entailed the gathering of food.\n11) Therefore, the best explanation for how the neolithic age discovered food is option E. \u201cgo hunting.\u201d\nSo the final answer should be E: go hunting.\n\nInput: Her body had a lot of what?

{"text": ": go to the market D: plant seeds E: build a dam\nOutput: 1) Neolithic peoples primarily relied on hunting and gathering techniques, as evidenced by the absence of crops and farming practices during this era.\n2) They had little access to large game, so they focused on smaller animals like rabbits, small rodent and birds.\n3) In response to hunger, Neolithic peeps likely went on small expeditions to try and capture some of this wildlife. \n4. Neolithic Peoples also hunted more frequently as the weather got colder. This was likely to ensure that they had the resources necessary to stay warm.\n5. It is also important to note that many Neolithic people may have settled into the same area for their entire lives, so hunting would likely have been a crucial element of their food supply.\n6. Given, from the provided options: Option A 'thank god\"  is not a practical solution,  B 'hunt for food' is similar to a practical solution to hunt for food. So this doesn't make sense.\n7. Option D 'plant seeds' is a general practice that could not be applied to all food sources. Furthermore, planting crops requires knowledge of farming practices and fertilization techniques that were likely not common during the Neolithic era.\n8. Option E 'build a dam' is inaccurate because building dams during this time period was not a common practice and would not have been part of the solution to hunger.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: hunt for food.\nSo the final explanation is C: hunt\n\nInput: All cats have what kind of fur?

{"text": ": eat D: grow E: live\nOutput: 1.This would be a sentence style question.\n2. The options given here could have been used by neolithic people to solve the problem at hand.\n3. Option A: 'Thank God' - This would be an extremely unlikely solution to the problem of hunger for a neolithic person. They didn't know or believe in any higher beings; so, thanking any deity would be highly unlikely.\n4. Option B: 'Hunt for food' - This would be a likely solution to the problem of food scarcity, given the time period and culture of the neolithic people.\n5. Option C: 'Eat' - Eating leftover food could have been a solution to the problem, but only if there was any available; hence, this would most likely be the outcome of 'hunt for food'.\n6. Option D: 'Grow' - The option 'grow' is a little ambiguous and could be referring to growing food or being taller. Either way, it gives a direct solution to the problem at hand which is to be hungry.\n7. Option H: 'Live' - The option 'live' seems to be referring to the general existence of a human being.\n8.

This may be relevant in the neolithic time period, given agriculture is a prominent feature of this society.\n6) Option D \"Gather food\" is similar to \"grow their own\" and indicates that a hungry individual may gather food instead of growing their own. \n7) Option E \"pray\" doesn't have anything to do with the context of the question.\n8) Based on the above reasons, a possible answer could be D: Gather food.\nSo the final and correct answer is D: gather food\n\nInput: Which of these would have been easy for someone from a different culture? Choices: 1: Traveling by ferry 2: Living in a large house 3: Sailing 4: Building a boat 5: Riding a horse 6: Driving a tractor 7: Walking across the desert 8: Living in an apartment with a lift \nOutput: \n1. The question is about cultural adaptation. \n2. Considering cultural variations, not all people would have found traveling by ferries easy, as some cultures may find riverboats more convenient or comfortable for their specific needs and habits. \n3. There are different options, but since we are looking at which of these actions would be easy for someone from a culture different than the one where the question was asked, it is likely that this person would not have traveled on a ferry.\n4.

{"text": ": take to hiking D: start the first city-state society E: dig wells\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" is referring to a person or group of people in the early stages of human development, who shifted from a nomadic and hunting lifestyle to one of agriculture and settlement.\n2.The question asks us to identify the solution to the problem of hunger faced by the \"neolithic\" person.\n3.Given the context and the options provided, the answer is clearly D \"start the first city-state -society\". This is the most likely answer because:\n\n3.1.In the early stages of human existence, societies were not organized. They were primarily hunter-gatherer societies and, more rarely, nomadic tribes or city-states.\n3.2.This context excludes other solutions, such as hiking (for pleasure or exercise) or thanking god as the solution to the problem.\n3.3.\"Dig wells\" is not a plausible solution because digging wells is not a solution to the specific problem of being hungry, but rather to addressing a lack of water. This solution is not necessarily applicable to the early stages of human history.\n3.4.It is also not a logical option as a solution to the issue of hunger because wells would need to be dug first, which they wouldn't have been in the time frame of that period.\n\n4.So, the answer is likely D.\nSo the final answers are D: start the first City-state society\n\nInput: Why would the person with low blood pressure experience less dizziness?

{"text": ": trade food D: pray E: do magic\nOutput: 1) The question requires us to understand the mindset of Neolithic people, which were primarily hunter-gatherers.\n2) The answer options are presented in the form of what these people are likely to do in a situation where they are hungry, which we can infer from the provided context.\n3) The first option given 'thank God' doesn't exactly have anything to do with the context.\n4) Option 'do magic' also cannot be correct because magical solutions were not widely practiced in the Neolithic era. This option should be ruled out.\n\n5) Option B 'hunt for food' seems plausible as Neolithic people were hunters by trade. This fits the option well. \n6) Option C 'trade food' could be an option as trade is something that would have been practiced by Neolithic people. However, the answer doesn't explicitly mention food-to-food trades.\n7) Option E 'pray' could also be an appropriate answer. Praying is an act of asking for something, which is fitting as the description mentions people being hungry.\n\n8) Therefore, from these two options, the answer is likely D: pray.\nSo the final option is D: pray\n\nInput: It\u2019s time to make a change of scenery.

{"text": ": make something to eat D: try to find edible stuff E: be more resourceful\nOutput: 1) The neolithic individual is described as being \"hungry\" and seeking a solution to the problem.\n2) The solutions provided by the choices relate to various approaches to sourcing food, including hunting, creating food items or finding edible sources.\n3) The options do not mention any specific solutions related to food preparation, so it seems that the solution was more focused on sourcing food rather than its preparation.\n4) In terms of the language used in the question, the options provided seem to use general words throughout, such as \"hungry\" or \"solution,\" rather than specifically referring to a particular type of food or preparation.\n5) Looking at the options, it seems that hunt for food and try to find edible sources are most closely aligned with the context of the question and the possible solutions provided. These would be the top two options that meet the criteria.\n6) However, there is room for further analysis and determination of which of the two options is more likely to be the correct response as per the provided context.\n7) In this case, if the neolithic person had access to hunting and their intent was to find edible sources, it seems that they would have used hunting as the primary strategy.\n8) This is because hunting would have been the more efficient means of sourcing food compared to simply trying to find edible sources. \n9) Hunting would allow a person to not only acquire more food than they would be able to by simply searching for edible sources, but it would also provide them with a more reliable and consistent supply of food.\n10) Therefore, it seems that the most likely option is C: hunt for food.\nSo the final option is C: hut for food\n\nInput: Who in their right mind would ever say something like:  I have found the cure for world hunger, I don't what you say but why don't you just eat?

So hunting for food in that time period when agriculture was not established, seems unlikely.\n5) Option C: Cultivation of food is a reasonable solution for food security issues in the neolithic period. However, this option implies that the neolithic people learnt about cultivation and started doing it which may not be the case as this solution requires human knowledge and effort.\n6) Option D: Eating wild plants is a viable solution in the context but doesn\u2019t necessarily imply a complete or comprehensive solution to food scarcity.\n7) Option E: \u2018Dig up plant seeds\u2019 can be a solution but it doesn\u2019t explicitly indicate whether all plant seeds were dug up, or if the dug-up seeds grew into new plants.\n8) Therefore, from the provided choices the solution that fits best in the context is option D: eat wild plants.\nSo the final solution is D: eat wild plants\n\nInput: The bonsai is a dwarf tree in an ornamental pot, what is it growing toward?

{"text": ": plant crops D: catch fish E: gather resources\nOutput: 1.We are provided with the context of the Neolithic person being hungry, which means they have an issue with food supply.\n2. We can analyze the characteristics of each answer option given.\n3. Option 'A' - Is a solution that doesn't necessarily relate to food supply and could have been a solution to another problem that they were facing.\n4. Option 'B' - Is a solution based on hunting for food, which sounds reasonable until we think about how we know that the Neolithic People were living at the time they are being described and if they had the technology to hunt down animals.\n5. Option 'C' - is based on planting crops to increase food supply, which sounds like a viable solution, but this is a more modern idea that the Neolithics wouldn't know as they did not have the technology to do that back then.\n6. Option 'D' - is based on catching fish, which could also be a viable solution.\n7. Option 'E' - is based on gathering resources, which could also be applied to food supply but it does not specifically relate this to the problem of starvation.\n8. Therefore, the answer that best fits the context and characteristics of the options is 'D': catch fish. \n9. Fishing is a viable option to gather food and increase supply without requiring technology that was not available to the Neolithic people.\nSo the final  answer is D 'catch fish'.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Grades:\n\n1. 10/10\n2. 6/10\n3. 8/10\n4. 7/10\n5. 7/11\n\n### Total grade:\n\n71%\n\n### Earned score for this quiz: 40/40\n\n### You can always go and do the first quiz again.

The problem they had at hand was food scarcity, and the options given are related to different courses of action that could have been taken.\n3) Option A: Thank god: This option provides a short-term solution, but it does not address the underlying problem of food scarcity. It does not mention when or how the food is obtained, which makes it less feasible.\n4) Option B: Hunt for food: This is a potential solution to the problem of food scarcity, but it does not take into account other factors such as safety, time, and the availability of resources.\n5) Option C: Starve: This, of course, is an extreme measure that is unlikely to be chosen by anyone, but it emphasizes the dire nature of the situation and perhaps highlights that the other solutions provided may not be sufficient to solve the problem of food scarcities.\n6) Option D: Hunt: This is a more specific suggestion than hunt for food and it hints at certainty in hunting which means that this is also unlikely to be the answer given the context.\n7) Option E: Pray: This is a spiritual course of action, but it does not help solve the problem of scarcity. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the answer.\n8) From the given options and the contextual information given, the most likely answer is \"Option D: Hunter\": It's clear that the chosen course of action would be to hunt.\nSo the final option is D: Hunter\n\nInput: I used to play football and I also play soccer, what sport do I mainly play?

Based on the context of the question, we can conclude that the'solution' referred to is likely to be a strategy used by the Neolithic person.\n3. Option A 'thank god' isn't exactly the solution to the issue of hunger. Option B 'hunt for food' is a possible strategy used to meet hunger needs.\n4. Option 'C find another place to live' is not plausible. The Neolthic people lived a nomadic lifestyle, which would have been challenging to change their environment.\n5. Option E'stay there' is also not plausible. Staying in one spot may lead to resource depletion and over-hunting.\n6. The most suitable strategy based on the context of the scenario would be Option D 'Hunting with spears', which would be an effective strategy and also align with the Neolithic dietary preferrance.\n7. So, the answer would be Option D 'hunt with spears'.\nSo the final answer  is D: hunt with  spears\n\nInput: She is in a good mood, so she's always smiling. Is that true?

It is evident from the wording of the question that the individual was in a situation of scarcity and need, suggesting a shortage of food.\n2.) Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the individual sought sustenance through the hunting of game or through foraging for wild edibles, as there are no other options presented that would allow the individual to sustain themselves.\n3.) Digging for food may have been an option, but it is unclear if the individual was able to locate, transport, or safely store the food.\n4.) It may be more likely that the individual relied on assistance from other members in the community to support them during their time of need, which would involve either forming new social ties or strengthening existing ones.\n5.) It should be noted that making friends was not presented as a viable solution and is instead replaced by finding shelter.\n6.) From this evidence, it seems that the more likely outcome was that the individual found shelter with another member of their community, which provided both protection and access to resources that could be shared.\n7.)

It is important to note that the question asks about a solution to a problem, rather than a specific problem.\n\nWith the given information, we can infer that the person was hungry, and hunt for food options would suggest a solution to that problem. \n\nWe can also see that option B mentions cook food, which may not be the same as the need for food and could be a solution to a different problem (such as a hunger/discomfort) from the given information.\n\nLooking at option C it is unclear why food would be hunted in abundance for berries. The question doesn't mention berries, so it's hard to assume that the neolithic person would hunt berries and a need for food would likely be a more urgent concern.\n\nWhile option E mentions inventing bread, the question doesn't mention inventing food, so it's unclear why bread would be the solution to the problem. \n\nThat's said, what's more probable is for us to see people inventing foods that can be saved for longer periods of time. Foods like bread or cereals, for example. Option D offers one of the possibilities, referring to cooking food as a solution.\n11.

This suggests that they made them to satisfy their hunger.\n3) The stone tools were the only choice they had in order to make fire, this means that the neolithic person solved their hunger problem by making the stone tools in order to get fire.\n4) The fire resulted in the killing animals and gathering food which solved their whole problem. To answer the question, the answer should be a choice that leads to the solution of the problem, since the neolithic people made stone tools, which solved their hunger problem, the correct answer should be made stone tools, which led to the solution of the hunger problem of neolithic people\n\nInput: Which of the following is the best way to ensure you are happy at work? Choices:  People:  A: Work on yourself B: Don't compare yourself C: Work hard D: Focus on others E: Do something that doesn't make you money  Hint: What is the most important for you?\n\nOutput: A.

This is because the speaker doesn\u2019t start the sentence by giving a clear definition of the term, \u201cquiet\u201d. We often take that word for granted, assuming that we know what it means. If you\u2019re an English speaker from the United States, the word \u2018quiet\u2019 would probably bring to mind a couple of different images:\n\n1. A quiet place (a quiet room, home or out in the country near a quiet lake side)\n\n2. Silence (which is when someone is literally being quiet, i.e. being silent or staying quiet)", "answer": " 12"}
{"text": ": grow crops D: discover fire E: kill a dinosaur\nOutput: 1) The neolithic man was hungry so he decided what action to take to satisfy his hunger.\n2) The options provided suggest that the neolithic man may have tried different methods to find food or address his hunger.\n3) The man may have prayed for food, but that doesn't necessarily mean he was able to find the solution he needed.\n4) Growing crops is only one possible solution, but it's not clear if the man has tried this strategy.\n5) Discovering fire may have helped in hunting for food, but it doesn'tknow whether the man has had the opportunity to do so.\n6) If the neolithic person were to kill a dinosaur to feed himself, it wouldn't necessarily be a solution to his problem, as it wouldn't be sustainable in the long run.\n7) So, the answer should be D: Grow crops.\nSo the final action has to be A) Grow Crop\n\nInput: The story was tragic, but he didn't lose hope and  what? Choices: A: gave up B: moved on C: felt sorry D: tried to change E: had faith in something\nOutput: 1: The question is asking for an action that the person did not take, even if the person was experiencing tragedy.\n\n2. The context suggests that the person is \"tragic\", which means the person is experiencing a situation that is upsetting or difficult to bear.\n3. The person is \"not losing hope\", meaning that despite the difficult circumstances, the person is not giving up or abandoning the situation.\n4. Based on the options given - B, C, and D - they seem to pertain more to specific emotional states rather than actions, whereas action is the keyword in the question.\n5. The word that best fits the situation is E) 'Had faith in something'. As the question is asking for the most suitable action in this context, the person is still seeking to find a way to improve the situation.\n6. Although there is no indication whether the person succeeded in their goal, it is clear that their actions include having faith in something, which does not fit the other options, which focus on emotions.", "answer": " 294"}
{"text": ": eat some nuts D: farm some wheat E: grow plants\nOutput: 1) Firstly, hungriness can be solved through the act of agriculture, due to what is being hunted or fed. It can be done on a large scale, with enough resources, and by managing enough workforce.\n2) But since the man in this problem is \"neolithic\" - this means he is from the ancient stone age, and can't easily carry that much weight. This brings us to options \"E: Grow plants\".\n3) However, the \"growing\" of these plants would be a solution to a later problem in this case.\n4) Which is why, in the end, the only answer which fits into the context that was given is \"D: Farm some wheat\".\nSo the final output is d.

The option(s) are given in the form of how the hungry Neolithic person resolved the question of hunger.\n3.) Options A and B are both options that the Neolithic person can use to satisfy their hunger.\n4.) The Neolithic person uses option A or B to satisfy their hunger when they have no other option.\n5.) Neolithic people cannot find any other way to satisfy their hunger except option A or B.\n6.) Option C is a process or activity that the Neolithics people engage in to satisfy their hunger, but it is not a solution to their hunger problem.\n7.) Option D is something that the Neolithicians can exchange for food when they are in need.\n8.) Option E is what Neolithic people did to satisfy their hunger after they got bored with the traditional activities of fishing and hunting.\n9.) The Neolithician is a person with a solution. The Neolithic people find satisfaction and enjoyment in new activities outside of the old hunting and fishing activities.\n10.) Therefore, the most suitable answers for this situation are options A and B.\nSo the final answers are A and B (anser 1 and ansr 2).\n\nInput: The word \"exquisite\" means \"so perfect as to give delight\".

Thus, it is obvious that an object of the context (word) must be used to describe it.\n4) Looking at the other answers that describe people, gifts, objects, and books, it is clear that the only answer that applies to a word is option E.\n5) Option D is not suitable as \"", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": ": plant food D: barter for it E: build more houses\nOutput: 1.\"Neolithic\" is a term that refers to the phase of human development in which people made the transition from hunting and gathering, to agriculture and settlement.\n2. People were hungry during the time when a lot of people shifted their focus to agriculture and it's what we were asked in the question.\n3. People were hunter gatherers until they figured out how to farm.\n4. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, D, and E which talk about things such as thanks, more houses and bartering.\n5. Choice B \"hunt for food\" would be applicable considering they were hunters and gatherers initially.\n6. But, that is not what caused food to be abundant, as the next option talks about.\n7. As a result, choice C \"plant food\" seems to be the best answer.\n8. So, the final answer is C : plant food.\nSo the final solution is C: plant food\n\nInput: The man with the black eye is very shy, he didn't enjoy being asked about the incident.  He was more worried about what? Choices: A: looking foolish B: looking pathethic C: looking funny D: looking like an idiot E: looking like he had to explain something\nOutput: 1: If someone with a black eye is asked about the incident that caused the black eye and is shy about it, how can he be asked about the incident with a black eye?\n2. We're given information about the man, how the man was, and how the man felt about what happened to cause his black eye.\n3. This information can be used to provide insight into the possible answers.\n4. We can eliminate choice A: looking foolish, as being asked about the incident would not make someone look foolish so it's not a possible reason for him being shy.\n5. Choices B, C, and E: would make the man look pathetic, funny, or look like he had to explain a stupid mistake that he made.\n6. Choice D: looking like an Idiot is the best fit to the information provided as it best represents the potential answer of how the man felt.\n7. So, the final solution is D: looking like an ass", "answer": " 760"}
{"text": ": pray to mother earth D: hunt for meat E: eat something fresh\nOutput: 1: First, we need to consider options and word usage.\n2. Option 'Thank god' has a religious or spiritual undertone, while Option 'Pray to Mother Earth' involves a similar type of plea to the environment.\n3. The options 'Hunt for food' and 'Hunt for meat' are not necessarily'solutions' that a person of the neolithic era would use to solve their problem.\n4. The option 'Eat something fresh' seems logical and straightforward and is also in line with the wording used in the question which refers to the individual 'being' hungry.\n5. Therefore the best solution is likely to be Option 'Eat something fresh'.\nSo the final answer will be E: eat something fresh.\n\nInput: At school, you need to get good marks to get a promotion.

However the test went poorly the person took and was not able to get the required level of marks. If he or she did not, they would not be promoted or given a good position at the school or workplace.\n3. Given the stakes and the person's status or role in the organization, their preferred response to not obtaining the necessary marks and not being appointed for a position at the workplace would most likely not be to say (A) (2.5) and (B) (2, 5, 3, 4, 5).\n4. Rather, their response would most likely be to (C) (3, 4,5, 5, 4, 6), as this response, while still not the best, would involve some level of success and may result in the person obtaining a high enough score or level to be given a rank or", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": make tools D: eat fish E: pray\nOutput: 1.) The first thing to understand is that \"neolithic person\" refers to people who lived during the Stone Age, or the Neolithic age.\n2.) The question implies that the neolithic person is hungry and is seeking a solution to the problem.\n3.) Looking at the choices, it is evident that the answer would likely be related to food or survival.\n4.) The choice \"Pray\" does not have a relation directly with food, however, \"pray\" may be part of finding solutions in the long run, like \"thank god\", but it doesn't involve food directly.\n5.) In contrast, \"make tools\" and \"hunt for food\" both involve actions involving food.\n6.) \"Make tools\" could mean building a shelter or constructing tools for survival, food storage, or hunting.\n7.) \"Hunt\" implies searching for prey, catching it, or preparing to eat it.\n8.) Therefore, based on the context and reasoning, the answer is more likely to be \"B: hunt for food\" or, at a stretch \"D: eat fish\".\n9.) Given that the person is said to be \"hungry\" we can assume that searching for prey would be more likely than praying, given that the person would most probably be eating the prey.\n10.) Therefore, we can also discard the choices \"A: thank god\" and \"E: pray\" as unlikely.\n11.) The remaining choices provide different degrees of relatedness.\n12.) \"Hunt for food\" shows greater relevance as food was part of the solution to the problem and as it has a direct relation to the Neolithic era, in which people used tools and hunted for food.\n13.) \"Make tools\" shows a slightly lower level of relevance as it does not directly solve the problem of hunger.\n14.) \"Eat fish\" shows a somewhat lesser relevance as fish were not necessarily a main part of the Neolithic diet.\n15.) Therefore, the best options are \"B: hunt\" and \"D: eat fish\", which would satisfy the context of the question best.\n16.) Given the two options, the answer is either \"B: hunt\", or \"D", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": ": create fire D: dig for food E: create tools\nOutput: 1)  We need to determine what \"neolithic\" means and the context in which it is mentioned. \n2) \"Hunt for food\" is an option that does not make sense in this context, as it does not mention any tools, fire, or digging that might be possible solutions to the problem.\n3) \"Create fire\" and \"dig for food\" do not necessarily require the knowledge of any specialized tools or fire creation abilities. \n4) \"Create tools\" is a solution that might have been more viable for these people.  However, it is not the only solution, and the question does not mention any specific skills or knowledge these people had that might lead to the use of these tools. \n5) Therefore, the most likely solution in this context is \"create tools.\" \n6) Based on the provided options, the correct answer would likely be \"C: create tools.\"\nSo the final answer would be C: create tools\n\nInput: If a person has a problem with the computer then, what could they do?

{"text": ": grow plants, raise sheep, grow wheat D: go deep into the cave E: cook the food\nOutput: 1) It is obvious that \u201cgo deep into the cave\u201d is the wrong choice because the Neolithic person does not have any intent or ability to return again to the surface of the earth after staying deep within the cave.\n2) The Neolithic period includes the transition from hunting to settlement living so people start using wheat around 10250 BC in the Near East and later on agriculture is spread out, and food is made in a bigger range. \n3) In the Neolithic period, people are still hunting and gathering.\n4) It is a long process of evolution that lasts a long time.\n5) The Neolithics only grow plants and raise sheep. They do not grow wheat because the Neolithics do not believe in planting. They don't plant anything and don\u2019t develop the way of growing wheat like farming.\n6) They used the wheel to transport food, but the Neolithics did not use cooking. They have not developed fireworks.\n7) \u201chunt for food\u201d is the option that people in the Neolithic can do.\n8) So the correct answer is: \u201chunt for food\u201d.\nSo the final answer in the Neolithics only hunt for food\n\nInput: Which of these describes something that is difficult to understand?

{"text": ": make a soup D: go to the farm E: go to a forest\nOutput: 1) The neolithic period - refers to a time when people began to live primarily by farming and other agricultural practices rather than hunting and gathering.\n2) People in the neolithic period often faced hunger and food shortages, so solutions included hunting for food, making soup, and looking for farms.\n3) Going to the farm alone wouldn't solve their problem, as they had to hunt or make soup.\n4) It's not known why exactly they went to the forest, but it was likely due to lack of food and not just for hunting.\n5) There is no evidence that the neolithic people thanked God for being provided food, thus this cannot be the correct option.\n6) Making soup is a solution to food shortages, but it's not clear if this is what they were thankful for. \n7) Going to the forest was likely for food, and not for hunting.\n8) Therefore, the answer is likely: B: Hunt for food\n9) The rest of the options do not make much sense from a time and context perspective since most of them lack the essential word 'for'.\n10) Thus, the answer is B: Hunt for Food.\nSo the final output is B: Hunt For Food\n\nInput: The 10 letter word was not a single English word, it was a what?

It is often used as a shorthand to express a particular meaning.\n5) Phrases in English can be in any form, such as a noun phrase, verb phrase, or adjective phrase.\n6) Therefore, the answer choice D: phrase, stands out and can be ruled out as an option", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": ": make a kill D: hunt wild animal E: make food\nOutput: 1.) The question gives a brief background on the Neolithic population and their way of life, specifically mentioning that they \"depended on hunting and fishing for their food\".\n2. Hunting is the main practice utilized to obtain food for the Neolithic person.\n3. Hunting could take the form of hunting wild animals or making a kill, though the wild animals part is implied.\n4. The given options are:\n  Making food, which could refer to the preparation of food\n  Hunt for food, but does not indicate whether it involves wild animals or not\n  Thank god, which seems unlikely as a viable option\n  Hunt for wild animal, which does not directly indicate how food is obtained\n  Make a kill, which seems like the most likely option when considering the context of hunting wild animals, which we can draw from the prior information provided.\n5. Now, we must analyze the other qualifiers we have, namely:\n  Making a kill is something that is often done during hunting, whereby killing a prey is an outcome and a kill refers to a dead animal.\n  This suggests that hunters kill wild animals and this action, specifically killing a wild animal, is the most likely next step of what will satisfy the Hungry Neolithic People.\n  From that reasoning, the answer would be D: Hunting wild animals.\nSo the final correct answer would be D: hunting wild animals\n\nInput: As far as I'm concerned, they're just another person looking to do their day-job, make a little money.

{"text": ": pray D: grow E: make clothing\nOutput: 1: The question is talking about neolithic people who had to find a solution to hunger.\n2. Looking at the options, we can infer that the people might have been thankful for the existence of the food that they were looking for and could also have prayed to their god for help.\n3. However, neither thanking their god or praying to it can be considered as a'solution' but more of an expression or acknowledgment of a situation.\n4. Option A, 'thanking god' refers to the gratitude for the existing or finding of food, which might be interpreted as an expression of their situation rather than as a solution.\n5. Option C, 'praying' to their god, isn't really a solution either. It's more a gesture to express their state of being, which could be interpreted that of gratitude towards the divine.\n6. Option D, 'grow food', could very well be a solution to their problem of finding food as they would not have to hunt for it anymore.\n7. Option D is more logical than options A and C, since they refer to the expression of their situation rather that any solution to the problem.\n8. Hence, the answer is D.\nSo, the final answer is D.\n\n### Note:\n* When it comes to questions of choosing an option between more than 2 options, choose the one which is more logical considering the context of the situation.", "answer": " 1000"}

{"text": ": farm D: find a tree E: grow their own food\nOutput: 1) One of the first forms of agriculture was domesticated animals.\n2) As a form of food, domesticating animals can be time-consuming requiring extra effort.\n3) Domesticated animals also require extra care which can be a cause of concern in certain situations.\n4) Given these points, there was a need for another solution.\n5) It's possible that people during this period used hunting to satisfy their need for food, but this would be less convenient compared to domesticating animals.\n6) An easier solution to meet food needs is to grow one's own food. It's possible that neolithic people cultivated trees or crops near their settlement for subsistence.\n7) However, this again requires extra care and effort.\n8) Fortunately, people can also eat food that is found naturally in its surroundings.\n9) The natural food that people can grow around them is wild animals.\n10) As a result, neolithic people could grow and eat food found naturally around them, such as wild animals.\n11) Therefore, the answer is most likely to be E: grow their own plants and eat the meat of wild animals.\nSo the final  answer is E: grow their own wild plants and eat the meat wild animals.\n\nInput: What is a thing that people don't have?

In the present scenario, the problem is food-related, and one can reasonably assume that the given options represent various approaches to the challenge of obtaining sufficient food for survival.\nBased on the context, we can rule out B and D which do not seem to be relevant.\nFrom the remaining four options, C \"find more plants\" is the most probable answer as it is the most specific and direct solution to the problem of food scarcity, followed by A \"thank god\" which is a general expression of gratitude that might be suitable in a variety of circumstances.\nE \"invent food\" and E \"invent eating\" are interesting options that may carry additional value or perspective beyond the immediate problem of lack of food, but they do not directly address food scarcity. This question is primarily about finding food to survive, so neither of these options makes sense as the best answer.\n\nInput: I was thinking of an idea for a cake to bake.  How I can  use this idea for a cake  is to mix 2 different flavours Choices:  A; Flavour 1 B; Flavour 2 C; Flavour 3  D; Flavour 4 E: Flavour 5\nOutput: First, we understand the context of the problem and the given options. It is clear that the question refers to a specific recipe or flavor combination for baking a cake.\nThe word \"to bake\" provides information about the end goal, which in this context is to create a desirable baked good.\nIt is important to note that there are 5 possible options in the question, but there are only 4 correct answers. The 5th option includes \"Flavour 5\" which does not fit the context of the other options and is not necessarily a viable solution to the problem.\n\nGoing through the other options, the word combinations 'Flavour 1 + Flavour 2' appears to be the most appropriate answer as it describes a possible variation of flavors that could be added together to create an effective baking or cake-making solution.\n'Flavour 3' can also be considered as a possible option, but", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": ": pray for food D: harvest food E: eat anything\nOutput: 1) The Neolithic people were people who lived during the Upper Palate Revolution, a time period after the Paleolithic era and before the Bronze Age.\n2) They had to rely on hunting and gathering rather than agriculture, because farming was not yet a developed technology at that time.\n3) This means that the Neolithic people had to rely on hunting to provide food for them.\n4) Looking at the choice answers, we can say that they prayed for food, but this is not a logical and practical solution since they didn't know how to farm yet.\n5) It is also likely that they would be thankful to the gods after finding food, but would not be able to survive without it.\n6) Thus, the most logical answer that suits the context perfectly is E: eat anything. \nSo the final answer was\nE: eat anything\n\nInput: The term microevolution refers to...

The options include 'thank god' and 'pray'. It's clear that these are not specific solutions to the given problem.\n3.) The choices 'plant seeds' and 'hunt for food' are both specific solutions.\n4.) The key difference between 'planting seeds' and 'finding food' is that the latter is a specific action, while the former is passive.\n5.) Therefore, the answer is not specific enough to be 'plant seeds'.\n6.) Given this, the most specific options remaining are choices D and E.\n7.) In this scenario, hunting for food would be a more appropriate solution to the given problem. \n8.) Therefore, the answer would be D: Hunt for food.\nSo the final answers is D: hunt for food\n\nInput: How do you like to be recognized? Choices:  My name, if I'm feeling generous.

{"text": ": hunt for food and use tools D: farm E: gather food\nOutput: 1) The context of the question is about Neolithic people and how they solved their problems.\n2) Hunting for food is commonly associated with the act of hunting rather than farming.\n3) Gathering food is generally associated with gathering produce from land such as fruits, herbs, and vegetables, and does not necessarily involve the use of tools.\n4) Using tools is likely to involve hunting for animal prey or gathering fruits and vegetables, making the options A and D more plausible.\n5) Farming is a more likely action that is likely to help solve the problem of hunger, especially for landless nomadic people like the Neolithic.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is B: hunt for the food\nSo the final answer would B: Farm\n\nInput: Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday are like which other day of week?

{"text": ": hunt the meat D: gather food E: stew the meat\nOutput: 1) The key words in the question are 'neolithic' and 'hunter'.  Neolithic is a term used to refer to a specific period in history, namely the period between 10,000 and 2,000 BC in Europe, Asia, and Africa.\n2) During this period, hunter-gatherers were the primary source of food for people.  They relied on their hunting skills to provide themselves with food.\n3) This indicates that option A is more likely to be the correct one.  \n4) Option B would not likely be the solution to a hungry person's problem since it refers to \"hunting for food\", which would mean that the person would have to find the food themselves rather than relying on the food being provided to them.\n5) Option C refers to hunting \"the meat\", which indicates that the focus is on hunting the animal rather than just \"hunting for\" or \"hunting\" food in general.\n6) Option D refers to \"gathering food\", which could be a partial solution, but it would be better to refer to hunting or gathering meat specifically.\n7) Finally, option E refers to \"stewing the meat\", which would be a natural outcome of gathering the meat and could potentially be an effective solution to a hungry individual's problem, although it is not the focus of the question, which is on \"hunting the meat\".\n8) In summary, based on the context, the correct answer is A: Thank God.\nSo the final answers are A: thank god\n\nInput: After they were told to stop, he said thank you for what?

However, there is no mention of a person teaching someone else, so that can't be the right answer. \n4, Option B says giving. However, there is nothing in the question about giving anything. \n5, Option C says paying. This", "answer": " 264"}
{"text": ": pray to god D: plant some food E: invent fire\nOutput: 1- Since they are hungry, we can assume that they did not have sufficient food to eat.\n2. In the given options, we can understand that A \"thanking god\" is a religious belief and may not necessarily solve the hunger problem.\n3. Similarly, option B \"hunt for food\" relies on the person being able to hunt effectively, which may vary depending on the person's skill level.\n4. Option D is not clear, but if it means \"planting food for later use\", they cannot depend on it when they are hungry.\n5. Option E is a logical way to solve the hunger problem by using fire to cook the food or produce more food through roasting etc.\n6. Therefore, they could have made fire from their tools and used it to cook the food.\n7. Since they were neolithic, they probably did not know how to make fire from tools, so option E is not likely.\n8. The most likely answer is Option C: Praying to God.\nSo the final solution is C: Praying To God\n\nInput: Some say that the more educated you are, the less likely you'll experience racism, but what do we think of that?

{"text": ": ask the gods for help D: pray for help E: starve\nOutput: 1 As we can infer from the question, one of the first humans - or neolithic people - was hungry and starved.\n2. Due to limited access to food, they had to hunt for food to survive.\n3. There were likely beliefs that the gods controlled the food supply, so praying to the gods would help fulfil the hunger.\n4. However, we don't know if there were other options available to satisfy one's hunger.\n5. Given what we know, the answer most likely involves: praying for help or asking the gods for help, which are both likely options the neolithic person could have taken to satisfy their hunger.\n6. Therefore, the most likely answer is either D: pray for help or E: ask the gods for \n7. So the final answer is either D: Pray for help or E: Ask the gods for help\n\nInput: A man who can only communicate with animals, including birds, can't get a job as a what? Choices: zookeeper B: vet C: trainer D: hunter E: gamekeeper\nOutput: 1: The first paragraph talks about a man who can only communicate, including birds, and so a 'zookeeper' doesn't seem to be an option, as they don't communicate with animals.\n2. 'Vet' is a doctor who treats animals (pets), though not necessarily birds.\n3. 'Trainer' is a person who trains animals (mostly dogs) for performing tricks or shows.\n4. 'Hunter' is a 'gamekeeper' is someone who manages a game reserve or farm.\n5. The 'gamekeeper' manages the game and is skilled in hunting.\n6. This fits the context better than the other options, and so the answer would be 'gamekeeper'.\nSo the final answer would be D: Gamekeeper\n\nInput:  There are a number of famous rock bands.

{"text": ": pray and fast D: bake sour dough E: find some plants to eat\nOutput: 1) Neolithic people were hunter-gatherers who would hunt for food sources or cultivate crops like sorghum, wheat, and millet.\n2) Among their food sources was wild game and grass-fed animals. \n3) The Neolithic age began approximately 10,000 years BC in parts of the Fertile Crescent where the first agricultural crops grew.\n4) The Neolithc era had its own challenges, and one of those was how to keep food from spoiling.\n5) For this reason, baking sour dough bread was a popular food preservation method in the Neolithic era.\n6) A simple dough made up of flour, water and salt was left to ferment for 8-24 hours before it was shaped into loafs and baked in an oven or over hot stones.\n7) The bread was kept in clay jars or vessels with lids.\n8) When the loaf was baked, the gases produced during fermentation caused the dough to rise and harden on the sides of the container.\n9) The resulting loaf could be kept for up to a month if kept in a cool, dry place.\n10) The ability to preserve food was critical for the Neolithic people, as they had to rely heavily on the fruits and vegetables of the season.\n11) As a result, they had to find ways to make the most of their food sources and preserving it was one of the ways to do that.\n12) Baking sour dough helped them achieve this, as it extended the shelf life of their food and allowed them to store more of it.\n13) Therefore, the answer is B: hunt for the food.\nSo the final answers is B: hunt the food\n\nInput: What's the best way for a pimp to control his crew?

{"text": ": eat a plant D: cook the meat E: eat the bird\nOutput: 1) Hunting for food and eating meat were activities performed by neolithic people. \n2) The fact that the neolithic person is referred to as \"were\" implies that this process was done on a regular basis.\n3) The activity of hunting could be performed through hunting tools, which would require an effort and skill.\n4) Eating a plant or cooking the meat involved minimal work. \n5) There are options that include the use of tools, like A & B, but these require more effort than eating a plant or cooked meat, which are simpler and more immediate activities.\n6) Therefore, the correct answer is E: eat a bird\nSo the final answer will be E: eat a bird.\n\nInput: What is the best advice for choosing your seat in an airplane? Choices: 1.  Stick to the outside 2.  Stick to one side\nOutput1: 1. The airplane seat is described as \"best\" so the advice must be good.\n2. The seat does not necessarily need to be one side, just generally speaking.\n3. The choice of seat on an airplane is a personal preference for how comfortable or safe the person feels.\n4. The choices given reflect the options of the seat but cannot apply to all people equally.\n5. Choices 1 and 2 are specific types of seats and do not apply to all types of aircrafts or different seat plans available.\n6.

{"text": ": buy food E: pick berries D: make a cake\nOutput: 1) The context of the question indicates that the Neolithic people were hunter-gatherers, and their main source of food was hunting for animals and gathering plants and fruits.\n2) The question itself is a hypothetical one, asking what the Neolithic person would do if they were hungry.\n3) The options provided include buying food, making a cake, and picking berries.  C) make a cake\" option was not what the Neoliths would have done.  Neolithic people did not have access to the technology and infrastructure needed to make cakes.  The Neolithic people lacked the tools and technology to make cakes, but they had the skills and knowledge needed to prepare meals by hunting animals and gathering plants.\n4) C) make a cakes was an incorrect answer.\n5) The correct answer is D: \"pick berries\". This is because the Neolithic period was characterized by the adoption of agricultural and animal husbandry practices.  It is possible that some Neolithic people would have gathered wild berries for their diet or used them as a means to prepare their food.  Picking berries was a common food harvesting technique during that period.\nSo the final Answer is D: Picking berries\n\nInput: The man had been dead for many years, why would a woman weep over him? Choices:  E: He\u2019s a loved one. A: She loves him. B: He has just died. C: He is in her class.

The options A and B can be eliminated, as they are only meant to convey appreciation for food without any action taken to address the hunger.\n3. Option C can be eliminated as praying alone would not result in obtaining food.\n4. Option E can also be eliminated as building a cave does not directly address the problem of hunger, but rather solves the problem of food storage.\n5. Option C can be disqualified because it doesn't address hunger.\n6. Option D is unlikely because it does not refer to the problem at hand.\n7. The most likely answer would be D: pray for food since it is a solution.\nSo the final answers are D: pray for food\n\nInput: Where did the man put his money that he thought was stolen? Choices: 1. A: Bank 2. B: Cave 3. C: Backyard 4. D: Bedroom 5. E: Safety box\nOutput: 1) The question is asking where the man put his money after he thought it was stolen.\n2) The options A (Bank), B (Cave), C(Backyard) and D (Bedroom) are all logical places to store money, but the most reasonable one would be D (Bedroom).\n3) Option A (Bank) would only make sense if he put it in a secured bank safe deposit box.\n4) Option B (Cave) may not make sense as it assumes he would take his money to a cave to store it.\n5) Option C (Backyard) may not be a reasonable option for storing money because it is not secure enough for the fear of stolen and it is exposed to risks such as fire.\n6) Option E (Safety box) may not be a reliable option as it requires him to have a safety box key and the risk of its theft is still existent.\n7) The most likely answer is D (Bedroom), which is both a safe and comfortable place to store money.\nSo the final choices are 1: B, 2: D", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": ": get some D: pray E: go to the supermarket\nOutput: 1024. First, we should understand the context of the question.\n2. The question is about Neolithic people and their way of facing problems.\n3. The term \"hunt for food\" implies a problem faced by the people at that time.\n4. The word \"pray\" also indicates a problem or hunger but it does not necessarily imply a situation faced by the people at the time.\n5. The phrase \"go to the supermarket\" is a modern-day solution, which was not available to the people of that time.\n6. We can thus infer that option A is incorrect.\n7. Options B and C seem to be describing a possible solution.\n8. Options D and E do not make sense for the people at that time since they did not have access to the modern-day amenities offered by the supermarket.\n9. Therefore we can conclude that the people at that time would have used the hunt method or other forms of survival to face their problems.\n10. Option C - HUNT FOR FOOD would be the plausible response as it is the most appropriate way of facing hunger at that time.\n11. So, the correct option is C: HUNT FOR FOOD.\nSo the final correct answer is the same as the provided answer.\n\nInput: My friend told me, \"Those people are bad\".

The question is about what can be said about a friend who called someone bad.\n2. The options listed are possible reactions given by the person who heard the insult from the friend.\n3. The first two options - \"He is wrong\" and \"I agree\" imply that the person agrees with the claim made by the friend (that the other people are bad) and hence seems to contradict them.\n4. The third option - \"He is right\" implies that the person agrees wholeheartedly with the friend and will join him in calling the other people bad.\n5. The final option - \"I don't know\" indicates that the person does not agree with the friend's statement and neither", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": ": search for mammoths D: gather berries E: discover a new cooking method\nOutput: 1). This question is asking about how the Neolithic person solved their hunger problem. \n2). We can infer from the options that the Neolithic people were either hunter-gatherers or foragers, depending on the time they were living in. \n3). Based on the time these people lived, it can be assumed that they were likely hunter-gatherer or foraging for food instead of hunting for food.\n4). This means that the most likely choice is D: gather berries, as the other options are not realistic options for the Neolithic period.\n5). Therefore, the answer is likely D: gather berries.\nSo the final choice is D: gathering berries\n[source](https://gmatclub.com/forum/if-nj-has-418-24-of-its-housing-units-in-newark-and-vp-has-112-of-its-313-retail-units-in)", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": go grocery shopping D: learn agriculture E: cook\nOutput: 1) Based on the provided context and information, we can infer that the neolithic person faced a problem of being hungry.\n2) The solution to the problem of being hungry would typically be finding food to eat, which is the option C: 'go to the grocery store'.\n3) However, it is unlikely that the neolithi would have grocery stores or know how to shop for food, so the most appropriate answer would be the option D: 'learn agriculture'.\n 4) The only other option that could be considered as a possible solution is option A: Thank God.  However, this is simply not sufficient for a hungry neolithic person as it does not directly provide them with food.\n5) Therefore, the best option is D: learn agriculture.\nSo the final solution is D: learn agricultures\n\nInput: How much does she want for a car? $160,000.00, I have how much left?

This option is correct.\nSo the final answered the question is C: pray for god to feed them.\n\nInput: Which are the types of a trolley in public transport? Choices: 1. A: tramway 2. B: bus 3. C: monokable 4. D: subway 5. E: railcars\nOutput: 1). If we look into the option, then there is no any option is described as 'tram' so we can rule out option A.\n2). Next, we review the option B, there is not any option described as 'bus' and because B has only a single item, we rule out option B.\n3). Finally, there is no any description for the'monokable' which is used in the option C. As such, we can rule out option C.\n4). Next we consider option D,'subway' is described as the type of public transport.\n5). Finally, option E is 'railcars', and the description matches the concept in option C. The concept has also two items, thus we must rule out all the options except options E.\nSo the final final answer is C: railcars.\n\n##### Example 1\n\nInput: Which of the following words does not have a 'k' in it?

Options A and D are unlikely solutions to the Neolithic person's hunger problem, as there doesn't seem to be any indication of a religious belief or a sense of community like that of a church or village. \n3. Option B is also unlikely, as there is no evidence of humans being able to successfully hunt for wild animals on their own. This required knowledge of land territory and specialized tools, which did not exist during this time period.\n4.

{"text": ": leave D: kill E: pray\nOutput: 1) This question is asking about the solution used by the Neolithic people to address their hunger issue. \n2) As per the given choices, each letter represents a different solution that could be used to address hunger issues. Let's now try to match each answer choice to the given choices.\n3) Option A) \"Thank God\" appears to be an expression of gratitude, but it does not seem to refer to a specific solution for hunger. \n4) Option B) \"Hunt for Food\" implies that the Neolithic person may have searched for food in order to find a solution to their hunger issue.\n5) Option C) \"Leave\" could potentially be an option for addressing hunger, as the person may have left their original location to find food elsewhere. \n6) Option D) \"Kill\" appears to be an extreme solution to hunger, as it involves violence against another person or animal to obtain food. This would likely not be a solution that was used by the Neolothic people.\n7) Option E) \"Pray\" could potentially be a solution used by the Neolitic people to address their issue of hunger. This is supported by the fact that prayer is often associated with a desire for answers or solutions to problems. \n8) However, there is insufficient information given in the question to determine whether the Neolithic persons would actually engage in prayer in order to address their hunger issues. \n9) Overall, the best answer choice could be 'D: Kill' because it fits the description.\nSo the final conclusion is D: Kill\n\nInput: What is a word to describe when the sun goes away far from the earth and turns red over the horizon?

Based on this assumption, we have to understand the options thoroughly to choose the most suitable option.\n3. Option A - thank god - is unlikely to provide a solution to a problem. It may or may not be relevant, but it's not what the neolithic was looking for.\n4. Options B and C are very similar - one is hunt for food the other is invent fire - and both may be used as a solution to a problem of being hungry.\n4. Option D is a possible solution as going to church might provide sustenance or relief from hunger (through charity for example). \n5. Option E is not a solution as going to the grocery store doesn't address the issue of being hungry or solve the problem.\n6. Based on the above reasoning, we can conclude that the answer is D: go to church.\nSo the final is D: go to Church\n\nInput: What does the phrase 'taking one for the team\u2019 refer to in sports?

It is the term for the later part of the Stone Age, when tools were made from stone rather than wood or bone.\n2. This shift in behavior is associated with the development of farming and herding, which led to the introduction of settled communities and permanent dwellings.\n3. Based upon the provided information, it can be inferred that the neolithic person is in a situation of want or need, which is depicted through the use of the word \"hungry\".\n4. The person is faced with the problem of finding food and seeks a solution to this issue.\n5. The options provided each describe a solution to the problem of finding food, however only option D 'build a trap' would be a valid solution.\n6. Option A 'thank god' refers to a prayer or religious practice, and may not be applicable as a solution to the problem.\n7.

Choices: 1. A: quarrel B: dispute C: argument D: rumble E: battle\nOutput: 1: The term most often used in day-to-day language, both in formal and informal situations, is 'argument.'\n2: In this context, 'quarrel' does not make sense since the term refers to a personal fight or battle between family members or relatives.\n3: 'Disturbance' can be used to refer to a minor fight or disagreement, but it does not necessarily connote a disagreement or argument over a minor fact.\n4: 'Rumble' has nothing to do with a \"minor fact\" since it usually refers to a physical fight or \"scrap.\"\n5: 'Battle' or 'fight' can be used in different contexts to refer to a physical dispute, but in the context of minor details such as in business situations, it is usually not used.\n6: Therefore, the correct answer would be A: Argument.\nSo the final ansnwer is A: Argument. \n\n\nInput: How many minutes to the hour are fifteen?

E: hunt for more.\nOutput: 1..The answer choices seem to be a bit outdated and the context is not specific enough to narrow down the choices.\n2..However, if we look at what the word \"hunt\" means, we can deduce the correct answer from the context.\n3..Hunting was the main source of food for ancient civilizations, and it was a common practice in many cultures.\n4..Based on the context, the solution to the question should be related to hunting or hunting for food.\n5..Hunting for food can be classified as a hobby or a way of life, and it can also be a necessary occupation in many parts of the world.\n6..Based on this definition, the answer to the problem could be anything from \"make bread\" to \"hunt for more\", depending on the specific context of the situation.\n7..For example, if the Neolithic person was starving and had no other options, they could try to \"hunt for food.\" However, if they had enough resources and the situation was not so dire, they might opt for \"make bread\" or \"hunt for more.\"\n8..Overall, the answer to this question relies on the specific context or situation, and the person's motive and the availability of resources.\n9..So, we can conclude that the answer may be something like \"make bread\" or if the situation is dire - \"hunt for food\", depending on the details.\n10..\"Pray\" does not seem relevant to the question because prayer does not solve any of the person's problems.\n11..\"Thank god\" is irrelevant to the question because it is not possible to tell from the context if the person believed in god or if that was also an option for them.\n12..Based on the above considerations, the answer is more likely to be \"hunt for more\" or \"make bread\" than any of the other choices.\n\nSo the final answer in Option A is B: Hunt for food.", "answer": " 255"}

The problem seems clear, as a neolithic man is hungry.\n2) Now, we need to match the wording of the question with the answer provided. \n3) The answer is \"Pray\". \n4) Praying seems like the most sensible solution to the problem. \n5) However, if it was a \"Neolithic man\" solving the issue, praying is unlikely to be the best option.\n6) Additionally, we need to determine if \"neolithic man\" actually practiced praying as a means of solving problems. \n7) Based on the information, praying is the correct answer.\nSo the final solution is E: pray\n\nInput: When doing this work, what do you need to do first? Choices:  Ask  for permission to use what on the property  Ask  for permission from the owner to enter and walk through what property  Ask  for forgiveness from everyone on the property that you will be entering for the duration of working  Ask  for forgiven for being in what property without permission\nOutput: 1.) First of all, let's take a look at the question to understand the context. For example, what is \"this work\", or \"using whatever property?\" \n2.) Ask for forgivness is the best option because asking for forgivness is necessary.\n3.) Asking to use the property is necessary too.\n4.)  What's clear is that there are many possible answers to the question, so the key is to find the correct answer that fits the best with the context. \n5.) Since the context of the question is \"work\" on someone's property, it suggests that forgivness is necessary because it means respecting another person's wishes. \n6.) Using a property without permission is not respectful, and can be interpreted as unauthorized entry or theft. \n7.)  Hence, the answer would be best \"Ask for forgiveness.\"", "answer": " 121"}
{"text": ": grow food D: invent E: pray\nOutput: 1.The question asks about the Neolithic person. Neolithic people were hunter-gatherers meaning they depended on natural food sources to survive, so their \"solution to the problem\" of food insecurity is going to be related to growing or hunting food.\n2. Looking for \"Pray\" is a logical step but it's outside the scope of the question.\n3. Thanking god is an action that can't be done by humans or animals.\n4. Inventing something is an abstract thing and not necessarily relevant here.\n5. The options left are grow food and hunt for food, both of which are suitable answers.\n6. Though grow food as an answer is also plausible, because the neolithic people were hunters, that is a bit farfetched here. \n7. Therefore, \"hunt for food\" is a more logical response to the question.\n8. So, the answer is D.' Invent' here is used to convey innovation that enabled the neolithic hunter-gatherer to adapt.\n9. The solution to the problem of food insecurity is the \"hunt for food\", and therefore, the answer is D.\nSo the final answers is D: Invent.\n\nInput: Your friend always asks which kind of book should she read in the library.

{"text": ": leave D: stay put E: pray\nOutput: 1: The question asks about a neolithic person's solution to the hunger problem.\n2. The term \"neolithic\" refers to a period of prehistoric human development characterized by the use of stone tools and the domestication of crops and animals.\n3. As such, the question is likely to be referencing a scenario wherein a neolithic individual is faced with the problem of hunger and is in need of a solution.\n4. The options provided are as follows: A) \"Thank God\" is not a realistic option for a neolithic huntsman, who is accustomed to living off the land via hunting and gathering. B) \"Hunt for food\" would be the most likely solution to the hunger of a neolithic man.\n5. \"Leave\" and \"Stay put\" are both unlikely options for the huntsman, who has likely traversed far from his home in search of food. \"Pray\" is not a solution to hunger, as it only implies that the person is making a request for help rather than proactively trying to find an answer to the problem.\n6. \"Eat food nearby\" is a realistic option but one that could potentially indicate a lack of adequate resources to sustain long-term survival.\n7.

From the choices we get to know that there neolithics were always hungry and for that they did not have many options.\n3. Option A: thank god is out of the question because they cannot rely on God to feed them in times of scarcity.\n4. Option B: hunt for meat refers to killing a wild animal for food which is not that easy for neolithic people because they could not carry firearms or weapons.\n5. Option C: go foraging and looking for plants and berries as food is applicable as they were hunters and gatherers by profession but it doesn't explain why they were always hungry.\n6. Option D: take a nap refers to sleeping which is not viable in times of scarcities as their energy would be lost if they take enough time to sleep.\n7. Option D: look for plants in the forest which will surely benefit them as vegetables will provide them with nutrition. That's why option D should be the final answer.\nSo the final option is D: look for plants, berries and vegetables.\n\nInput: A good leader is likely to be a what?

Therefore, we are left with choice E: \"Eat the bones.\" This could be a solution since it ensures survival, but it might not be seen as a complete/ideal solution.\n9.. The answer would therefore be Option E: Eat the bones.\nSo the final answered is E: Eat the Bones\n\nInput: I thought that if you take aspirin, it will stop you getting headaches, but why didn't it work this time?

{"text": ": pray for blessing D: find a farmer E: pray for food\nOutput: 1.\"The Neolithic person was\" - This phrase indicates that the context relates to the Neolithic period, a period that spanned approximately from the 11th to the 9th millennium BCE and had distinctive cultural features that set it apart from other periods. Additionally, \"was\" implies that the person referred to has already experienced or undergone this action.\n2..Looking at the options, we can see that choices B,C,D and E all describe forms of seeking help in finding food.\n3.However, choice B \"hunt\" speaks to an activity done by hunters, which is a specific occupation that requires a certain level of skill, unlike the other options that are more general forms of seeking help.\n4. Additionally, the phrase \"was hungry\" indicates that the person did not have any skills related to hunting and that finding food was a significant problem or challenge for them.\n5.Taking all of this into consideration, it seems that the most likely action or behavior of the Neolithic person would be to find a farmer, given that farming is a widely practiced activity in human history, with evidence dating back to Neolithic times.\n6. Therefore, the most likely form of seeking help in finding a food source would be to find a nearby farmer, which is what option A \"Thank god\" implies.\nSo the final score is 30/30", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": ": go home D: cook food E: go to a kitchen\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the neolithic person's solution to the problem they faced, which was hunger.\n2) The key insight to note about the answer is that it would not be a single action, but a series of actions that would be undertaken. This would most likely involve multiple people working together.\n3) From the options given, it's clear \"D: Cook food\" is the most specific answer and fits the key insight. \n4) The Neolithic person' would not have had the ability to cook food on their own, due to limited resources and technologies available to them. \n5) The Neolith people likely ate together, based on their living arrangements and the evidence of stone tools and pots found with them. \n6) The solution to the hunger problem would involve multiple people working together to cook the food and distribute it to everyone. The choice \"E: Go to the kitchen\" is broad, as it's not specifically related to solving hunger, but could be applicable to other problems. A more specific answer would be \"go to the fire\".\n7) The Neolith Age is considered the first time humans made the move from hunter-gatherer societies to settling down, and cooking food can symbolize the movement to a more settled way of life.\n8) In conclusion, based on the key insight and the clues provided, the most likely answer is D: Cook food.\nSo the final answers is D: Cook food\n\nInput: The word \"spoof\" is a what?

{"text": ": make tools D: gathering food E: nothing\nOutput: 10. The question asks about the neolithic person's solution to hunger.\n2. The question provides information that the neolithic period was characterized by a shift from a hunting and gathering lifestyle to an agricultural lifestyle.\n3. This indicates that the neoliths must have come up with a way to produce food for themselves to survive.\n4. Given the context of the question, the answer to the choice between making tools or gathering food seems to indicate that the hunter-gatherer lifestyle is seen as a simpler one to be followed by modern society.\n5. Looking at the choices, the answer appears to be E: Nothing because hunter-gathering is seen as a form of food production which is not needed by modern society.\n6. However, it is important to further consider the choice between gathering food & hunting, as there is a suggestion that gathering food may be simpler and therefore would be considered a good solution.\n7. In some cases, hunting can be more intensive than gathering food as it requires more effort and can pose a higher risk for injury.\n8. Given this information, the answer cannot be E: Nothing because hunting is more work and riskier than gathering food.\n9.

{"text": ": kill animals D: grow food E: find and eat vegetation\nOutput: 1. First, it is important to have a general understanding of the neolithic period and its characteristic food sources. The neolithic period is known for its reliance on hunting and gathering as a way of acquiring food.\n2. This period saw an increase in the domestication of plants and animals, which further highlights this focus on food sources.\n3. These sources typically included meat from hunted animals, fruits, nuts, and vegetables gathered from foraging. This type of food consisted mainly of animal proteins and carbohydrates, which were more energy-dense and less filling compared to the starches and fibers in plants.\n4. To this end, the best answer would be E : Find and eat vegetation because it is the only option that mentions food sources in the neolithic age and is supported by the facts provided.\n5. However, the answer choices need to be further refined to make it an accurate conclusion.\n6. The option A \"thank god\" does not fit the logic of the question and is removed.\n7. The option B \"hunting for food\" does not involve gathering methods and the question is related to gathering. Hence option B is removed. \n8. The option C \"kill animals\" can be removed as this is also a hunting option.\n9. Finally the option D \"grow food\" does not mention plant-based sources and is not suitable as it is an overarching term.\nSo the final accurate answer is E: Find and eat vegetation\n\nInput: Which method involves two steps?

{"text": ": ask mother D: buy from supermarket E: buy the cheapest\nOutput: 1:  The question is asking about the solution that the Neolithic person took to solve their hunger problem.\n2. Considering the history of the Neolithic period and the context of the question, we can infer that the context is about the Neolithic people's way of life and survival during this period.\n3. The Neolithic period refers to the earliest period of human civilization and its advancement. It is known for its agricultural developments and the use of tools and technology.\n4. Considering the context, the answer to the question could be one of the following:\nThanks God: This would express an attitude of gratitude by the Neolithic individual, but it does not directly address their hunger problem. The Neolithics were likely to engage in hunting and gathering to secure their food supply and to preserve the environment.\nHunt for Food: This would refer to the act of hunting to procure food. In the context of the Neolithics, this may have been a common practice since they were nomadic hunter-gatherers who relied on hunting and gathering animals to survive. Ask Mother: This answer is ambiguous. The context states that the individual is \"hungry\", but it does not specify who the mother referred to is. Buy From Supermarket: This answer does not consider the context of the Neolitcs period that the question is referring to. This answer would be more suitable in a modern context. Buy The Cheapest: This answer would also not match the context described. This answer would be suitable in a modern context but not a context specific to the Neolithics.\n5.

The question describes how the Neolithic person was faced with the problem of being hungry and describes the possible solutions that they could have put in place.\n2. Based on this, we can understand that one of the solutions mentioned was to hunt for food.\n3. This option of hunting for food makes logical sense, as it was a way to provide food for the Neolithic people.\n4. Choices A, B and C appear illogical and are unlikely to be valid options.\n5. Choice D is not mentioned in the question and does not address the problem or provide a solution to it.\n6. Choice E is also not mentioned in the question.\n7. Therefore the possible option is D: hunt for food. \nSo the final answer set is D: hunt food.\n\nInput: A good chef makes what?

The answer choices have been provided in the form of a word and a phrase, which gives an indication that a good chef is able to prepare breakfast food items like a sandwich, an omelet and a breakfast. \n3. One could argue that any experienced chef can make a sandwich or omelet and therefore these options should not be included in the answer choices. \nHowever, the question is asking about a good chef, which suggests that they should be able to do so more effectively than average. \nMoreover, the phrase 'a good chef makes a breakfast' supports this by indicating that a good chef can create a nutritious and delicious breakfast. \n4. Based on this analysis, the answer choices should ideally be sandwich, omelet and breakfast. \n5. The phrase 'A (good chef) makes a breakfast' has a particular structure, and the correct phrasing should adhere to this: A good chef makes a (good or nutritious) breakfast. \n6. Based on this, the correct answer choice would be 'E: a breakfast'.\nSo the final answer", "answer": " 1050"}
{"text": ": pray for rain D: grow crops E: make fire & cook\nOutput: 1 The question begins with the statement that the \"Neolithic person was Hungry\".\n2. This indicates that the Neolithic person faced a problem of hunger and sought a solution to it.\n3. The choices proposed are: Thank God, Hunt For Food, Pray For Rain, Grow Crops, Make Fire And Cook.\n4. We can deduce the correct option based on the context of the problem statement.\n5. While thanking God for the solution is possible, it is not related to the problem statement, which speaks of a hungry Neolithic person. Therefore, option A \"thank god\" is eliminated.\n6. Option B, \"Hunt For Food\", implies hunting for food to solve the problem but there is a mention of a hungry Neoithic person, which does not necessarily require hunting for food, and could indicate a solution that is not necessarily related to hunting. Therefore, option B is also eliminated\n7. Option C \"Pray For Rain\" focuses on praying for rain to solve the problem of hunger but there is no mention of Neolithic person, so that option is also eliminated.\n8. Option C \"Grow Crops\" appears to be the most suitable option for the problem as a solution.\n9. Option D \"Make Fire And Cook\" also appears to be applicable to the problem.\n10. However, option D is too lengthy and specific, which makes it more cumbersome and less likely to be the correct answer. Further, there is no indication that the Neolithis person didn't solve the problem even though they didn't mention the exact solution. This suggests that cooking may not have been the only or preferred solution to solve the hunger problem.\n11. Based on the reasoning above, the most suitable answer is option C: Grow Crops.\nSo the final Answer:  C: Grow Croc\n\nInput: At the end of WWII the US wanted a nuclear arsenal to what?

{"text": ": go on a food run D: eat the food off the ground E: eat berries\nOutput: 1) The question asks about the solution that neolithic people used to solve the problem of being hungry and food being scarce. It's important to note it was a situation of not having enough food or the right type of food when they would eat the food off the grounds or eats berries.\n2) The solution that is considered to be a more permanent and well-accepted solution is B: hunt for the food.\n3) This solution is preferred over A: thank god, which is seen as a temporary solution, not one that provides long-term satisfaction or alleviates the problem.\n4) Additionally, the option C: go on a foor run implies that they could hunt for food, thus, it would seem to be redundant choice as it is simply the case of food being scarce rather than a choice on a solution.\n5) Option D: eat the food on the ground does seem like a potential solution, but it is not necessarily a more permanent or well-accepted solution.\n6) The choice E: eat berries also seems like a potential solution, however, it is not necessarily a choice that would provide long-term relief or alleviate the problem.\n7) Therefore, based on the context and the options provided, the answer that makes the most sense is B: hunt foor.\nSo the final answear I'll pick is B: hunt the food\n\nInput: If a cow says moo it's from what language? Choices:  English A: Spanish B: French C: Japanese D: Hawaiian E: German\nOutput: 1.) The question is asking about which language a cow would be speaking if it said \"moo.\"  it's important to note that the cow is not speaking any language as it simply makes the noise, so therefore it will never be able to speak anything, hence moo is not from any language.\n2.) Therefore, we can infer that C: Japanese is not the correct choice as \"moo\" is not a Japanese word.\n3.) B: French is ruled out as moo is not a French expression, even though it sounds like one.\n4.) D: Hawaiian is also eliminated for the same reason.\n5.) E: German is not applicable as \"moo\"", "answer": " 304"}
{"text": ": find animals and eat them D: look for rocks to smash over others heads E: pick fruit or leaves from a tree\nOutput: 1.'The Neolithic period was preceded by the Pleistocene and Paleolithic periods - it's a period of prehistory and is not an era. 2. We can understand the term 'Neolithic Person' to mean someone who lived during the Neolithic period.\n3. The term 'Neoliths' refers to tools made out of stone while 'Neolithic humans' means the people who lived during this period.\n4. This means that \"The Neolithic person\" in the question refers to someone who lived during the Stone Age or the Neolithic Era, and not a specific individual.\n5. It's not clear what the 'h/s' at the end of the question stands for which can be a challenge in interpreting it. Looking at other options, however, we can determine that they all have something to do with eating or a supply issue with food and this was a common method for ensuring survival during the Neolithics.\n6. First of all, we can rule out option 'A: thank god', which is not a logical response to hunger.\n7. Option B: \"to hunt for food\" refers to the ways in which people could acquire food, in particular hunting.\n1. We know that option B relates to acquiring food by hunting, and given the context of the question, 'The Neolithic Person' refers to someone who lived in this time period.\n2. Therefore, we can infer that option D: \"to find animals and eat them\" would be the best option.\n3. It's also worth noting that Neolithic humans were hunter-gatherers, so picking fruit or leaves from a plant would be unlikely.\n4. Therefore, the correct option is D: finding animals and eating them.\nSo the final answers is D: finding animals an eating them\n\nInput: How often do doctors use a tongue depressor?

{"text": ": create a shelter D: find a new home E: plant crops\nOutput: 1.) The context of the question suggests that the Neolithic person was facing a crisis of some sort, hungry and looking for a solution to their problem.\n2.) The solution being sought must be consistent with the options given since three of them \u2013 thanking God, hunting for food and planting crops \u2013 address hunger as the main issue.\n3.) Creating a shelter does not necessarily address hunger. The term \u2018shelter\u2019 can mean housing or shelter from the elements but in this context does not seem to pertain to the immediate need of addressing hunger.\n4.) Similarly, finding a new home does not necessarily addressing hunger either.\n5.) Based on this reasoning the only reasonable solution left to choose from is 'C: Create a shelter'. \n6.) Therefore, the answer is C.\nSo the final nswer is C: create a shelter\n\nInput: What is a pragmatic response when someone is banging on your door to ask for help? Choices: 1. I am not able to help\nChoices: 2. I am not around\nChoices: 3. I will help\nChoices:4 I will be right back\nChoices:5 I can't help\nOutput:\n\n1. \"I am not able to help\" is a polite way to turn down a request for help, saying that the person cannot provide assistance.  It conveys a sense of regret or regret and respect to the person who is banging on the door.\n\n2. \"I am not around\" is a polite reply to a request for help, allowing the inquirer to know that the person cannot help without interfering with their activities. It might not be feasible to respond because the person might already be occupied with other obligations or commitments\n\n3. \"I will help\" conveys a willingness to provide assistance to a request for help. It would imply that the person is ready and capable of meeting the request. \n\n4. \"I will be right back\" indicates that the person will return to attend to the request for help, but cannot immediately do so. It may be possible to respond to a request for help because the person can temporarily avoid other activities and commitments.\n\n5. \"I can't help\", is", "answer": " 42"}
{"text": ": eat an ant D: invent a farm E: hunt in the forest\nOutput: 1: The question refers to the neolithic people and their hunger. 2. Hunting, gathering, and agriculture were the essential activities of neolithic people for their sustenance.3. The options do not include \"inventing a farm\" or \"hunt in the forest\" as possible solutions to the problem of hunger.4. Therefore, the best choice would be B: hunt for Food.\nSo the final choice is B: hunt for the food\n\nInput: Why do people get sick in cold weather? Choices:  C: The reason is A: air B: the temperature of the food and drink in the body C: the temperature of the room D: the water they drink E: the lack of fresh air\nOutput: 1) In cold weather, people may get sick because their body's immune system may not be able to function properly. They may also get sick because their body is not able to metabolize food and drink the way it would in warm weather. Additionally, they may get sick because their breathing and circulatory systems may not be able to adjust to the cold temperatures and may not be able to keep the body hydrated as effectively.\n2) In summary, the \"air temperature\" is likely the reason people get sick in cold temperatures.\n3) The choices given, \"air temperature\" and \"the temperature of the food/drink/water in the body\" are related to the body's temperature.\n4) The temperature of the \"air\" is irrelevant to the body's functioning in cold temperature.\n5) The \"air temperature\" is more likely to be the reason for people getting sick in cold weather.\n6) Therefore, the answer is likely D: LACK OF FRESH AIR.\n7) Fresh air is essential for the proper functioning of the body's circulatory, respiratory, and digestive systems. Without fresh air, the body may not be able to maintain its normal functions and may experience illness.\nSo the final output is: A: AIR - D: LACK OF  FRESH AIR\n\nInput: The most suitable food for babies is _________?

{"text": ": go to the store D: cook E: steal\nOutput: 1) In the neolithic period, humans' main source of food was gathering and hunting.\n2) The neolithic period had no stores or markets, and hunting was a hazardous activity.\n3) So, the neolithic person's solution would typically be to go hunting, since that was their main source of food.\n4) However, in this particular scenario, the person has no food and is hungry.\n5) So, they have no other option than to hunt for food.\n6) Therefore, the answer would be B: hunt for fod, as they have no other choice.\nSo the final choice is B: hunt for foof\n\nInput: The police arrived at a crime scene where the culprit was the son of who? Choices:  (father)  A: a cop B: the chief C: the mother D: the victim E: the husband\nOutput: 1.) From the given options, it is safe to assume that the culprit, or perpetrator, is associated with the mother or the victim.\n2.) The police, in this scenario, would not expect to find a culprit with a mother or victim as their father.\n3.) It is more likely that the culprit and victim would have a connection with the father or husband option, which implies that the perpetrator and victim are either a child or husband of the culprit.\n4.) Moreover, it is likely that the police would be looking for a culprit to investigate for a crime, not an innocent party or victim.\n5.) In conclusion, the most likely option that the police will arrive at a crime scene and find a culprit is D: the victim or mother.\nSo the answer is D: the victim\n\nInput: How does a computer store the information that it processes every day?

Looking at the choices, we observe that the answer would be dependent on what the neolithic person ate.\n3. Option A is not a solution, because it is not a form of action.\n4. Option B is not the most logical solution, because the neolithic people hunted and had the ability to make tools, they would have hunted for mammals and other animals to gather food, not necessarily hunting for leaves or grasses.\n5. Option C is not the most likely scenario, because grasses were not considered a food source.\n6. Therefore, the most reasonable solution is a combination of the actions provided under option E, meaning 'eat whatever' would be the most appropriate response.\nSo the final answers is E: eat whatever", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": ": pray to the gods D: learn how to hunt E: pray to the gods\nOutput: 1 The options given suggest varying time periods which are associated with different practices and belief systems.\n2. The question implies that the choice of solution must be relevant to a time period before recorded history, which in this context would be the Neolithic age.\n3. Out of the provided options, only prayer to the gods seems to fit the time period and context - the Neolithic people believed in the existence of gods and were thought to have prayed to them.\n4. Therefore, the answer should be given as D: pray to the gods.\nSo the final answered is D: pray to the god\n\nInput: In the end, who is going to die? Choices:  a B: the guy who owns the house C: the man D: the murderer E: the woman\nOutput: 1: First, we consider the options given. All of them refer to a similar context involving a murder, a guy who owns a house and a woman. \n2. In a murder mystery story, the culprit is usually one of the main characters, but the details of the plot and context determine who the killer is, who is going to be punished for their deed and who is the actual victim \n3. In this case, the woman is a potential victim because she owns the house in which the crime took place.\n4. Therefore the answer will likely be the woman. \n5. However, it would depend on the context of the plot and how the crime happened in terms of who is the actual culprit and who will be punished for the crime.\nSo the final answers is Woman\n\nInput: There are 23 sheep in a flock.

{"text": ": cook food D: forage E: create food\nOutput: 1.\"Neolithic\" means the earlier age of Stone Age, which implies that the person was living in a prehistoric era. \n2. Looking at the options given: Hunting, cooking, and foraging are all possible solutions to food problems during this era, however, the context provides additional details about being hungry, as in the question. \n3. Therefore we can eliminate the options A: thank god, B: hunt for the food, C: cook the food since hunting and foraging may be solutions to a food problem, but cannot be applied when one is hungry.\n4. Only the option D: forage which means to gather plant food and not hunt, matches the context.  The other options cannot be ruled out, but the given context is insufficient to differentiate between them.\n5. So D is the answer.\nSo the final answers is D: forage\n\nInput: The girl was excitedly eating a cake. The cake was delicious, according to the girl. The cake was a what?  Choices:  A : sponge cake B : spice cake C : cocoa cake D : chocolate cake E : chiffon cake\nOutput: Given the context of a  girl eating a cake, and given the descriptions of 'delicious' and 'chocolate cake', our immediate assumption is that it is a 'chocolate cakes'.\nHowever, looking at the options given, we can infer that the cake was most definitely some form of chocolate cake or chiffon cake rather than a cocoa cake.\nThe remaining options can justifiably be ruled out due to their description (not being a chocolate cake).\n1. Therefore, we can conclude that the answer is E: chiffon cake.\nSo the final ans is E: chiffion cake\n\nInput: At a restaurant a dish is being prepared with what?

{"text": ": farmstead D: eat E: garden\nOutput: 1: The neolithist people were hungry, so they decided to hunt for food.\n2. However their solution didn't work out well.\n3. The options A to E can also be considered as food producing options, however we're already provided with a solution to the problem of being hungry, so B and E can be eliminated.\n4. The term 'hunting for food' can also include options like catching animals in a trap or using a fishing rod. But none of these are mentioned in the option, so we can't say the answer is C or D.\n5. Option C 'fermstead' may refer to a place where the food is being produced. If this is meant, then this is not a solution to the problem and option e can also be rejected.\n6. The only option remaining is A 'thank god' which is also ruled out because they're trying to solve a problem, and not depending on some external agency to feed them.\n7. Therefore the answer is A: \"Thank god\".\nSo the final answers is A: \"Thank God\u201d\n\nInput: He said to the audience, \"I have something to say to you...\". The thing was that you need what? Choices:   A: a permission B: to speak C: a request D: an order E: a command\nOutput: 1 : The speaker was trying to make a point or talk to the audience, but the only thing he could get was an order to speak.\n2. He could have asked for a permission but that was not the case\n3. He did not say anything to the effect \"You need a permission to speak.\"\n4. However, he did ask for a request to speak, or an order to speak. The meaning is similar to request, but there are some differences too. Request is more like asking politely and with respect, whereas an order is a kind of a mandatory or an imposed requirement.\n5. The speaker also gave a command. So the choices were reduced to 4.\n6. There are some other contextual nuances also, but this is sufficient for the choice.\n7. Therefore we can select choice as D: an order.\nSo the final answers are D: Order \n\nInput: Why should we listen to classical music when", "answer": " 170"}
{"text": ": buy groceries D: go to the fridge E: go to the supermarket\nOutput: 1) Let us analyze the situation and context in order to determine the correct solution to this problem.\n2. The question implies that the neolithic person is experiencing hunger and need to find food, suggesting a time in the past when people relied more on hunting or gathering than on store-bought food.\n3. Based off this info, we can rule out options D & E as they wouldn't be applicable. A \"neolithic\" person would not likely be able to go to a supermarket or have a refrigerator to rely on.\n4. Options A & B do not make complete sense since a person of that era would not be able to say \"thank god\" or \"hunt for food\" as they may not have known such expressions.\n5. Finally, we are left with options C & B. Both seem possible for such an era, however, of the two, the answer would be C which implies \"buying groceries\" as this is more concrete.\n6. Therefore, the answer for this problem is C: buy grocerie.\nSo the final answe is C: buy grocerys\n\nInput: You make a deal with a guy for the price of a box of chocolates, and the guy gives you the box, but in your language it says \ud83c\udf69.

The answer provided was: to provide their children with essential nutrients.\n2) Hunting and gathering was a primary food source for neolithic people, not a secondary source.\n3) With this information in mind, we should look out for the word'source' which refers to their primary food.\n4) In the context of food,'solution' refers to a process/action used to obtain a desired/expected outcome.\n5) The options can be classified into:\nHunting for food = Action/Process\nThank God = Relation (God)\nPray for Rain = Emotion (in this context, Rain = Food)\nFind new hunting ground = Action/Process\nWait patiently = Emotion (we understand that the person is a hungry person and hence patient)\n6) Based on the context of food, option B (Hunt for food) seems the most logical and plausible answer.\n7) Therefore, the correct answer is Option B: Hunt for food.\nSo the final solution will be Hunt for food.", "answer": " 240"}
{"text": ": cook D: eat grass E: gather\nOutput: 1) The question is about the Neolithic Person, who was described as \"the first true human\" and the term \"true\" indicates that this person was different from other forms of life that may have existed prior to them.\n2. \"Was hungry\", states that there was a scarcity of food or hunger among the person.\n3. \"Solution\" is used in place of a verb such as \"eat\", meaning that the phrase \"hunger was their solution\" speaks to both the cause and the action taken to address the issue of hunger.\n4. From the options provided, \"Eat grass\" does not reflect a specific situation but rather, a generalized description of what may or may not have happened. It is not an appropriate response to the hunger described, as it does not reflect on the way in which the character solved their issue. \"Gather\" is also not specific enough to answer the question that is asked. \"Hunt for food\" may have happened in the past and might have worked to alleviate some of the person's hunger, but the character would have needed to have gone beyond that into a more sustainable solution. This solution is more specific and relevant to the context of the question. \"Cook\" can also be a solution, but is also not detailed enough to fully address the character's hunger and would have required the character to find a specific combination of ingredients to be able to do so as a true solution. \"Thank god\" is an inappropriate phrase for the context of the question as it does not reflect or speak to a specific action or solution taken by the character when facing hunger.\n5. Therefore the answer is: \"Find a solution to their problem that was not \"eat grass\".\"\nSo the final answer in options C: \u201cCook\u201d, and D: \u201cEat grass\u201d\n\nInput: A spy agency may not know who is tracking them.

{"text": ": gather D: plant E: farm\nOutput: 1.\u201cThe neolithic person\u201d indicates that the person referenced is a member of a particular civilization that pre-dates the existence of farming and agriculture.\n2.The word \u201chungry\u201d indicates that the individual is lacking food, which is a common challenge in a pre-agrarian society.\n3.Hunting often involves extensive travel or the killing and consumption of prey animals, which may not necessarily provide enough food to meet the individual\u2019s needs.\n4.Gathering food involves collecting food sources, and while this approach may be effective in certain environments, it may not be a sustainable source of food in the long run.\n5.Planting and agriculture, on the other hand, involve growing and cultivating crops and livestock, which provides the individual with a sustainable source for feeding themselves.\n6.Therefore, the most logical solution to the hunger problem of the neolithic person is C: gathering plants and agriculture, as this activity would allow the person to remain in one place and have a more sustainable food supply.\nSo the final solution is C.\n\nInput: Some types of meat are unappetizing and smell terrible, you should use what when cooked well? Choices: 1.

{"text": ": pray to god D: look for some meat E: catch some fish\nOutput: 1: The context of the question indicates that the Neolithic person was faced with a hunger problem.\n2. The options imply that they had various solutions to solve the hunger problem ranging from thanking God to praying to God to actually hunting the food or searching for it.\n3. There is an implied assumption that since the person was Neolithic, the solution would include hunting and gathering or praying to God, the creator of everything.\n4. So, considering the nature of the options, only options A and E can satisfy the above assumption. Option B is out because the question does not ask for someone who pray to god only, but also a hunter and a gatherer. Further, Option C is out because it does not involve hunting and gathering, just praying.\n5. Hence, the answer is E- catch some fish that the Neoliths do.\nSo the final  answer is E: catch some fish", "answer": " 81"}

A solution to hunger would typically involve acquiring food or access to food in order to alleviate hunger.\n4)The choices provided include thanking God, who may or may not be able to provide food, hunt for food, find a friend who may or may not have food to offer, take advantage of a hunting opportunities, or aid others in obtaining food.\n5)Based on the provided context, the best solution to hunger would be to \"hunt for food\" or if possible \"find a friend who may have food\". As taking advantage of a hunting opportunity or helping others obtain food is considered as a second best solution which could be given under certain circumstances.\n6)The reason for this is that \"thanking god\" or \"finding a friend\" may not always be a viable solution if the individual is on their own or in a remote area without God or other humans present.\n7)Thus, the best answer is D: find a friend/hunt for food.\nSo the final action is D: find a food", "answer": " 48"}
{"text": ": eat anything D: be patient E: get a job\nOutput: 1: The question asks about the Neolithic person, who was hungry, and how they solved the problem.\n2. The answer must correspond to specifics related to the food, namely what food was available to them and what they did with it to ensure sustenance.\n3. Hunt for food, get a job, be patient and eat anything don't seem to connect with the question.\n4. Thank god and eat anything have the potential to be the answer.\n5. While both statements do make sense, in hindsight we can see that thank god would have been the correct option.\n6. Hunt for food could refer to hunting the food themselves, which they weren't capable of doing as per the description (neolithic people were incapable of hunting animals; they used stone tools or other tools to kill animals). The only option that holds true to the description is thank god, implying that we were lucky.\n7.

The options provided are: 'hunt for food,''start a fire,' 'create tools,' and 'invent fire.'\n3. Considering the context, it'll be most important to look at the options most closely related to the problem and the solution that the neolithic people sought.\n4. Option A and option E: 'invent a fire' are both relevant as starting a fire or'starting an invented fire' would likely be related to the neolithic man's solution to the problem of hunger.\n5. Option C: \"inventing fire\" is the closest to the solution in terms of language and tone.\n6. Option D: 'create tools' is more related to the neolothic person's lifestyle and is not very related to a solution to a problem of hunger. \n7. Option B: hunting is also related to a lifestyle and not directly related to the solution of a problem like hunger.\n8. Therefore, based on inference and relevance, the choice \"create tools\" and \"invent fire\" can be eliminated.\n9. Therefore the correct answer is option E: \"start a fire\".\nSo the final answers are E: start a fire", "answer": " 22"}
{"text": ": farm D: cultivate E: herd animals\nOutput: 1.\"Hungry\" and \"solution\" both relate to the issue of food, so the question could refer to any technique used to find food or address food scarcity.\n2. The given options can be easily translated into food-related words and actions:\nhunting for food is equivalent to \"A: thank god\"\nfarming is equivalent to \"D: cultivate\"\nherding animals is equivalent to \"E: herd animals\"\n3. The phrasing \"so what was their solution\" also suggests that there may be more than one solution.\n4. The context of \"neolithic man\" refers to ancient humans living in the Neolithic age, a period of time marked by the development of agriculture and animal domestication.  There were three main food options presented in the question:\n\"B: hunt for food\" refers to hunting and gathering, which is the most basic form of food acquisition.\n\"C: farm\" refers to agriculture, which involves growing crops for food.\n\"D: cultivate\" is also related to agriculture, but specifically refers to activities such as weeding and plowing that prepare fields for planting.\n5. Based on these two points, the most logical explanation for the question would be \"B: hunt for FOD\" as that was the basic food resource available to ancient humans and was their most common solution to the problem of feeding themselves.\n6. Therefore, the answer to the question would likely be B: hunt for Fod.\nSo the final question is B: hunting for food\n\nInput: When looking for an aromatic perfume, it would be best to find what kind? Choices:  a. floral fragrance b. fruity scent c. earthy essence d. musky stench e. woody odor\nOutput: 1) The question is about choosing a perfume and the options given are all types of fragrances.\n2) So, we should choose the fragrance that will provide the most pleasant experience.\n3) The options are A: floral fragrance, B: fruity scent, C: earthy essence, D: musky stench, and E: woody odor\n4) Fruit and flowers", "answer": " 24"}
{"text": ": make a home D: make a fire E: pray\nOutput: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.......666", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": ": pray to god D: grow plants\nOutput: 1st question is to determine if hungry and then we have to determine the answer.\n2. When starving, it is logical for a person to eat the first thing available, which is food, and if food is not available they will pray for food.\n3. Thus, the correct answer can be either B: hunt for forage or D: grow plants.\n4. Hunting for food means harvesting animals and plants for one's benefit. When people are starving, hunting for food could yield results.\n5. Growing plants means raising plants in order to provide food, which is beneficial in cases where food is scarce or unavailable.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer can either B: hunt the food or D: grow plants\n7. Thus, the answer is either B: hunt food or D: grow plant\n8. Thus, the correct option is B: hunt food.\nSo the final option is B: hunter the food\n\nInput: I took a deep breath. My lungs were fully inflated. What is this word that describes the number of beats per minute? Choices:  a: metronome b: pulse c: tempo d: beat e: time\nOutput: 1) Lungs are not percussion instruments, so they don't have a percussion beat. Also, their breathing rate might be irregular, so the question doesn't make sense.\n2) We know that tempo is the rate of playing. Beat is not necessarily equal to playing regularly (for instance a march has a regular pace with irregular breaks, whereas a drum solo has more irregular rhythm).\n3) Metronome seems the most likely answer (the other four have different meanings). \n4) In the audio/music question we can rule out metronome because beats per minute is not a specific word with that meaning. So it must be one of the six words, which leaves us with tempo and beat. \n5) We know that tempo and beat refer to regularity, hence can be used in music, and the tempo is the rate at which you play your note or the number of beats you have to play each beat. tempo is also known as the pulse.\n7) Therefore, the answer is tempo. So the correct answer is tempo.\nSo the final question is A", "answer": " 13"}
{"text": ": kill someone else D: pray E: go to war\nOutput: 1) The first thing to do is to analyze the structure of the question. The keyword is'so'. The context of the question is that the neolithic person is hungry, which leaves a lot of choices for the solutions they could have had to the problem.\n2) Looking at the options: A is incorrect because thanking god is not a realistic or practical solution under the given circumstances.\n3) The same can be said about options B, C, D: they are all unviable solutions.\n4) Looking at option E: going to war as a solution for a period of being hungry is illogical and cannot be considered as a viable option.\n5) Therefore, among the choices remaining, Option E is the only viable, logical solution.\nSo the final solution is E: Go to war\n\ninput: Why would a young American want to go to war? Choices: \tA: to protect her home B: to seek revenge C: out of respect for her country D: to serve her country and be part of change E: all of the above\nOutput: First, we need to examine the options provided. A, B, C, and D do not contain any information that suggests a desire to \"go to war.\"\n5 A states that the person wants to \"protect her home\" which can be interpreted as a defense action, but not a war.\n6 B indicates a desire for \"revenge\" and war is often associated with acts of retaliation or an attempt to assert dominance over others.\n7 C talks about \"out of respect\" for her country which seems more like demonstrating patriotism than participation in a military conflict.\n8 D describes \"serving her country and being part of change\" which could involve joining the military as a way to make a contribution, but it doesn'the necessarily indicate a desire to \"go\" to war.\n9 E encompasses all of the other qualities mentioned in the options, therefore it could be the only possible answer.\n10 Therefore, the final answer is option E: All of the above.\nSo the final choice is E: All of the Above.\n\ninput: The student's professor had high expectations, but the student was unable to meet those expectations. Choices:  A.  The student", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": ": ask a friend D: ask the lord E: ask the wold\nOutput: The key aspect to consider in the question is the hunger of the neolithic person. It is evident that the person was hungry and there was a need to solve the problem.\n1. The options presented are diverse and can be related to different aspects of food, such as gathering it, hunting it, asking for it, and asking God for it, but they cannot all be related to hunger.\n2. Option B'hunt' seems like a viable choice because hunting is usually associated with food and may be a solution to hunger.\n3. However, we need to consider the time frame, which indicates that this is a neolithic society, meaning that hunting was probably not a solution.\n4. Similarly, option C'ask a friend' cannot be an option because friends weren't known in that time period.\n5. Option C'ask God' seems logical as prayer may have been a form of asking for help, but it is not likely to be a solution to hungerness.\n6. Option D'ask the Lord' is a variation of an option mentioned above, 'ask God', which has been ruled out.\n7. Option D'ask a Lord' indicates a relationship with a Lord and perhaps a prayer for relief from hunger. The Lord could be the God, but it could also be a leader or ruler of some kind.\n8. Option E'ask the wold' may be a play on 'ask a friend' but the context is clearly not one of friendship. \n9. Therefore, from the options provided, we conclude that the answer must be B: Hunt for food and/or B: hunt for other members of the society who can hunt to solve the problem of hunger.\nSo the final is A: Hunt for food\n\nInput: John had a hard day,  He needed some cheery,  How could he help himself?

It implies happiness or joy, which John is clearly lacking in the context of the day he had.\n1. There are a few", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": plant a wheatfield D: bake bread E: grow herding\nOutput: 1) The question is asking about the solution a neolithic person had to a food shortage.\n2) It can be deducted that the person is hungry, hence it's natural for them to seek food.\n3) The question also hints at a previous solution; therefore, it's not likely that they would use the same solution a second time.\n4) There is an option that says to \u2018thank god\u2019, but thanking someone wouldn't likely be a real solution to feeding oneself.\n5) The other options listed are all actions that a person could take to gain control over their food intake.\n6) Among these options, planting a wheatfield would be the most fitting solution to a food shortage and would likely solve the neolithic person's problem.\n7) Additionally, it is not specified which time period one is referring to.\n8) Therefore, the answer to the question would be Planting a wheatfield.\nSo the final answe is C: plant a wheatefi\n\nInput: Why did Tarzan's mother kill his favorite elephant?  She thought he would get so much sadness.  She said she was sorry, but that she had to do what? Choices: A: let him have the meat to eat B: make him stop crying C: put it to death D: kill it for fun E: keep other animals from finding it\nOutput: 1 The first question asks us to identify the reason why Tarzan's favorite elephant was killed. Based on the context, the elephant was killed by the mother of Tarzan, which implies that the mother had a significant role in the elephant's death.\n2 The questions and answers are not in chronological order, so we are not given any additional information about the death of the elephant.\n3 However, we can draw an inference based on Tarzan's reaction. Tarzan is described as being \"very sad,\" which implies that there was something special or special about the elephant he was upset about\n4 Answer choices A and B refer to the act of killing the elephant itself and the mother's intentions for doing it.\n5 Answer choices C, D, and E are based on", "answer": " 48"}
{"text": ": use farming methods D: go to market E: go for fishing\nOutput: 1) By understanding the question, we find that the neolithic person is hungry and is looking for a solution to the problem.\n2) There are six options given which can be used as a solution to the problem of starvation or famine.\n3) Looking at the options, \"use farming methods\" and \"go to market\" are the best possible options  for the problem of starvations.\n4) Option A \"thank god\" is not a realistic solution to the problem of hunger and starvation.\n5) Similarly, option B \"hunting for food\" is neither an effective nor practical solution to the problem. \n6) Next, option D \"use farming methods\", seems to be a good solution for the problem of starving.\n7) Option E \"go fishing\" is also a possible solution to the problem of famine and food scarcity, although it is not the best.\n\n8) Based on the understanding of the problem and the provided options, we can infer that the answer to the question is either C \"use farming methods as solutions to the problem\" or E \"go fishing as solutions to the problem\".\n9) Therefore, the correct answer is E \"go fishing\".\nSo the final answers are either E \"go fishing\", or C.", "answer": " 121"}
{"text": ": try to find D: leave the place E: find solution\nOutput: 1) The question is about the neolithic person, who is described as being \"hungry\" and searching for a solution.\n2. Hungry people normally seek food, so we can infer that the neolithic hunter is in need of food.\n3. If left to fend for themselves, the hungry person would likely seek food and act on that need.\n4. Hence, the answer to the question is E: find solution - looking for food.\nSo the final answers is E: find solution\n\nInput: There was once a man who decided to build a castle in the sky.  What did he do first? Choices: 1. A: get permission 2. B: decide to build 3. C: take ground 4. D: start digging 5. E: buy plot \nOutput: 1: The story begins with a man who wishes to build a castle in an unspecified location in the sky. \n2: Initially, the man considers the idea of building a castle in the sky, but no further information is provided apart from the decision by the man to build a castle in such a location.(This doesn't necessarily mean he got permission to build a castle in that place) \n3: The man has the intention to build the castle, but does not actually take ground.\n4: The man does not begin with digging or any other preparation that would be required for constructing a castle.\n5: The man does not acquire land or buy a plot, so this cannot be the man's first step.\n6: The options do not describe specific details or steps the man might undertake to build a castle in\nthe sky, nor does it specify how long he will take to do so.\n7: Since the man's first action isn't described, there's no right answer to the question.\nSo the final  answer is no answer.\n\nInput: What is the best thing to do, is that they will not hurt you  Choices:  A.

{"text": ": find another place to live D: plant some vegetables E: build a fort\nOutput: 1: The question tells us that the neolithic person, whom we'll refer to as \"they\", who was hungry. They were probably living in the neolithic era, a cultural period characterized by a hunter-gatherer lifestyle.\n2. Given the specific context of the question, our job is not to understand the entire neolithic era and its culture but to focus on the solution of their problem, which was hunger.\n3. The key part of the question is \"solution to the problem?\", which requires us to look at the options: Thank God - This option is not a specific action or solution the person could take to solve their problem.\nHunt for Food - This option is not specific to finding food to solve the hunger problem.\nFind another place to live - This option does not specifically address finding food to solve the problem.\nBuild a Fort - While building a fort would provide shelter and protection of some kind, it may not directly address the problem of hunger.\nPlant some vegetables - This is the only option that directly addresses the need to find food and could be the solution they were looking for.\n4. The answer would be choice D 'Plant some vegetables'\nSo the final answer Plant some vegetables \n\nInput: You can't take it with you, what can you take instead?

The choices provided are: What to wear, what you know, what you keep, what to eat, what to give.\n3. Each option has a different meaning, but the question asks for an alternative to the phrase, so options which do not provide alternatives are excluded.\n4. What to wear - This option does not provide an alternative that could be taken instead.\nWhat to know - This option does not directly provide an alternative that could not be taken at the end of life.\nWhat you keep - This choice does not directly relate to the \"you can't take it\" statement.\nWhat to eaten - This choice does", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": ": cook D: forage E: gather\nOutput: 1.`First, we understand the context of the question.\n2. Looking at the options: The term' 'prblem'  doesn't exist in the Oxford English Dictionary, so it could be referring to a problem.\n3. If the reference to 'prblem' is a reference to food scarcity, then we could consider 'hunt for food' as a solution, but it doesn' t necessarily imply the problem was food scarcity.\n4.`The terms 'cook' and 'forage' both seem to refer to food and cooking and foraging respectively, but could still be considered a solution.\n5.`If we consider that solution as defined as 'a method of making a problem or a difficulty less severe or difficult' then the solution most likely to be a solution could be E: gather, though it is an ambiguous choice and may not necessarily apply.\n6. Therefore, from the given options, the answer is most likely to be E: gather.\nSo the final choice is E: gather\n\nInput: It's very easy to buy new clothes, but they make it very hard to what? Choices B:  D:  E:  C:  A:  F: \nOutput: 1.'First, it's important to understand the phrasing of the question. Why do they make it hard to...\n2. What does the phrase \"...make it... make it......\" mean?\n3.`It could be a reference to buying clothes in terms of convenience, as it's easy to buy clothes, but they add effort when using them.\n4. If we look at the choices offered, we can see some options are related to convenience, such as B: buy (they add effort in terms of using), D: use.\n5. These might indicate the real focus of the context (i.e. the question about clothes buying).\n6. Another option related to convenience could be E: wear, but it's not clear as it could mean more than one item of clothing at a time, which doesn't necessarily relate to buying. \n7. Therefore, from the specific context which seems to imply making the act of buying more difficult, the answer is A: wearing.\nSo the correct option is A: wearing\n\nInput: What does your mind do in the middle of", "answer": " 7"}
{"text": ": start farming D: wait for a wild animal to help them E: give up\nOutput: 1,2,3,4: The question is concerned with how Neolithic people were able to solve their food problem.\n5. We learn that Neolithic people began to domesticate animals, grow crops, and trade with other people.\n6. Based on this information, we can deduce the following about the situation:\n7. Option A: \"Thank God\" does not seem to be applicable to the context because it implies an act of prayer/thanksgiving, which is not related to the problem-solving of Neolithic people.\n8. Option B: \"Hunt for food\" is a temporary solution to the food problem, and it requires the acquisition of hunting skills, which Neolithic people did not have at that time.\n9. Option C: \"Start farming\" was the most significant solution to the food challenge that Neolithic society faced, and is therefore the most likely answer.\n10. Option D: \"wait for a wild animal to come and help them\" does not make sense because Neolithic peoples did not have the language or communication skills to share their dilemma with animals.\n11. Option E: \"Give up\" would result in their death, which is not an appropriate answer because the solution must be able to solve the problem, rather than make it worse.\n12. Therefore, the most sensible next step for Neolithic people was to \"start farming.\"\nSo the final answer was C: start farming\n\nInput: The pizza company has a new flavor of crust; what type of ingredient would most likely be used?

The crust of pizza is not typically considered a sauce.\n3) Option B: veggies - This is incorrect, as vegetables like", "answer": " 400"}
{"text": ": pray D: make weapons E: cook\nOutput: 1) We must first understand the context. The neolithic period was a prehistoric era beginning around 10,200 BC, characterized by the development of agriculture. At this time, people lived in caves or simple shelters and depended on hunting and gathering for their food. However, the question specifically mentions that a neolithic person is hungry. \n2) As the question only mentions the specific circumstances of a hungry neolithic person, we can rule out option A \"thank god\". The context does not suggest a belief in God or a higher power. \n3) Likewise, we can rule out \"pray\" as the practice of prayer and worship is not directly related to the circumstances of a hungry person.\n4) Looking at the remaining options, we need to consider the historical and cultural context of the neolithic period. The neolith is associated with the development of agriculture through the planting of crops and the domestication of animals.  Additionally, the use of tools and weapons played a significant role as hunting and gathering were common means of obtaining food.\n5) Therefore, the most appropriate options would be \"cook\" and \"make weapons\". Neolithic people relied on agriculture and the domestication of livestock for their food. However the question suggests that hunting and gathering were also used as a means of obtaining food, highlighting the importance of cooking and weapon making, and the role these activities played as food sources during this time.\n\n6) In conclusion, the answers given to the question are options \"cook\" and \"making weapons\".\nSo the final answers are A: Cook B: Make weapons\n\nInput: What makes the soccer game so popular in Italy?

{"text": ": get up and go D: start cooking E: go to a church\nOutput: 1) The question refers to the Neolithic period, which was also known as the Stone Age and occurred from about 10,000 BC to the end of the Mesolithic period, around 8000 BC.\n2) It explains that people during this period were hungry, which leads to the next step of deducing the correct choice from the given options. Option D: start cooking may seem like an obvious choice, but it didn't exist during this period as cooking was not a common practice during the Neolithic Age.\n3) So, option B: hunt for and E: go to a Church. Option A: Thank God doesn't make sense either. The answer, as a result, can be narrowed down to C: get up and Go and E: Go to a church.\n4) Option C: get ready and go to a church would have been the most logical step in the problem-solving process of the neolithic people during that period.\n5) Therefore, the answer is C) get up and go to church.\n6) So the final answer is D) get up and go.\n\nInput: The girl who made the first hot air balloon also made what? Choices: A: a bicyc B: a biplane C: a car D: a car horn E: a carburetor F: candy bar\nOutput: 1: First, looking at the historical context, the answer can be narrowed down as follows: option A: First hot air balloon is not associated with candy bars; Option B: First biplane is likely not associated with a carburetor as these are not typically manufactured in a single production run; Option C: First car could be associated with a \"car horn\", however, this option is unlikely based on the context of making other historical inventions.\n2. Therefore, Option D: First Car is not correct.\n3. Next, we consider the choices that are left: F: Candy Bar & E: Carburetor.\n4. Option F: Candy Bar seems the most logical choice based on the historical context.\n\nInput: You made an appointment with a client to visit the store, at what time? Choices: A) 2", "answer": " 5250"}

The question assumes that a neolithic person is hungry and seeks a solution to the problem of hunger.\n3.) The sets of choices are not all mutually exclusive so we have to find the best solution to the problem.\n4.) Let's try to understand the first list of choices:\n5.) The person is thankful for what they have, which isn't specifically a'solution' to the 'problem' they're having.\n6.) The person goes out to hunt, which suggests they actively pursue food, and therefore wouldn't solve the 'problem' of hunger.\n7.) We can exclude 'C: Plant and Harvest\" as it is referring to agriculture and not in accordance with the question.\n8.) Including 'plant and harvest' may lead to confusion as to whether this is a'solution' or a 'problem', so it is best to omit it.\n9.) In \"E: Eat One of Each\" the person has a solution to the \"problem\" but this can be regarded as a bad solution, which could be considered a 'problem' in itself.\n10.) This leaves us with \"B: Hunt for Food\" which can be considered a solution to the 'probbul' as it provides the person with food.\n11.) Therefore from the given options, the best'solution' to this 'problem' is \"A: Thank God\" which would be viewed as a bad solution by some.\nSo the final solution is A: Thank God\n\nInput: The person who likes the book 'Pride and Prejudice' will like what?

This is an indication that the solution was a temporary solution, as opposed to a long-term one.\n2) In response, the hunter-gatherers developed \"farming\", as indicated in option E. This demonstrates that they recognized a food scarcity problem and formulated a solution.\n3) Looking at the other option choices, they were not directly linked to the core problem or solution.\n4) Option A \"thank God\" may be a natural response, but it's unlikely to be the primary cause of their solution.\n5) Option B \"hunt for food\" is a natural response as well, but it doesn's indicate that they identified a food scarcity issue.\n6) Option C \"plant some seeds\" is a valid solution, but it's not directly related the question at hand.\n7) Option D \"find a way\" is vaguely worded and doesn't specifically indicate a food scarcity problem.\n8) Therefore, the best answer choice is E: farm.", "answer": " 99"}

{"text": ": eat whatever was there D: cook it E: find some plant life\nOutput: 1: The question first identifies a person who was \"neolithic,\" referring to a specific historical period in human history.\n2. This person is described as \"hungry,\" which signals that food is necessary for survival.\n3. The neolithic period was a time when humans first started cultivating and harvesting plant life for food.\n4. Therefore, based on these contextual clues, the best option to choose is E: find some plantlife.\n5. The other options (A-D) do not specifically relate to the neolithic period or finding plant life, so they can be ruled out. Option A: Is not applicable in this context because it assumes the person was thankful to God or something else. Option B: Hunt for food: This does not make sense for the period of the neolothic, as hunting animals or searching for seafood was not possible or the norm.\n6. Option D: Cook it refers to a possibility for the hunt for food, it is not specific to the neolothic context. \n7. Option E: Find some plant life, although not the only option that could be selected, it is the best bet given the context of the question.\nSo the final choice is E: find some plants\n\nInput: What is one problem in having a lot of what?

'Work' is not the same as 'food'. It is not something we eat and something that is not likely to 'go bad or dry' in a literal sense. 'Friends' would be the same, because we have many friends, but don't consider them as food. Furthermore, we can't say 'time' is food, nor can we consider it to be too 'full or heavy' (the intended meaning of the question) since it isn't something that we can eat. This leaves us with the term 'food' being the most relevant match in terms of meaning.", "answer": " 5"}

Huddle and fight is incorrect because, judging from the context, this is not the actual solution presented in the situation\n4.) Planting refers to cultivating crops and not digging into the grounds to look for food \n5.) Using a trapping is an incorrect solution because the question says they wanted to find plants and animals, not necessarily use traps on them\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Use a traps \n7. This means the Neolithic person wanted to trap animals and plants instead of catching them directly.\n8. In other words, the Neolithic used tools like nets and snares rather than their bare hands while hunting or fishing.\n9. This solution helped them obtain a more reliable food supply for themselves and their families.\nSo the final option is E: Use a trap\n\nInput: In which situation would a person most likely be in charge of a book?

To one person, it may mean reducing it by half while another person might consider reducing it by a quarter.\n5. He has taken steps to reduce the amount of debt by transferring it to a bank credit card.\n6. To put it simply, the amount of debt will reduce to zero or as minimum as possible. This suggests that he made payments above the minimum amount or made a lump sum payment.\n7. Option B is true based on his actions in reducing the debt by transferring the debt to a bank credit card, but since the offer from the bank had no minimum amount to be paid each month, it may result in an early closure of the balance.\n8.

{"text": ": gather food D: eat only bark E: leave area for food\nOutput: 1) The problem is about food scarcity faced by Neolithic people.\n2. The options given are either related to gratitude (A: thank god) or related to finding food (B-E), which hints that the answer is related to searching for food.\n3. After considering the options, we understand the answer must be something related to searching for food or at least, mentioning that food was found.\n4. Option A cannot be a suitable answer because the tone of the question is in contrast to what the text states about Neolithic people and the scarcity of food they faced.\n5. Option C cannot be chosen as it makes no mention of the scarcity that was faced by Neoliths.\n6. Likewise, option D does not offer any specificity about food or search and the scarcity that Neoliths faced.\n7. Therefore the answer must have a specificity to search for food or scarcity, which can be found in option B-C or E.\n8.

The options include alternatives to such grocery shopping solutions, and it is relevant to note that not everyone can be physically hungry at the time to need food, while some people might feel physically tired at times but not necessarily hungry, or might even have difficulty expressing hunger.\n3. Therefore, looking at the other options, D: go shopping, is the correct choice, as it is the only option that is associated with the context of the question, as well as not requiring a specific type of hunger.\n4.

The options point towards what the neolithic people would decide to do when confronted by the problem of not having any food.\n3) From the first step, we can identify the options that do not appear to be viable options for the neolithic man. Option A states \"thanks God\" which indicates a more religious attitude and a belief in God which does not fit the context of the question and is rejected. \n4) Option B states they would go hunting for food. Option C states that they would \"build a storehouse\" and so option D is rejected because this solution is redundant with the first two solutions. \n5) We can then identify the remaining options as option A (to wait for the end of the season), and option B (to hunt for food). \n6) Option A states that because the neolithic men lacked food, they did not have any food and would wait till the end of the season, where hopefully the harvest would be sufficient. \n7) But this solution does not seem to be viable because they are hungry, and so they would not simply wait till the end of season. \n8) Therefore, the first option that remains is the hunt for food. \n9) But wait why did that neolithic man invented the wheel if he was hungry? \n10) Because he hungry, so they invented the wheel.\nSo the final option is B: hunt for Food.\n\nInput: A baby crib, an overnight bag, and the back seat of a car what do all have in what?

The phrase \"hunt for food\" is associated with prehistoric societies that relied on hunting and gathering for sustenance.\n4. The term \"agriculture\" implies the use of agricultural methods to grow and harvest food crops, which was a major hallmark of neolithic societies.\n5. The question implies that the neolithic person faces a hunger issue, and the options given are designed to resolve it. \n6. \"Thank god\" refers to prayer and is not necessarily a tangible method of obtaining food.\n7. \"Stop eating meat\" is an option that may be relevant if the neolithic individual follows a meat-based diet, but is not the most likely solution.\n8. \"Make up a meal\" refers to cooking or preparing food, which is also not the main focus of the question.\n9. \"Invent agriculture\" is the most likely solution as it implies the use of more advanced farming methods to grow and harvested food.\n10.

We can check which option fits first: A: thank god. The option is grammatically incorrect and does not indicate an immediate or logical solution, hence A is out.\n4) B: hunt for Food. This can be considered as a solution, but it requires effort and skill, also it may fail if unsuccessful. Further, it may not yield immediate success either, as is evident from the context stating that they were hungry which could indicate that they ate at unspecified long interval before hunt. So, B can be rejected.\n5) Considering C: grow some. The idea of growing some or finding any plant can possibly be considered. However, this doesn't explain why it is the solution to the hunger as it might not yield enough to suffice. So, this option is also rejected.\n6) E: catch fish.

These are the two best answers, but \"hunt for food\" is an action taken by people when they are in a crisis situation, while \"make the best of what they have\" is a solution taken when people don't have enough for the problem they are encountering. \n5-Based on the deduction and analysis done above, the answer is D:- Take Action.\nSo the final anser is D: take action\n\nInput: The old cemetary of the old church was destroyed by the explosion. What was the explosion caused by? Choices:  a: fireworks\nOutput: 1: The cemetery was destroyed, there's no way it could be destroyed just by light fireworks or by an explosion from any explosives used as an attack. 2: This leaves us with b : firearm, where the attack was made using firearm for destruction and the church wasn't just targeted, it was targeted while the cemetary's destruction was also an intended part of the plan. \n3: The cemetary wasn't just destroyed by the explosion from the firearms, as the people there could've survived if it was something they could've fought back. 4: This leaves us with e : bomb, which indicates a bomb attack and not random people firing bullets or using explosives to attack the church and the cemetary.\n5: Bombs can be remotely detonated either by pressure or by remote control and therefore, the bomb attack could have been planned somewhere and the people responsible for the attack had planned a place to put the bomb and when to detonate it. \n6: From these deductions, the answer is E : Bomb\nSo the final anwer is E: bomb.", "answer": " 25"}
{"text": ": plant food D: make fire E: grow crops\nOutput: 1) The context of neolithic people and their solution to satiating their hunger can be inferred from this question.\n2) They did not have access to modern technology and had to rely on primitive means to satisfy their hunger, as suggested by the phrase \"made out of whatever they could find\".\n3) Given this information, the options A-D can be ruled out as they suggest using various tools or methods, none of which were available at the time.\n4) Option E can be rejected as making fires is a relatively easy process that does not require much effort or skill, and isn't a sustainable solution to the problem of hunger.\n5) Therefore, the most likely solution is C: to plant food.\nSo the final conclusion is the most likely solution is that they plant food.\n\nInput: He asked about how to make the tea stronger.

{"text": ": build a fire D: gather food E: go to a restaurant\nOutput: 1.'The neolithic person' appears to be either a member of a tribal society or an individual in a primitive society.\n2. Considering the definition of \"Neolithic\", which means that an era during human history characterised by the use of polished and shaped stone implements, we can infer that the neolithic person probably had a need to go hunting.\n3. This makes options A and B seem inappropriate.\n4. The neolithic people probably didn't go to a restaurant very often, or ever at all.\n5. The neolithicate people didn't have fire, but they may have hunted and gathered food. \n6. So the choice D seems an appropriate one.\nSo the final possible option is D: gather food.\n\nInput: A scientist is trying to find the location of a microbe.  What does he do next? Choices: A: put it in the freezer B: put it on the microscope C: put it on the refrigirator D: put it on the slide E: put it in a test tube\nOutput: 1: The key here is to understand the context of the question.  We are told that \"A scientist is trying to locate a microbe.\"  A microbe is a microscopic entity that has no recognizable form but that can cause disease or damage.\n2. Looking at the options we can understand:\n3. A: putting it in the Freezer is irrelevant.  A microbe is so small that it will go through the freezer or refrigirator \n4. B: putting it on the microsocope sounds reasonable. Microscope can determine its size and whereabouts in the freezer or frigirator.\n5. C: Putting the microbe in the Fridge/Frigirator is not reasonable given the situation. A microbe is too small to even be able to fit in such place.\n6. D: Putting the microb e on the slide is a logical next step.  Slide is a shallow, thin sheet of plastic or glass on which a sample of living tissue can be placed and examined \nunder a microscope.\n7. E:putting it", "answer": " 74"}
{"text": ": ask for help D: share meat E: trade resources\nOutput: 1: The first statement tells us the problem was hunger, which was solved by sharing meat as it was the most suitable response.\n2. We can interpret the given options as possible solutions because the statement does not mention if the available options were viable in the given context.\n3. Option A 'thank god' indicates an act of gratitude, but it doesn' really answer the question about what the person did to solve the hunger problem.\n4. Option B 'hunt for food' could be an option, but it doesn' is a general action and doesn't indicate a specific and direct solution.\n5. Option C 'ask for help' is a possible solution, but it's not necessarily appropriate given the constraints.\n6. Option D'share meat' is a logical solution in this context, as hunting and gathering was the only alternative means of food supply without farming.\n7. Option D'share resources' cannot be valid because the person wasn't likely to do it on their own, they needed to hunt and gather the meat, which means they'd have to share their results and not resources which already existed.\n8. Option E 'trade' is not an immediate solution to the hunger problem. It implies the availability of additional means to meet the hunger problem other than hunting.\n9. Consequently, the best available option is D: share meat. Therefore, the correct answer is D: share meat\nSo the final answer the neolithic solution was D: share meat.\n\n## Bonus Question\nInput: If I were a clown to my kids, I would be who?

{"text": ": pray for food D: fish for food E: gather plants\nOutput: 1: The question implies it was a problem or issue the Neolithic person was facing regarding food.\n2. The Neolithic people may not have had access to agriculture or sophisticated growing methods, but may instead have resorted to hunting, gathering, or subsisting on a diet that was primarily based on plant-based food sources.\n3. Looking at the options and considering their likely relevance in the context, we can eliminate C and D, as they suggest methods that are not necessarily associated with the Neolithic period.\n4. The choices A and B both suggest that the Neolithic people prayed for food or thanked god for food.\n5. However, the Neolithic era was a pre-agrarian period, and may not have included the practise of praying to a deity, and instead relied on other practices to obtain and sustain food sources.\n6. Option A 'thank god' should be eliminated from our choices as the Neolithic culture didn't focus on religion in that way. Options B 'hunt for food' doesn't seem to fit in that era.\n7. The final option E 'gather plants' is the most suitable answer as it describes the way of life that the Neolithc people followed to sustain themselves and meet their nutritional requirements.\n8. The answer is E: gather plants.\nSo the final awnser is E: gather plants\n\nInput: Why didn't the princess ask the magician for advice? Choices: 1. She didn't want to seem weak. 2.

{"text": ": wait D: grow food E: pray\nOutput: 1.'Grow food' would make a lot of sense in this case, as it would have provided a solution to the hunger problem faced by the neolithic people.\n2. 'Growing food' is also a long-term solution, as it would have enabled the neolithic community to have a consistent food source.\n3. The other options mentioned in the questions are 'hunt for food', 'pray', 'thank God', and 'wait'.\n4. As these are described as solutions, they are not the correct answers.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is A: grow food.\nSo the final solution is A: grow food\n\nInput: A bouncing ball is a toy, what's a cat?

{"text": ": pray to god D: grow plants or veggies E: work hard at agriculture\nOutput: 1-2. The problem that arises is that the neolithic person is hungry and there is an assumption that they do not have any food to eat. \n3-4. The options provided represent the possible solutions to the given problem. \n5. The first option 'thank god' is not probable as neolithic people did not believe in religion or pray to gods. \n6. The second option 'to hunt for food' does not necessarily mean that the only solution would be to hunt for food, there are other options such as growing plants or vegetables, praying to god, or working hard at agriculture. \n7. The third option 'to pray to god' does not take into account the fact that neolithic people may not have been religious or pray to gods, so it is not a suitable option. \n8. The fourth option 'grow plants or vegetables' is a viable option and would be the most likely solution used by neolithic people.\n9. The final option 'work hard at agriculture' is a likely option as neolithic peoples primary occupation was agriculture and they were likely to have worked hard at it.\n10. Therefore, from these options, the most likely solution used was 'grow plants or veggies'. \nSo the final answer us D: grow plants or vegetables\n\nInput: The teacher will make my grades better if I what?

{"text": ": store food D: grow vegetables E: catch fish\nOutput: 10. The neolithic age was a time period characterized by a transition from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to agricultural practices.\n2. This shift in lifestyle was driven by several factors, one of which was the need to secure a reliable food supply.\n3. One way that the neolithic person attempted to solve this problem was by hunting for food.\n4. Another way was to store food.\n5. Another way was to grow vegetables.\n6. The final way was to catch fish.\n7. Based on the context, it seems that the neolithics were able to overcome this problem through growing their own vegetables (E: catch fish), which provides a viable food source and increases stability.\n8. Option B: Hunt for food seems to be more effective when there is a scarcity of food supply in a particular location, but is less effective when there is sufficient supply. \n9. Therefore, it's likely that the neolithical people were able to overcome the problem through Option E: Growing their own vegetables.\nSo the final outcome is E: growing their own vegetables. \n\nInput: Which of these is most likely to be found on an industrial engineer's drawing?

{"text": ": plant the seeds D: share the seeds E: wait and see if the plants have any flowers\nOutput: 1) The question asks what the neolithic person did to solve their hunger pangs.\n2) From the problem we can deduce that the neolithic persons were facing hunger and they were not living off of their hunter-gatherer ways.\n3) They did not have the technology of today so the options they would be have used would be those they had.\n4) Option A can be eliminated because that kind of thinking didn't exist as it was considered a blessing and not a way to deal with a problem.\n5) Option B can also be eliminated as the neolithic man is not a hunter-gather but an agriculturalist. So, hunting would have been out of the question.\n6) Option C is eliminated as planting seeds would not have solved the food problem, and that was not their choice.\n7) Given this, the options are narrowed down to 1. Eat the plants that grow in that field or 2. Share the seeds.\n8) Option E can be eliminated because it's not logical to wait for and see if the plants are going to bear any flowers.\n9) Option D can also be eliminated because it was not the choice of the Neolithic man as this would have meant sharing his seeds with his neighbors.\n10) Option C can be eliminated as it is the choice of the neolithic mans and his kind didn't have agricultural techniques at their disposal so that would not have been the obvious choice.\n11) Coming down to the final choices, Option B is eliminated as it is not applicable.\n12) Option C is eliminating because it is applicable in our way of agricultural techniques but it was not applicable in the neolithic time and he did not have the choice to pick them as the option did not exist in that time.\n13) Coming down to one final option, the answer would have to be A: thank God.\nSo the final option is A: thank God\n\nInput: My dog won't eat anything that doesn't look appetizing,  I can tell her that it's what's for what?

{"text": ": make fire D: gather berries E: gather fruit\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" could be a group of people, such as members of a tribe, or it could be one individual, such as a member of a family. The use of \"he\" suggests that the person in question is an individual person who is going hungry.\n2. The phrase \"The neolithic man was hungry\" is used in the past tense to describe a specific point in history, not a current event.\n3. Hunting for food, which was a common practice for many cultures in the neolithic period and is a popular activity in many modern hunting communities.\n4. However, making fire and gathering berries or fruit, which are also often used to fill bellies after hunting or gathering, were also common practices.\n5. The specific options provided indicate that hunting for food may have been the most common strategy in terms of time and effort required, but all are options that could be used to feed oneself.\n6.

Choices A: confident B: communicative C: talkative D: eloquent E: talkative\nOutput: 1 The question recounts that the \"woman\" is \"a little shy in communicat[ing her] ideas to the group\".\n2. This indicates that the \"woman\", who is likely to be a member of the group, is often hesitant to express her thoughts and views.\n3. The question then asks us to identify what the woman could be \"a lot more\" of.\n4. Based on the information given we can infer that the woman is likely seeking to be more \"communicative\" or \"confident\".\n5. Both options A and B are synonyms for \"communicative\", suggesting that the woman is seeking to be more open in her communication.\n6. However, option B \"communicative\" is already an adjective describing the woman as being slightly communicative, so it may not be the correct answer. Option C \"talkative\" is also a synonym for \"communicative\",", "answer": " 230"}
{"text": ": build a fire D: start a fire E: find fire\nOutput: 1.'The neolithic person' as described in the question possesses characteristics such as a \"hungry\" and a \"problem\" with \"finding food\", indicating that these are key areas of concern.\n2. From their current condition, which involves having a \"problem\" with having to \"find food\", we can infer that their most common solution would be to \"start a fire,\" as this would solve two problems simultaneously.\n3. Option A 'Thank God' may have been used in some instances by the neolithic person, but it would not be the most common solution to their \"problem\" of \"finding food.\"\n4. The same can be said about the option B 'Hunt for food', which would require a significant amount of energy and labour, unlike the option of lighting a fire, which would require less energy and labour in comparison.\n5. Thus, given the context and reasoning, the most suitable choice that is likely to be used by the neolith, is the option D \"Start a fire.\"\nSo the final answer may be D: start a fire.\n\nInput:  The first time you see a fuzzy sweater, maybe it looks a little strange, but on  what will it look amazing?

The next description of \u201clooks strange\u201d indicates that the fuzzy sweat is likely to be first seen on someone with a distinctive appearance or who may not be aware of the style of the sweater.\n4. The use of the phrase \u201cwill like\u201d further indicates that the sweater is likely to be liked by someone who has characteristics that would make them suitable to wear the fuzzy", "answer": " 50"}
{"text": ": dig in a garden D: find wild plants E: find more food\nOutput: 1.` First, we must understand what neolithic means, which is associated with early human civilizations.\n2. Therefore, the Neolithic period refers to the time in human history when people were still relying on hunting for food, rather than farming or cultivating.\n3. This means the hunter-gatherer lifestyle was the norm, and people didn't have access to the same types of food as we have today.\n4. The options given could be used to describe ways of obtaining food during the Neolithic era.\n5. Therefore. Option A, thank god could mean prayer and may not be appropriate in this context.\n6. Option B, \"hunt for food,\" is likely to be what the individuals would have done in the past to obtain food, considering that the Neolithic people existed in a hunter-gathering culture. Therefore, this seems like the most likely choice.\n7. While option C, \"dig in a garden\" may have been used in the past for agriculture, it does not seem to be directly relevant to the Neolithic hunter-gathers.\n8. Option \"D, find wild plants\" may have been done during the Neolithical era to obtain food, but it would probably have been a secondary means of food acquisition compared to hunting.\n9. Option E, \"find more food\" as a solution to the question could possibly apply in the Neolithic Era, but probably would not be considered in the same context as the initial question about hunting and finding food.\n10. Therefore, taking all the options into account, the most plausible solution to the problem of being hungry in the Neolithical Era was \"BHunt for food.\"\nSo the final answer will be B: hunt for Food\n\nInput: What is the difference between mushrooms and fungi?

{"text": ": farm D: grow crops E: search for food\nOutput: 1.`1. First, we understand the nature of the choices given. These choices are related to food and agriculture, which are closely related to the neolithic age and the way people lived during it.\n2. However to farm an area, one needs to own and have access to \"land\" rather than the term \"crops\". To farm an area, one has to live there for many years rather than harvesting crops which are a product of farming. \n3. As there is no option for growing \"crops\" in abundance, the answer must be another term related to farming in a large area.\n4. Looking for \"food\" in a search context does not meet the requirements defined in the question so the answer must instead be \"searching for food\" which means looking for food in the wild rather than buying or producing. There is no option for that in the choices.\n\n5. We must therefore consider the answer to the question as being \"C: farming/cultivating.\"\n\nInput: Is it really easy to teach somebody how to drive a car? What do I have to do to my students so that they can learn how to drive?  Choices:  A : practice B: practice driving with me C: practice in class D: practice on my driving skills, give examples\nOutput: 1). The question asks whether it is easy to teach someone how to drive, implying that it may not be the case.\n2). The questioner suggests that their students can only learn how to drive if they practice driving, which would include both driving behind the wheel as well as being supervised by a driving instructor.\n3). The questioner is asking for the best solution to their problem of teaching a group of students how to drive.\n4).

{"text": ": find water D: make a meal  E: create fire\nOutput: 1) The question starts with the word \"hungry\", thus it is safe to assume that the person will likely seek out food.\n2) The term \"Neolithic\" refers to humans living during the Stone Age, which was a period of history when humans began to make use of stone tools and other implements. \n3) Stone tools were used for a variety of purposes, such as to cut or shape other materials like wood or animal skin, which could be used for hunting or building shelter.\n4) This means that the word \"stone\" in the question is likely to refer to the tools or implements that Neolithic people used for their needs / survival.\n5) This also means that the answer to what the \"Neolithic person\" would do in the situation of being \"hungry\" is \"find water\".\n6) In the context of survival, water would be a critical resource that Neolithic humans needed, as it would be used for cooking, washing, and drinking.\n7) Additionally, without water, it would be difficult to hunt or grow food, which were other activities performed by Neolithic people to gain access to food.\n8) Based on this reasoning, the answer is E \"create fire\".\nSo the final, logical and correct answer is E create fire.", "answer": " 30"}
{"text": ": cook D: beer E: find a vegetable\nOutput: 1-2. It's worth noting that the question states that a neolithic person \"was hungry\" and that they \"solved the problem\". This implies that they successfully found a solution to their problem of being hungry.\n3. Given this context, the only options that make sense are A, D, and E, which all relate to food. Among these, D is the best interpretation of the options.\n4. Option A, which involves \"thanking god\", is unlikely to be the correct answer, given the context.\n5. Option E, which involves \"finding a vegetable\", is also unlikely to be the correct solution, given that the neolithic period predates agriculture and thus would not have involved the domestication of plants.\n6. In contrast, option D, which involves \"a beer\", is a viable solution, given that it involves the consumption of a type of food.\n7. Furthermore, the cultural significance of beer in neolithic societies is well-documented, indicating its viability as a solution to the problem of being hungry in this context.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question can be inferred as D: beer.\nSo the final correct answer is D: beer\n\nOutput: The options are: A: dad B: mum C: child D: mum's birthday E: dad's birthday.\n\n\nInput: After graduating from college, he worked for a large company, even if he didn't know the reason why.

Choices: A: nobody asked him for his job B: nothing C: he wasn't competent D: he didn't like the job E: somebody gave him 50 dollars 2 dollars more and 1 day too many\nOutput: 1 and 2. After graduating from college the guy took a job. However, he left because he was not competent which is a good interpretation of he did not like the job.\n3. He did not like his work because he did not like that he spent everyday at the job. He would have the person that he loved being in a home with his kids and not at work.\n4.

{"text": ": invent a farming D: start a business E: gather food\nOutput: 1) The problem was identified as \"hungry\" and the options provide possible solutions to it, but the options are ambiguous in terms of whether the solutions are applicable to the problem or not.\n2. To find the correct answer, it's important to understand the time-frame and context of the problem. Given that the problem was stated as \"hungry\", it can be inferred that the problem being solved is a short-term one, likely associated with food scarcity.\n3. Option A \"Thank God\" seems irrelevant to the problem and is simply a generic positive response to solving a problem; Option B \"Hunt for Food\" is likely a short-term solution for food scarcity but does not solve the broader problem of a longer-term food supply; Option C \"Invent a Farming\" is again associated with food scarcity but would not have been an immediate solution in the given time frame; Option D \"Start a Business\" is unlikely to be the solution in the given timeframe and is associated with longer-term goals and plans; Option E \"Gather Food\" is the most logical and straightforward solution in the given time-frame and is associated with food scarcity, but it is still more of a short-term solution.\n4. Given the context and the options, the correct answer is most likely to be E: Gather Food.\nSo the final outcome is E: gather food\n\nInput: Some people are great at reading books from cover to what?

The given options don't specify any certain genre or section on a book, which means the answer could be anything between 'beginning', 'end', 'title', 'inside', and 'author'.\n3.) The way forward is to identify the context of the question in terms of books and reading to determine the most suitable answer. \n4.) The phrasing 'from cover to what' could refer to several book sections, such as 'from the cover to the author' (or the title, inside, etc.)\n5.)

{"text": ": gather food D: fish E: cook\nOutput: 1.) The question talks about neolithic people, their hunger, and their \"solution\" to the problem.\n2.) The answer can be deduced by taking into account the context of the problem and the options provided.\n3.) The options mention God, hunting, gathering, fishing, and cooking, so we need to consider all these options and analyze their relevance to the problem.\n4.) Hunting is a solution to get food, but as this is about a Neolithic person, not hunting is a logical option.\n5.) Gathering refers to harvesting and gathering food, but as gathering can be included under cooking, it's not a valid option this time.\n6.) Fishing is about catching fish, and not cooking them, so it isn't applicable.\n7.) Giving thanks to God is not an action to solve the problem of being hungry, so it's not a relevant solution.\n8.) Cooking, therefore, is the best option as it is an action that could aid in the solving of the problem.\n9.) The answer is B: cook for food.\nSo the final and the correct answer is B: cook\n\nInput: Which is the best way of dealing with a bully? Choices: 1. A: Flip them B: Talk to them C: Walk away D: Stand up to them E: Ignore them\nOutput: 1) A bully is someone who harasses or uses violence against another individual or a group of individuals.\n2. Bullying can be prevented by addressing it immediately when it happens, which is why the options present a variety of responses to this issue.\n3. Response E: Ignore them indicates that it is preferable to ignore the situation. This means that the other responses suggested are potentially better.\n4. Option B: Talk to  them is about having a conversation with the bully with the goal of resolving the issue or getting them to stop bullying.\n5. Option C: Walk away is about leaving the situation and not engaging with the bully.\n6. Option Flip them is not directly related to bullying, as it's unclear whether it refers to the bully or the victim.\n7. Option Stand up to them is about confronting", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": ": kill more animals than usual D: inventing agriculture E: use sticks and tools\nOutput: 1The main objective of the question is to identify the correct solution for hunger, so we first need to understand what the different choices represent.\n2. The options are based on the time period in which the neolithic period was present, so the answer could be from any of these periods.\n3. Of choice A: \"thank god\", we can understand the idea that the neolithic person could have prayed or expressed their gratitude about the food they had.\n4. However, this doesn't solve the food crisis.\n5. Looking at choice B, \"hunting for food\", we can understand that the neolithics would have gone out in search of food either on their own or in groups.\n6. But again, hunting was not the ideal solution because there may not be adequate food to serve everyone.\n7. Choice C \"killing more animals than usual\" is likely not a viable option unless the neolithic population was in a constant battle with other animals. Otherwise this strategy may not be effective or sustainable.\n8. Choice D \"inventing agriculture\" would have been a more suitable option, as it would have led to a more effective and sustainable food production system for the neolithic people.\n9. Choice E \"use sticks and tools\" is an idea of using simple tools to hunt and gather food, but again, it's not a long-term solution and not necessarily in favor of agriculture.\n10. Therefore, the answer that fits best is choice D, \"inventing agricultural \", which would have been a more viable option for solving the food problem effectively and in a sustainable manner.\nSo the final solution is D: Inventing agricultural\n\nInput: What did a panda ask for when being interrogated?

{"text": ": grow food D: plant food E: kill an animal\nOutput: 1)The question seems to be referring to the fact that the neolithic age was a time in which hunting for food was no longer a viable solution for a hungry population.\n2)The options provided are: \"Grow\" (option C); Plant\" (option D) and \"Kill an animal\" (Option E).\n3)Grow\" (Option C) refers to the process of cultivating and growing crops and fruit trees from seeds, which was not a common practice or solution for feeding large populations during the neolithic era.\n4)Planting\" (Option D) is ambiguous and could refer to any form of planting, such as the planting of crops or the planting of trees for timber, which is an entirely different solution than what is needed to feed a large population.\n5)Killing\" (Option E) refers to the killing or slaughtering of animals for food, which is not what was required to feed a large population during the neolithi age.\n6)So, based on the provided options, the best answer is planting.\nSo the final solution is planting\n\nInput: The company needs new employees.  Where will the applicants most likely come from? Choices: 1. A. Abroad B. From the local workforce 2. C. A new town D. Their own friends 3. E. The local college\nOutput: 1- The given context indicates that the applicants to the company are most likely to come from outside the local workforce as they are needed to fill specific roles that are only suitable for experienced candidates. A. Abroad: The question talks about hiring employees from places outside the local workforce, and thus, there is no need for recruiters to look for employees abroad. This eliminates A. Abroad as a possible choice.\n2- The local college is not likely to produce a large number of applicants who require more experience than what the company is seeking.\n3- This is not a case where the company is seeking existing employees to take up certain roles. As such, it is possible that they could source employees from among their own friends. This eliminates E.

{"text": ": pray D: eat an animal E: eat vegetables\nOutput: Options:\n1. A: thank god, B: hunt for the food, C: pray\n2. The question is asking about solutions to a problem by people of the neolithic era (40,00 B.C.E -2,000 B.C E).\n3. Considering the time period, it can be inferred that one of the solution options is pray.\n4. The other two options, hunt for food and eat vegetables couldn't be options as according to history, the neolithic people are not associated with hunting or eating vegetables.\n5. Therefore, the options that make more sense are 'pray' and 'thank God'.\n6. Considering there is a limitation on the number of options for an answer, the options that can be chosen are thank god and pray. But 'thank god' appears earlier in the question compared to 'pray' so the answer is choice c: 'pray'\n7. So, the final answer is C : pray\n\nInput: Where did the first person come from according to science? Choices: 1: The United States 2: Norway 3: Russia 4: Sweden 5: Germany\nOutput: 1: Where did the first people come from according to science\n1. Considering the context, the meaning of the first person is not directly related to what they are known for but to the science surrounding it.\n2. The first person mentioned in the question is the 'The United States' which is referred to by the US.\n3. So, this can be ruled out and we can move on the other options.\n4. Another option could be the \"Russia\", which is considered to be one of the 'Fatherlands of Peoples'.\n5. However, the meaning of the word 'Fatherlands of people' is usually related to where the majority population of the society come from, not necessarily in terms of where they were first born or the place of origin.\n6.

The context is about the prehistoric period, when humans relied on hunting for food and did not have farming or harvesting practices. \n2.) The question refers to the \"neolithic\" period, which is the point in history when humans began cultivating crops and relying on farming rather than hunting for their food. \n3.) The five options given are methods that could have been used for food preparation during the neolithic period.\n4.) \"Thank god\" is a general expression of gratitude, but it doesn' t provide any information or detail about the neolithic person's solution to their hunger or the methods they used to hunt or gather food.\n5.) \"Hunt for food\" could be a solution, but it doesn' not describe any specific food preparation method.\n6.) Option C, \"eat it raw,\" is a specific method of food preparation, but may not be relevant to the context of the question. \n7.) \"Grind grains into fluff\" and \"bang rocks together\" could have been methods of food preparation during the Neolithic period. However, the question does not explicitly reference these methods, so we cannot conclude that these are the specific methods used by the neolithic people.\n8.) The solution provided in the context of the question is about using crop cultivation and farming.\n9.) In summary, the answer to the question \"The neolithic person got tired, so what was their lifestyle?\" is to use crop cultivation and harvesting techniques, rather than hunting or depending on raw food as hunter-gatherers, which is the \"neolith\" period of human history.\n10.) There is no one option that perfectly answers the question.  Option C, \"grind grains into fluf,\" is the closest option because it could potentially have been used during the Neolith period, but it is not necessarily the best or most common method used among neolithic people, and is not directly referenced in the context of the questions.\n11.)

Additionally, the term \"source\" can indicate the use of various resources, including agriculture and hunting, to provide food. This is in line with the historical context and makes this choice the best option.\nSo the final option is 'find a source of food'\n\nInput: What is another way to say not a great cook? Choices: 1.

However, there's little more to this description that helps us understand what the solution entailed.\n3) From this, it's evident that the solution would involve a certain action that the neolithic person took in response to being hungry. By comparing each choice, we can evaluate which is most likely to be the correct answer. 4) Choice A says \"thank god\" which doesn't really help us understand any action taken by the neolithic people or solve the problem of being hungry. 5) Choice B says \"hunt of food\", which is a good start to solving the problem, but it doesn' need to be the only action taken to solve the issue of being hungry.\n6) Choice C says \"cook\", which seems like it would contribute to solving the problem of being hungr. It's possible that someone who was starving would need food immediately, and preparing food could take time, which could delay solving that immediate need. Cooked food could also be difficult to carry if one was travelling and unable to stay at one place for an extended period.\n7) Choice D says \"wait around\", which wouldn't really solve the issue of being starving, and is not likely to be the only way to resolve it. A better option would be to take action to solve the problem.\n8) Choice E says \"wait for rainy season\", which seems unlikely to solve an immediate problem of being starved. A rainy season could add the problem of finding food, especially if the person was in a foreign environment without the food they were used to. This would also require the person to remain in one place until the rainy season arrived. 9) Therefore, the answer choice that has the best chance of being correct is Choice C \"cook\".\nSo the final answers is C: cook", "answer": " 52"}
{"text": ": build a garden D: cultivate E: grow their own food\nOutput: 1 The context suggests that a neolithic person is seeking a way out of their hungry state.\n2. Due to their time period, it is unlikely that they would be well-versed in a modern or advanced method of growing food.\n3. They would have to rely on their own resources and knowledge, which were limited at that time.\n4. They would either need to hunt for food or cultivate food from their surroundings. \n5. The option A: thank god is a choice that emphasizes the idea that they have no control over their situation and have no options available to them. It's not a solution or a plan of action.\n6. Looking at the other choices, we can see that each of the remaining options refers to a method of cultivating food or growing crops.\n7. The neolithic period was a time when people slowly transitioned from the hunting and gathering lifestyle to a more settled and agricultural way of living. \n8. Therefore, based on historical context and the options provided, the correct answer must be D: cultivate.\nSo the final answers are D: cultivate\n\nInput: What does the author suggest for people who were born in 2013?

A \"lord of the mane\" is someone who owns a lot of land and is considered quite wealthy, often having a lot of power and influence over people.\n3. Looking at the options: A: thank God - It's unlikely that the neolithc person would directly ask for help from God, as many people are not religious and don't tend to rely on higher powers for help.\n4. B: Hunt for food - It's possible that a neolithic person would hunt for food, if they had the skills, resources, and time to do so. However, this approach could take a long time and would not necessarily solve the problem of hunger immediately.\n5. C: Take a rest - It's possible the neolithic peopel just took a nap to alleviate their hunger and wait until something was ready. But the statement made by the peoples implies a specific problem.\n6. D: Kill a deer - Killing a deer is a viable solution to the problem of hunger. However, it would require hunting skills, resources, and the time to hunt to catch a deer.\n7.

The answer will be one out of the given options. Thus, we need to narrow down the choices. \n5.\"Go to a groc cerey\" seems like the most modern option, while remaining relevant to the neolithic period.\n6.\u201cHunt for food\u201d is also a relevant action during the ancient period, but it is very specific.\n7.\u201cLook for roots\u201d and \u201cThank god\u201d might be relevant, but they are too vague to be useful.\n8. \u201cGo to the Farmer\u2019 seems like a very specific option, even if it is also very relevant, but it is not the choice given. \n9.\u201cGo to a groc, a cerey store\u201d is the only relevant action and it is definitely the right answer as it is the one mentioned in the problem.\nSo the final analysis reveals that the right answer is E- Go to a groc c ery store\n\nInput: Your body needs protein if you eat what?

{"text": ": start a fire D: find something to eat E: plant a garden\nOutput: 1) The context revolves around a neolithic person who is hungry and how they solved this problem.\n2. The five options provided have one thing in common - that is, all of them were solutions that were used to overcome hunger.\n3. The first option provides no solution, hence it cannot be the correct answer and can be disregarded for the other options.\n4. The second option 'hunt for food' can provide a solution, but it was not necessarily done by a single individual and could require a group of people.\n5. Option 3 'To Start a Fire' is somewhat unconvincing as the focus of the question is on the individual's action and not the other people.\n6. Option 4'find something to eat' is ambiguous and non-specific, it refers to general ideas rather than specific actions but still leaves an emphasis on finding food to eat, which can be answered from one of the other options.\n7. Option 5 'plant a garden' definitely provides a solution to overcome a hunger problem, but it's not necessarily a universal solution; Hunting, hiking or gathering food are also valid solutions, and it's not necessarily clear if planting a garden is the most suitable solution given the context of the question.\n8. From the previous considerations, the most suitable solution would be option 1 'Eat something to be thankful for' which is a direct and universal answer that covers the entire context and the requirements of the question.\n9. Therefore option 1 'Even somethin else to be thankful for is a potential solution' is the correct answer choice.\nSo the final choice is A: even somethin else to eat", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": barter D: harvest wild E: settle down\nOutput: 1: First, consider how the options are phrased. They all mention the neolithic person, so the answer must also refer to a neolithic person's actions.\n2. The first option \"thank god\" doesn't make sense in the context, as hunting food would refer to a \"neolithic person\" and doesn't directly solve the problem of being hungry.\n3. The second option \"hunt for food\" seems consistent with the problem stated and the options' context, but the solution provided doesn't directly address the problem. The solution provided would imply that the neolithic people hunted for food as a way of solving the problem, which is incorrect.\n4. The third option \"barter\" doesn't address the problem of being hungrv and, similar to the second option, doesn't directly solve being hungry.\n5. The fourth option \"harvest wild\" could be a solution to the problem, but it requires the neolithic persons to be at a location that would allow them to practice this task and, furthermore, would imply the solution had to be planned in advance.\n6. The fifth option \"settle down\" could be a solution, as it directly relates to the problem. However, it does not specify what was used as the means of settling down.\n7. Therefore the solution \"settle down\" is the best answer, as it directly solves the problem.\nSo the final answeer will be (as per the official answer) Option D: Harvest wild\n\nInput: To whom the phone rang?

Options B and C: could be possible solutions to look for food, however they could also be done by people in the modern era. \n5. Option D 'build a fire' makes it seem as though this is the solution to the hunger problem in the present scenario.\n6.

{"text": ": ask for it D: grow it themselves E: none of the above\nOutput: 1.) The question provides the context for the problem: The neolithics were hungry and looking for a solution to the problem, which the choices highlight.\n2.) Option A: Although it could be related to food, the context suggests it is a solution that would not solve their problem of being hungry.\n3.) Similarly, option B: \"Hunt for food\" does not directly address the issue of being hungry and is only a possible outcome of the food being provided.\n4.) Likewise, option D: The context suggests the neolithic person would be looking for a way to provide food to themselves rather than seeking help or assistance from others.\n5.) Option E: None of the options given directly addresses the issue of being hunntred, so none of them can be the correct answer. \n6.) Therefore, based on the provided information and reasoning, the answer is D (grow it themselves).\nSo the final answer for this question is D: grow it themselves.\n\nInput: There are many different kinds of chili sauce, what is the one like this?

{"text": ": grow some D: cook food E: use fire\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" is likely a reference to individuals who lived during the Neolithic period, a time in human history characterized by the development of agriculture, and the use of stone tools and weapons.\n2. The context of the question indicates that the neolithic person needed to find a solution to their hunger problem.\n3. The options provide a range of potential solutions that the neoliths might have used to solve their food shortage.\n4. The first option\" thank god\" does not make logical sense and is therefore discarded immediately.\n5. Option \"hunt for food: is a logical choice but does not specifically apply to the neolithic period.\n6. Growing food would have been a logical approach to the problem of food shortage faced by the neolithic people. However, the options do not necessarily indicate whether the answer was directly involved in using fire.\n7. Option D \"cook food\" is not mentioned explicitly, however, it is highly likely that cooking of food was a common way for the neolithic to fulfill their nutritional needs.\n8. Therefore, option D: cook food, is the answer.\nSo the final solution is D: cook food\n\n\nInput: The first and third are synonyms, what are the second and fourth?

Option A is not the correct answer, as it involves a belief in a Supreme Being which hasn't been mentioned by the author.\n4) Option B is about hunting for food, which is not necessarily an option for the neolithic people.\n5) From the context, Option C is the likely answer.\n6) Option D involves asking the leader and is a viable option for the neolite society.

{"text": ": find food D: store food E: cook food\nOutput: 1) The Neolithic person was described as hungry, and presumably had to find a solution to their hunger problem.\n2) Based on the problem description, the best solution that a Neolithic person could come up with would likely be a combination of the following:\n3) Find & hunt for food- In the Neolithic era, hunting was still a very common means of gathering food and obtaining sustenance. Therefore, finding food is a highly likely and probable solution to a hunger problem.\n4) Store food- Storing food for later consumption was a common practice in the Neolithic age. This would be particularly useful if the Neolithic person were aware that a food shortage was looming.\n5) Cook food- The Neolithic age did not have the same luxury of fast food and other forms of convenience food that are available to us today. Cooking was an important and essential way of preparing food.\n6) Thank God- This is an unrealistic and unreasonable solution for any Neolithic person seeking to find a solution to a hunger issue.\n7) By considering the context, the answer is likely A: find & hunt for food, D: store food, and C: cook food.\nSo the final solution is D: store food, C cook food, A: find & huh for food\n\nInput: We see that a big crowd of people were gathering at a meeting.

Option A is not appropriate as it doesn't provide a concrete solution to the problem.\n3-Option B refers to hunting for food, which could be used as a solution option, however, hunting alone would not be enough to satisfy the hunger of a person.\n4-Option C is a possible solution option, referring to cooking food and it would provide a concrete and feasible solution to the problem. \n5-Option D refers to becoming a farmer, which could also be used to provide more food for the person.

The boss of the company is shown to be a \"low-culture-loving\" Clown. This means that he is not highly educated and is likely to be a person who is easily influenced by things which are considered low or non-productive.\n2) The word \"harmful\" is associated with negative consequences, implying that the Clown Boss's interest in low culture could lead to adverse outcomes.\n3) The question then asks us to identify which entities are affected by the situation, specifically the boss himself and the company, then the firm, then the U.S. in general, and finally the customers.\n4) Based on the context and question information, the best answer is likely to be D: The Customers.\n5) Option A: Harm", "answer": " 209"}
{"text": ": go to bed D: plant some crops E: go back to sleep\nOutput: 1) Answering the question requires understanding the given context. The neolithic period was characterized by a culture that depended on agriculture to survive and obtain food.\n2) The answer can be deduced based on the question. A hunter-gatherer would not have been particularly satisfied with the solution to the problem, as they were accustomed to a more nomadic lifestyle and were used to hunting for food and foraging wild food plants to survive.\n3) A \"thank god\" solution doesn't necessarily apply to this situation as the neolithic person is hungry and needs food.\n4) Option C \"go to bed\" is a personal decision and wouldn't directly apply to the problem of food scarcity.\n5) Option D \"plant some crops\" is a feasible solution as agriculture was the primary means of sustenance during the Neolithic period and would have been the likely solution to the problem of food shortage.\n6) Option E \"go back to sleep\" is an invalid option as the neolith\nThus, the answer is D.\nSo the final choice(s) (plural) is D: plant some croPS\n\nInput: Which one of the following is not common to every animal body?

Muscle is also a common part of every animal, so it can not be considered something that\u2019s not common. Similarly, brain is an internal organ unique to all living things and it\u2019s found in all animals. Similarly, skin, which is a type of connective tissue, is found in all animals as well.

{"text": ": make a fire D: cook E: gather food\nOutput: 1) We are given one specific context for the question, which is that the neolithic person is described as being hungry.\n2) The only relevant information from the context is that the neolothic person was hungry and needed to find a solution to that problem.\n3) Given the context, the options given are meant to indicate the various solutions to the problem of hunger.\n4) Among these options, two are mentioned specifically with respect to cooking food using fire: the option'make a fire' and the option 'cook'.\n5) Of these options, the context only provides us with the information that'make a fire' was done by the neolithic people and only mentions briefly that 'cook' involved cooking food, therefore making 'cook' more likely to be a result of the solution than the option'make a a fire'.\n6) While it is possible for the neolithic period to be characterized by the use of fire as well as cooking of food, they were both a part of the neolithic solution to the problem of hungriness (hence two options may be relevant in answering this question).\n7) Hence, the answer would be option 'C: Make a fire', with option 'D: Cook' also being applicable.\nSo the final answers are: C: Make a fire and D: Cook", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": fishing D: plant their own food E: agriculture\nOutput: 1 First, we consider the context of the question. The term \"Neolithic\" refers to a period in which people relied on a hunting and gathering lifestyle.\n2 The only way to satiate the hunger of a hunting and gathering society is by \"hunting for food\".\n3 The options available do not match the context of the question, as they refer to activities that were not available or feasible at the time.\n4 \" thank god\", \"fishing\", and \"planting\" are not related to hunting or gathering and can be ruled out. Similarly, \"agriculture\" is an activity which was not feasible in the Neolithic era.\n5 \"Hunting for food\", therefore, is the only option that is relevant to the context of the question and is the best choice for the answer.\nSo the final Answer is C: hunting for food\n\n\n```", "answer": " 35"}
{"text": ": barter food D: gather mushrooms E: cook meal\nOutput: 1: The question is asking about how hungry neolithic people would respond to their hunger. \n2. The options refer to different activities that may be undertaken to solve hunger, whether it be cooking, bartering, hunting, gathering or thanking god.\n3. Considering the use of the word \"solution\", we can infer that these options are not limited to specific responses to hunger, but rather to various solutions/methods that may be used to do so.\n4. We can conclude that thanking god may be a possible solution, but is not the most likely one.\n5. Now, looking at the options from a logical perspective, hunting is not likely to be a solution since the question states that the neolithic person is hungry. To hunt, they will need to be fully mobile and fit, which wouldn't be a likely outcome for a person who has recently become hungry.\n6. Even given the context, gathering does not necessarily suggest as the solution since the question states \"how would they respond\", but not \"what did they actually do\". \n7. Similarly, bartering food would not be a likely solution since the question is asking about their response, not the activity they would perform. \n8. Cooking a meal would be a logical solution, however, it's not stated in the question, so it cannot be excluded as an option\n9. So then we are left with the option \"d: gather mushrooms\", as it would meet the needs of being a solution. Additionally, it fits the context of the question and seems like a logical approach to take. \n10. Therefore, the answer to this question is D: gather mushroom.\nSo the final choice is D: Gather mushrooms", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": ": be a nomad D: go to a store E: eat\nOutput: 1.- The question is about an ancient person and their struggle for food. The person in this case is described as 'neolithic'. So we can assume they lived in the stone age, roughly around 10,000 BC.\n2. The question is asking about their struggle for food, in other words they were hungry.\n3. We can deduce from the question that they didn't have access to a regular source of food, which implies they had to look for food elsewhere.\n4. The options offered are: Thank God, Hunt for food, Be a Nomad, Go to a store, Eat.\n5. Based on the context of the question, the options presented don't seem to make sense. We can't expect an ancient person, living in the stone age, to just thank God for their food. Similarly, we can discard the option of \"Be a Nomad\" as well. This option would be logical in the context of modern day lives or lives from a newer time period, but not in context of a life from such ancient times.\n6. Looking at the remaining options, the answer would be \"Hunt for food\", given the context of the question.\n7. Although the option is in the right direction, given the context, the most appropriate answer would be \"go to a store\". Given that they were hungry they would obviously go to a place where they can find food. This is a more logical choice from the given options for the given context.\n8. Based on the reasoning, the correct answer is E: Eat.\nSo the final correct answer is E: eat.\n\nInput: He was born in what century? Choices: 17th 20th 21st 22nd 24th\nOutput: 1 - The question is simple but requires logical deduction, given that we are talking about a person born in the 20th century. We are not clear about the exact year but we can still deduce the century he was born in.\n2 - If he was born in the 17th century we would expect him to be living in the 20-21 century. Since he is not, the correct century is the 22nd.\n3 - If he was living in the 10th century", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": grow new food D: buy food E: do nothing\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" refers to people in the Neolithic era, also known as the Stone Age. Neolithic people were nomadic hunters and gatherers who relied primarily on wild plants and animals for sustenance.\n2. The question implies that a neolithic person encountered a food shortage or was hungry.\n3. The given options suggest solutions that would have been available to a neolithic people to address the problem of hunger, including:\n4. Growing new food: The Neolithic people discovered that they could plant and harvest various crops, such as barley and lentils, which allowed them to produce more food.\n5. Hunting for food: The Neolothic people gathered and hunted for wild game, such as deer, boar, and wild game.\n6. But these options do not necessarily reflect or address \"gratitude\".\n7. Thus, the most suitable option for the given context is \"Give thanks\" since it addresses the aspect of \"belief\" that is necessary for dealing with problems efficiently.\n8.

Neolithic people were hunters and gatherers - they would hunt animals.\n2: We also know that they ate mostly meat, they did not eat pork and they did not eat fish.\n3: The questions asks us to answer the question \"So what was their solution to finding food?\n4: Now, one of the questions to ask when looking at these option is, which one of these options could a hunter and gatherer possibly invent?\n5: B, C, and E are very possible inventions that would assist a hunter and gather in obtaining food and surviving. So, A and D is very unlikely.\n6: A and D are also not very well connected to the actual question being asked, where as B and C.\n7: This leaves us with B and C as the most likely answers.\n8: Now, when it comes to B the hunter and gatherer population had already invented farming. So, that does not provide the Neolithic man with a solution.\n9: So, option C is very likely, as that is something that would allow a hunter and gather to obtain food, especially as a prey.\n10: Hence, the answer is C, find a cave.\nSo the final question is likely to be C: find a cave\n\nInput: Who is the last person in a book?

{"text": ": pick from ground D: farm E: gather\nOutput: 1.The question asks about the neolithic person's solution to the problem of hunger.\n2. The answer options suggest a range of solutions that could have been used by the neolithic people to feed themselves.\n3. These solutions would typically involve hunting for wild animals, gathering from the ground, and other ways of providing food for themselves.\n4. It is important to consider the context and the options provided when answering this question. The neolithic era was a time when people started to develop ways of domesticating animals and growing crops.\n5. As such, the question suggests that hunting and gathering were likely solutions used by the neolitithic person to address their hunger.\n6. These solutions are in accordance with the answers given by the options.\n7. It is therefore likely that the answer to the question would be something other than hunting for food, picking up ground, or gathering.\n8. As such, the answer can be deemed as D: farm, which seems to fit the context better than the other options.\n9. We can conclude that the answer to the neolitic person's problem with hunger was likely to be agriculture, which involves the domestication of animals and the cultivation of crops.\nSo the final conclusion is D: farm", "answer": " 11880"}

The options given to choose from are: thank god, hunt for food, move to a nearby village, pick a wild fruit that grows near him, kill an animal that was about to die anyway. \n3. Option A (`Thank God`) could be interpreted, but not an appropriate option for the context because it doesn't make sense for a hunter-gatherer person without sufficient resources to survive to have gratitude.\n4. Option B (`Hunt for Food`) would seem a logical response to the situation given the person's skillset and the context.\n5. Option C (`Move to a nearby village`) is not likely given the skillset of hunter-gatherers at the time because their mobility depended on access to natural habitats.\n6. Option D (`Pick a wild fruit that grows nearby`) is logical option in the absence of other methods for food procurement.\n7. Option `E (kill an animal that was about die anyway)` is a logical and efficient option given the context.\n8.

However, in the neolithiic time, finding food was a challenge due to lack of technology.\n6) Option C: work for, can only be considered in this scenario when the people can find alternative sources of food. However, in the case of the neolithic period, hunting was difficult due to the scarcity of food sources.\n7) Option E: use oak that was used to cook cannot be considered in this situation as the question specifically talks about the food sources in the neolithical era. Cooking is not related to those sources.\n8) Option D: use honey starter that was hunted fits best into this scenario because it uses an alternative food source.\n9) Therefore, the answer is Option D: use hunter starter.\nSo the final anwer is: D: use hunter for dinner.\n\nInput: He'll find the perfect one, and we'll both be happy.

The options given are in relation to using tools and hunting, suggesting that the answer should be a suitable solution for the given context.\n3. The options given are 'Hunt For Food' and 'Use Tools and Hunt'. Both these options imply going out in search of food, hence they could both be a solution to our problem.\n4. Among these, the option which is more closely related to the context is 'Hunt for food'.\n5. 'Hunt for Food' is a specific action that involves the use of tools and hunting for food, which could potentially be the solution our neolithic individual is looking for.\n6. Therefore, the answer options 'Hunt for food' and 'Use tools and hunt' can be eliminated.\n7. The options left are 'Cook and eat' and 'Go to town', neither of which necessarily include the use of tools or hunting, neither of which seem to be the best answer, and both of which can be eliminated. \n8. Thus, the answer to the question is 'Hunt For Food'.\nSo the final answer A is: hunt for food\n\nInput: What is the most important time to change the oil in the car? Choices: A: Right after it is filled B: Right before it needs an oil change C: Right before driving off a cliff D: Right before pulling out of the driveway E: Right before taking it to a mechanic friend\nOutput: 1) After looking at the given options. We can infer that all the other options are related to the maintenance of the car. \"Right after it is filled\" may or may not be applicable to all the cars, so that can be eliminated. Similarly, \"Right before taking it to a mecanic friend\" may not be a valid option. Some mechanics may replace the oil before the customer takes the car, however, this is not likely the case for most mechanics.\n2. \"Right before pulling out\" may be a valid option for some car manufacturers, and possibly mechanics, but it's not likely a standardized practice.\n3. Therefore, the most likely option is either \"Right before driving off", "answer": " 160"}
{"text": ": eat wild plants D: grow their own food E: harvest their own food\nOutput: 1 The question gives information about the neolithic people. These people lived in the era before agriculture became developed.\n2. Although food was plentiful in nature and they were adept hunters, they lacked a means of producing food for themselves, either because they couldn't invent it before the end of the neolithic era or because they lacked the time to discover such innovations.\n3. They could only find food in the available form or wait for the right seasons and rains to facilitate agricultural practices such as sowing.\n4. However, during unfavorable seasons or circumstances they had to resort to other options because they lacked enough food supply, one of which was eating wild plants.\n5. Option C: grow their own food seems the most suitable because it's a direct and efficient way to produce food for themselves; this is the solution they ultimately adopted to the problem and this is the answer.\nSo the final, the given answer is C: grow their own.\n\nInput: Who is a leader? Choices:  a person in power b A big mouth c Somebody who doesn't follow orders d Doesn't question authority e Is not afraid to voice their opinion\nOutput: 1, from the context we can infer that the question is specifically asking for the definition of leader.\n2. The given options are categorized as A: 'A person in power'; B: 'A big mouth'; C: 'Somebody who doesn't obey orders'; D: 'Somebody who does question authority'; and E: 'Somebody who isn't afraid of voicing their opinion' - all of them being qualities that leaders are supposed to possess.\n3. Therefore, a leader is someone who possesses all the qualities in one or more of the options. This eliminates many of the options, as not everyone is a person in power, or can have a big mouth, or doesn't take orders.\n4. What is often thought of as a sign of a leader though is 'voicing their opinion' and challenging authority. \n5. A leader should also not be afraid to question authority and should have confidence.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer option from the given set is E: 'Is not afraid to voice their opinions'.\nSo the final", "answer": " 140"}

Options A, B, C, D, and E are given as choices, none of which seems to fit the context perfectly. The choice of food seems to be the most appropriate option.\n3. Option A: 'Thank God' refers to having faith and gratitude towards God which doesn't seem to solve the problem of being hungriness directly. However, it is possible that the person might have had an attitude of thankfulness which would have led them to have faith in God or find gratitude in what they had.\n4. Option B: 'Hunt for food' refers to finding new sources of food which doesn't directly solve the problem of being immediately hungry. It could potentially solve a long-term food shortage problem.\n5. Option C: 'Cook' refers to the preparation of food through various culinary methods which doesn't seem likely to feed them immediately.\n6. Option D: 'Eat an apple' refers to the act of consuming an apple which could potentially solve the immediate problem of being hungry, however, it may have been difficult to have access to apples in the absence of modern means of food production and preservation. This may have been limited to certain seasons and geographic areas. However, in such cases other more widely available foods such as breads, grains, or vegetables could also have been used.\n7. Option D: 'Cook an apple' refers to processing or preparing an apple before consumption. This could have taken some time and it may not have solved the immediate need to be instantly quenched.\n8.

The options given provide some insights on their approaches to problem-solving.\n3. Option A 'thank god' doesn't necessarily reflect a solution to the problem, but rather a reaction to it.\n4. Option B 'hunt for food' indicates that they were able to gather food to solve the problem of hunger.\n5. Option C 'go back home' also reflects a solution to the problem of hunger as it indicates that they tried to find food at home before resorting to other methods.\n6. Option D 'fish' is not necessarily a reliable solution to the problem of food scarcity. Fish can vary in availability and abundance, and may not always be available when needed.\n7. Option D'start a farm' reflects a long-term solution to food scarcity, where people can establish a farm to produce their own food over time.\n8.

{"text": ": grow crops D: wait for help E: ask for it\nOutput: 1 \n2. After careful consideration, the answer is most likely D: Ask for it! The context of the question suggests that the person was hungry, meaning they required or needed food. As such, seeking help or assistance from others is a logical solution for their predicament.\n3. It is true that some people might rely on divine intervention or luck, but this does not seem to be the case in this scenario. It is more likely that the person needed help, rather than hoping for it to come to them or relying on a divine source.\n4. Option A: 'Thanks God' is clearly not an appropriate solution in this scenario, as the problem is a lack of food and not a lack of prayer.\n5. Option C: Growing crops is a solution, but it is not applicable to an immediate situation where food is needed immediately.\n6. Option B: 'Hunt for food' seems like an inappropriate choice as it is a solution that requires an effort and time that is contrary to the context of the problem - someone who is hungry and needs help urgently.\n7. Option D seems like a likely and most suitable solution in the context of the question.\nSo the final choice is D: Ask for it.\n\nInput: The city was surrounded by mountains, which made it difficult to get in and out at times, where did they have to go when they needed to get in or out?

It appears the person is facing a food shortage during a time in history when they had not yet settled into civilization or developed modern tools.\n2) This tells us that survival tools are out of their reach, meaning any solution they find will be primitive and likely have inherent risks.\n3) One option could be \"a: thank god\", the other options are (c) \"Build a fire\", (d) \"Make an oven\", (e) \"Kill someone\".\n4) \"thank god\" is not something that makes sense as a means to solve the problem and therefore is not an acceptable option.\n5) Option (c) \"Build fire\" or (d) \"Making an oven\" do not make sense either, given that these were primitive ages where modern technology and cooking utensils were not available.\n6) The only option which makes any sense, considering the clues and the historical context, is (e) \"Killing someone\", which was a common practice in those times and was used as a means to fulfill basic needs like food.\n7) So, the correct answer can be answered as (e) \"KILL SOMEONE.\nSo the final solution is E: kill someone\n\nInput: The doctor gave up on trying to talk to the patient.

The options indicate the potential solutions they could have used to address their hunger:\n3. Option A: Thank god indicates that the neolithic person may not have had knowledge or awareness of how to resolve their hunger, which does not seem plausible, given the context of neolithic people being highly skilled in hunting and using tools.\n4. Option B \"hunt for food\" is a solution that would be feasible for the neolithic period. It is possible that these people used hunting in order to secure their food sources and satisfy their hunger.\n5. Option C \"find and use tools\" is also feasible for the neo-lithic period as this is an indicator of the use of tools.\n6. Option D \"grow crops\" shows the ability to use agriculture in order to gain a source of food.\n7. Option D \"raise domesticated animals\" indicates that the neolthic people were able to use domesticated animals in order to satisfy their hunger. These animals provided meat and milk which could address and resolve the hunger pains.\n8. Therefore, the option that has the possibility of being feasible for the neothlcic period is \"grow crops\", which is reflected in the answer option D: grow crops.\nSo the final answers is D: grow crops\n\nInput: Who does a woman always answer to if she is in prison? Choices:  A:-the warden B:-her parents C:-her children D:-her husband E:-her friends\nOutput: 1 The question suggests that a woman in prison is likely to be in contact with other people, such as the warden, her parents, her children, her husband and her friends.\n2. The warden is a person who is in charge of a prison and is generally responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations, as well as the well-being of the prisoners.\n3. Parents are not a likely choice, as the woman is in prison. \n4. Her husband is also unlikely, as her husband would potentially still have a life outside of prison, even if she is incarcerated.", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": ": collect food D: grow food E: build homes\nOutput: 1) The question focuses on the Neolithic period and the hunting lifestyle.\n2) To stay alive in the Neolithic, one had to hunt and collect food from the wild.\n3) However, the options offered give alternatives that would be more easily available nowadays rather than during the Neolithic era.\n4) For instance, A (Thank God) or D (Build Home) would have been impossible to imagine at the time.\n5) The available choices are: C (Collect Food), E (Grow Food), and B (Hunt For Food).\n6) Out of the three options, we can deduce the following conclusions:\n7) C (Collect Food) is out of the question, as we do not know how the Neolithic person can collect food.\n8) D (Grow Food) is a possibility, but it has to be a certainty considering the Neolithic population's dependence on hunting and collecting food.\n9) The same could be said of E (Hunt For Food), as these hunts would make the population dependent on animals as food sources.\n10) This leaves us with B (Hunt For Animal), which is the obvious answer that the question points to.\n11) Therefore, the answer is B: Hunt for food.\nSo the final answers is B: Hunt For Food\n\nInput: To win a game, one must not cheat.  What is the most obvious reason? Choices:  a. Cheating is bad for your health b. Cheating is for losers c. Cheating is a form of lying d. Cheating leads to a bad outcome e. Cheating makes people dislike you\nOutput: 1 - In this statement, the key word is \"one\", which implies that the sentence is not about cheating in general, but one specific example.\n2 - The sentence indicates that cheating is undesirable.\n3 - This means that the reason is not just to \"get ahead\" or \"win\", as that would make cheating seem acceptable.\n4 - It seems that cheating is bad because it can lead to negative consequences (d).\n5 - However, this does not necessarily mean that the other options are not valid reasons.\n6 - It's important to note that", "answer": " 750"}
{"text": ": eat moss D: gather berries E: eat animal\nOutput: 1) From the information given, it is known that the neolithic people struggled with hunger and tried different ways to resolve it.\n2) The options provided are a testament to the diversity and versatility of the people in pursuit of food, but the question is about resolving hunger rather than trying a specific way to attain it. \n3) Option A: A solution of thanking God is not applicable because hunger is an issue that plagues people in need. \n4) Option B: A solution to hunt for food is only logical if there are resources such as animals and other wildlife. \n5) Option C: Eating moss is absurd and does not seem like a plausible solution to resolve hunger; Growing berries takes time and effort because berries do not grow without sunlight, water, and fertile soil. Therefore, it's impractical and not a quick solution to hunger. \n6) Option D: Eating animal can be a solution if there are resources, but the question does not specify or infer the availability of animals, and even if there are animals, they need to be hunted, trapped, gathered, and cooked over a fire. This can take time and effort, so once again, not a quick solution. \n7) Option E: While eating animal can be a quick source of food, hunting or trapping the animals is not a quick solution - they still have to be hunted, tracked down, and killed. \n8) Therefore, based on the provided options, the most logical and practical solution to hunger is to eat animal since it is the most direct and quick solution compared to gathering berries, hunting for food, or eating moss.\n9) Therefore, the answer is option E, to eat animal.\nSo the final is E: eat animal\n\n#### Instructions\nAnswer the following grade math questions.\n\nInput: To increase her level, what action would you need to take in regards to the video game?

{"text": ": look for food D: look for plants E: grow their own\nOutput: 1) Firstly, the context of the question is the neolithic age, which refers to the time period before the advent of agriculture and the domestication of animals.\n2) During that time, humans were predominantly dependent on hunting and gathering for food, and had to rely on the natural resources they found.\n3) Therefore, one of the solutions the neolithic person might have used to address the problem of being hungry was to \"hunt for food\", \"look for food\" or \"look for plants\"; the term \"grow their own\" isn't applicable as farming and agriculture were not yet introduced during that time.\n4) Option A, which is \"thank god\", seems like a generic response rather than an explanation of how the problem was addressed. Hence it can be ruled out. Similarly, option B, which is \"a hunt for food\", is an action, rather than a response to the problem. Therefore this option can be ruled out as well.\n5) Option D \"look for food\" is broad based as a solution and can be taken to mean a wide variety of ways in which food could be found.\n6) Option C \"look for plants\" narrows down the scope to finding and relying on plants for food.\n7) The given options do not indicate that the neolithic people could grow their own food, which is a modern solution which was not available during that time.\n8) Based on this reasoning, it is a likely response for the neolithic persons hungry predicament \"look for plants\".\n9) Therefore the answer is D: look for plants\nSo the final answer 9936 is D: look for plant\n\nInput: I really need what to have some free time, what should I do? Choices:  - A: volunteer B: join the army C: sit around D: work E: quit my job\nOutput: 1.) First, the answer must be within the context of the question. Therefore, the options must relate to activities that free up time. 2.) When assessing the context, the individual is looking to free up their time by not working. 3.) This is an important point as other options such as joining the army or volunteering would not be relevant here. 4.) This is because", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": create a garden D: wait for the sun E: wait for the moon\nOutput: 1 First, we need to identify that the question is asking for the solution that Neolithic people chose to feed themselves.\n2. Next, we can break down the sentence into parts and draw conclusions by making assumptions about the options provided.\n3. The sentence suggests that neolithic people were \"hungry\" and went to \"create a garden\".\n4. The garden option can be quickly identified because they were \"neolithic\" and were \"hungry\", but they still had to \"create a garden\" to find an adequate solution to their problem.\n5. Therefore option C is the correct answer.\nSo the final step is to create the new garden.\nSo the final answers are C: create a garden\n\nInput: What does \"driving home drunk\" mean in the context, Choices:  A. driving a car B. going back to the city C. ending a shift D. going home E. leaving your house\nOutput: 1,2,3: All of the choices can be narrowed down due to the context of the problem and because they were stated in the sentence in brackets or have been referred to in the previous line.\n4,5: Only these two choices seem to imply a different context or meaning. 'Leaving (your) house' seems to have no association with being drunk, while this would likely not be included in the context of someone driving home as drunk.\n6: Finally, looking at the question, it is asking about the specific context. The choice 'Driving home drunk' is referring to a situation where someone drives back home after consuming alcohol, but the meaning of the question is about what this idiom means in the broader context. It's implying a situation where a DUI occurs. \n7: Going with this assumption, we can eliminate the option 'leaving a house'.\n8: Finally, one may wonder why 'ending a shift' does not make sense. In this situation, the person in question may not be ending their shift after consuming alcohol. The choice could also be associated with driving back after driving for a long time and drinking to reinvigorate and rejuvenate after a long work day and drive back home without ending their shift.\n9: Therefore, the", "answer": " 247"}
{"text": ": starve D: invent cooking E: invent farms\nOutput: 1) The question is based on the premise that the person was hungry and is posing multiple options to highlight the way they could have solved the problem.\n2) Based on the provided options we can see that they were starving and searching for food.\n3) The options also highlight that they were skilled in hunting and farming which could provide food.\n4) We can see from the options that there was a shortage of food due to reasons such as lack of farms and hunter-gatherer culture which could be addressed with the invention of farms.\n5) From this, we can deduce A or C as the answer.\n6) Therefore, we can answer the question by saying A: thank god or C: starve\nSo the final answer would be A: thank god\n\nInput: He was trying to get a good grade on the test, but he couldn't because he was absent from the final exam the day before. His grade should be what? Choices: a: 75 B: 87 c: 91 d: 98 e: all of the above\nOutput: 1: First, we have to understand the question. In this situation, the answer depends on what the final grade is.\n2. We have to determine if the final grade is the only important factor, or if any other factors need to be taken into account.\n3. If the final grade is the sole factor that determines the outcome, then option A: 75 is a logical answer as it would be the result of subtracting the grade in the other exams by the grade in absence of the final exam.\n4. However, if any other factors need be taken into account, such as past performance or average grade, then option B: 87, C: 91, or E: all of the above, may be a better choice.\n5. In this case, the key information is to decide what is the final grade that he must have to get a good grade. A: 75 or B: 87 or E: all of above are acceptable. So, any one of them can be the correct answer. Since the question does not specify the final grade value, only what kind of grade is required for a good grade, the correct answer is any one of the above.", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": ": eat D: farm E: pray to god\nOutput: 1.) The question is discussing the neolithic person, and how they responded to a lack of food.\n2.) The options provided describe the actions of the neolithic people in response to their food shortage.\n3.) Hunt for food may refer to hunting for animals or other sources for meat and sustenance, which was a common practice among neolithic societies. However, this option does not specify how the neolithic individuals responded to their hunger, so we cannot solely rely on this option to determine the answer.\n4.) Eat refers to the neolithic way of obtaining food, primarily through hunting or gathering, but it does not necessarily solve their hunger, so this option is unreliable.\n5.) Farming refers to planting crops or raising animals in order to produce food, which was a more modern approach that was not commonly practiced in the neolithic era.\n6.) Praying to god suggests a more religious form of seeking help with their problem, which may have been an option for some neolithic individuals, but it does not provide a definitive answer to the question.\n7.) Thank god implies that the neolithic solution was to express gratitude to a higher power for providing them with food. Again, this response does not help us answer the question.\n8.) Therefore, the answer is A: thank god.\nSo the final answers is A: thank god\n\nInput: How can the best possible job always be found, while a good job can be hard to find?

{"text": ": gather plants D: starve to death E: eat whatever they found\nOutput: 1) First, we see that the phrase'so what' indicates that the previous statement (neolithic person was hungrey) is significant to the context of the question.\n2) The previous statement (neolthic person is hungry) implies that the people had to hunt for food. This can be understood as what solutions they adopted.\n3) The words 'hungry' and 'hunting' suggest that the people may have hunted wild animals or gathered plants. \n4) Since the people didn't have the privilege of cooked food, it's safe to assume that they ate whatever was available (plants or animals).  \n  This makes the answer to question B - eating whatever was available.\nSo the final awnser is B: eating whatever is available\n\nInput: A man's last meal consisted of only a loaf of bread and a bottle of drink. What did he have most? Choices: 1. water 2. butter 3. jam 4. cheese 5. juice\nOutput: 12. It's important to note that the man had a loaf of bread, which means he had a certain amount of bread.\n13. He had water as well, which means that he had a certain amount.\n14. Butter was not mentioned, so we can't assume that he had butter or any amount of it.\n15. Similarly, no information is available about him having Jam or Cheese.\n16. The only things that one can infer is that he had a bottle of drink and water with him.\n17. Hence, the choice that the man had most of, was water.\nSo the final choice is A: water.\n\n\nInput: The mall looks bigger than it actually is, because it has what?

The person was hungry, which implies a lack of food.\n3. The available options are C: use a boat, D: dig up food, or E: cook food.\n4. Use of a boat refers to transportation, but not the solution to the food problem, so it can be ruled out. Similarly, digging up food refers to gathering food from the ground, but not as a solution to hunger, so it can be disregarded.\n5. The option 'use a boat' refers to fishing from a boat, but not directly connected with food, so it can be ignored.\n6. The use of a boat for fishing was not a solution to the food problem but an activity that complemented it to a certain extent.\n7. Therefore the choice that relates directly to the food problem is the 'cook food' choice.\n8. So, the answer is E=cook food\nSo the final answer will be E: cook food\n\nInput: His car has a spare tire and other supplies, but why isn't he taking along gasoline?

The context implies that the driver was on a long trip, and the question is asking why they were not filling up the gas tank. Since there was gasoline available and the answer options suggest a reason not to use it, it indicates that he had enough to cover the trip.\n3. If the driver had no gasoline, it would not be possible to complete the trip using just one can of gasoline, as the question suggests.\n4. Therefore, the driver had at least two cans of gasoline, but a reason was given for why they were not using it.\n5. The answer options are A, C, D, B, and E.\n6. Option A: If", "answer": " 2"}

Even if he was using a sharp stick and made a fire, he would've been able to cook his food within a few hours or days, just without the availability of technology.\nD: Invent tools - This is the correct answer. This makes all the sense, while a neolithic human was hungry, his first instinct would be to find tools to help him catch fire, and hunt for food.\nE: Go to market - The neolithic man wasn't a part of the modern world, he was living in a world that we know as neolithic, and for him, going to market is a concept that is far too broad and undefined to be answered by him.

The context suggests a comparison between cats and elephant's, so we can eliminate options that do not have anything in common.\n2.) There are obvious factors we can compare between cats and elefants that do not involve driving ability.\n3.) There is a certain difference, but it can be used to deduce that the option \"A:they can't drive\" can be narrowed down and possibly eliminated.\n4.) \"they can't drive\", is a statement but lacks an accompanying reason explaining that. This can be eliminated.\n5.) Now that the option which says \"cats and elephants don't drive\" has been narrowed down, we can focus our attention on why.\n6.) There is obvious reasoning to be found in the fact that they are mammals and both require human care.\n7.)

The key phrase \"hungry neolithic person\" indicates that the person was facing a food scarcity issue.\n2) The question is asking for a solution to the problem rather than the problem itself.\n3) Based on the context, we can reason that the \"hungry person\" in the question is likely to be a member of the neolithic culture in ancient times, also known as the Stone Age or Stone Age period.\n4) The most logical option would be \"collect food\" as the neolithic hunter-gatherers would have lacked a complex system of agriculture and food storage, which could have helped them to store or grow food to provide nourishment for future meals.\n5) Another option could be \"find food\", as it makes logical sense that neolithic people would have needed to search for food due to its scarcity.\n6) The remaining options are either too general or out of the context. So, the most apt answer is E: get food.\nSo the final word is A is the correct answer.\n\nInput: One benefit of the internet is that the internet provides access to ________ when you are physically separated from them. Choices:  A1: music B2: songs C3: musician D4: artists E5: singers\nOutput: 1 First, the task is simply to know the meaning of the keyword in bold:\n2. To understand it, we first need to understand the context of the question.\n3. The contextual clues provided in the question suggest three important things: 1. Access to music, songs, musician, artists, and singers;\n4. These are all beneficial for people due to the Internet; 3. They all have something to do with people's emotions that could be experienced through sound in music form. \n5. Based on these clues, the keyword in bold can be interpreted as anything associated with an experience of feeling or emotion, such as music, artist, sound, etc. \n6. Therefore, the best matching word would be A1: MUSIC.\nSo the final ansnwer is A1: MUSCI.\n\nInput:  A: 22 B: 23", "answer": " 100"}

In this case, \"thank god\", \"hunt for food\", \"make flour\", and \"pray for it\" acknowledge the problem and express recognition of the need to address it.\nOption A: \"thank god\": This option does not acknowledge that the person is hungry in the first place, which is an essential step in solving the problem.\nOption B \"hunt for food\": This option acknowledges the person's hunger but does not address the root cause of the problem, i.e., the lack of food. It focuses instead on a short-term solution.\nOption C: \"make flour\": This option acknowledges both the person's hungriness and the root cause of the issue, i.e., lack of food. It addresses the problem by focusing on an intermediate solution, rather than a long-term one.\nOption D: \"bake bread\": This option acknowledges all aspects of the problem, including the person's hungerness, the root cause of the lack of food, and the intermediate solution of making and baking bread.\nOption E: \"Pray for it\": The option acknowledges the problem, but does not address the underlying cause. It is seen as a last resort, rather than a solution.\nConclusion: In conclusion, the correct answer is D: Bake bread.\nSo the final choice will be D: Bake bread\n\nInput: What should you use when there's nothing to write with?

{"text": ": pray D: find a farm E: kill and eat\nOutput: 1: From the question, we can infer that the neolithic person wanted to find a solution to their food problem.\n2. The options provided range from prayer, which involves asking for something without a particular outcome, to hunting which requires physical effort to accomplish.\n3. Looking at the provided options, we can rule out option A: thanking God as it is an act of gratitude and not a solution to the problem at hand.\n4. We can also rule out option B: pray as it is not directly related to finding a realistic solution to the problem.\n5. Options C: hunt for food and D: Find a farm seem relevant as they require effort and planning.  However, option B is ruled out as it does not require immediate action.\n6. Option B is also ruled out as it involves the acquisition of agricultural goods, which has a long lead time that would not be sufficient for the immediate needs of the neolithic people.\n7. Finally, we are left with the option E: kill and eat as it is a solution that requires immediate action and involves taking ownership of the problem.\n8. Although this may be considered morally unethical, when faced with the struggle of not being able to find food, the option of killing and eating would be considered morally permissible.\nSo, the correct answer is E: kill and eat.", "answer": " 70"}
{"text": ": kill an animal D: make a weapon E: pray\nOutput: 1: The question is specifically asking about the neolithic period, focusing primarily on their hunting and gathering ways of subsistence.\n2: Out of the five given options, we can eliminate the first and last options due to being outside of the scope of this question.\n3: It's plausible that the neolithic person would try to find food, based on the context of the question. \n4: A hunter gatherer type culture would naturally have to do what they can to obtain food.\n5: If the neolithic culture practiced hunting and gathering, it stands to reason that they likely had weapons and tools to do so.\n6: However, it stands to reason, given that the neolithics were in the first stage of farming and relied significantly on hunter-gathering that prayer is not a viable option. \n7: Based on the available evidence, the most logical choice would be D.\nSo the final choice is D: Make a weapon\n\nInput: An early form of fire was used by Neanderthals, what did they do with it? Choices: \nA: cooking B: fighting C: roasting D: singing E: all of the above\nOutput: 1) This question is asking about the use of fire by Neanderthals. \n2) From the context, we can see that it's unlikely that Neanderthals would sing with fire.\n3) The options suggest that Neanderthals used fire to cook, fight, or roast, but it's unclear if they used it as part of singing as well. \n4) It's also unclear why the author included the choice \"sing with fire\", it may be a misrepresentation of the options or a typo.\n5) However, this question is more about understanding the context and choices offered. \n6) Given the context and choices provided, it's clear the answer is D: All of the above. \n7) The Neanderthals used their early versions of fire for all the activities stated in the options: Cooking, Fighting, and Roasting. \nSo the final choice would be D: Singing with early fire.\n\n### 1.

{"text": ": kill a cow D: pray for a miracle E: invent farming\nOutput: 1) Context: The answer options provide four possible responses to hunger during the neolithic period, but only two are logical and feasible for someone to carry out on their own.\n2) Option A: 'Thank god' does not accurately reflect what the neolithic person had as a solution, as they did not believe in a god like we do, so would likely not use this expression.\n3) Option B: 'Hunt for food' - This would be a possible response, as hunting was a key lifestyle for many Neolithic people who depended on animal meat for food.\n4) Option C: 'Kill a cow' - This appears possible considering that cows were domesticated during the Neolithic period, and that Neolithic people were known to cultivate their own food by farming and raising animal livestock. However, it would be less likely that an individual person could manage to kill a cow, as cows are large and require equipment to be effectively handled.\n5) Option D: 'Pray for a miracle' - Although it is possible to attribute a miraculous turn of events to divine intervention, during the Neolith ic period, religious practices were not as predominant as they are today.\n6) Option E: 'Invent farming' - This is the only feasible and logical solution for the neolithic people to feed themselves sustainably and fulfill their own hunger. Hunting and gathering were not sufficient to provide enough food for a community of people depending on the same food sources. The rise of agricultural practices marked a pivotal transition in the lifestyle and culture of Neolithic people, enabling them to grow their own food and feed themselves more effectively.\n7) Therefore, based on the logic and reasoning of the context, the answer is E - Invent farming. \nSo the final answer 6: Invent farming\n\n> #### Example of a sentence that uses the \"Inverted Intermediate Pattern to determine if your answer to an exam math problem is correct\n\n### Inverted intermediate pattern\n1) When a question asks us to do something to a group of things, this question's pattern is similar to an exam question where the answer is based on a given", "answer": " 90"}

Option A - \"Thanking God\" - is not a feasible answer.\n2. Option B - \"Hunt for Food\" - is a possible answer, but hunting is not the only solution used by the \"neolithic man\".\n3. Based on the question and the given options, we can infer that the answer would more likely be related to producing food.\n4. Options C- \"Eat\" and D - \"Invent\" - both support the idea of producing or processing food. However, \"Invent\" is too specific and is not a feasible solution for the \"Neolithic Man\".\n5.

New York was a place where goods were available to people who could afford them, not food.\n5: Also, if the Neolithic people moved there, they would never have known what food was, as New York City didn't exist then.\n6: Finally, growing potatoes was not a solution to hunger, but a way to prepare the soil for proper farming.  Farming was invented later. The Neolithic period did not have the technology or knowledge to be able to plant potatoes.\n7: The remaining choices were the correct one.\n\nInput: When people are not well, most of us do what?

The question suggests that the neolithic person's was facing a problem related to food scarcity. To address this, they resorted to collecting nuts to feed themselves. In fact, the word'snare' in the options stands for a trap or device used for hunting, while nuts are seeds from trees and other plants. It is the only suitable option among the choices provided.\n3. The other options are inappropriate as they either fail to address the issue at hand or are incompatible with neolithic culture.\n4. Option A: It makes no logical sense, given that the Neolithic period covered a long span of time and included civilizations that did not believe in God. Moreover, thanksgiving was primarily a function of Native American and Pilgrim cultures and was not a characteristic of Neolithic people.\n5. Option C: It is an unreasonable solution that contradicts the facts presented in the question. Neolithic cultures did not necessarily believe in praying or worshipping a deity.\n6. Option D: It is incompatible with the Neolithic culture, as it involved hunting techniques that were not prevalent during that time. Moreover, the use of \"pray\" in the context of hunting for food contradicts the facts given in the question.\n7.

{"text": ": find some roots D: cook\nOutput: 1.'The neolithic person' refers to a person who lived in the Neolithic period, which was a time in history when people began to use stone tools instead of wood and bone tools. This person's solution to hunger likely stemmed from this new way of living.\n2. Since the neolithic time period was characterized by the use of stone tools and the beginning of farming, it is likely that the person in this question found food through farming.\n3. 'Thank god', 'hunt for food', 'find some roots', and 'cook' do not describe how the neolithic person found food. 'Hunting for food' occurs in the Stone age, therefore cannot be the correct answer, as the person in question lives in the Neolithc period, and farming provides food for the people of that period.\n4. 'Thanking God' would not have been possible in the Neolithi period, as the concept of religion was still thousands of years away. Thus, 'Thank God' cannot be the proper response.\n5. 'finding some roots' could be referring to the early beginnings of agriculture, but does not accurately describe the solution to hunger because the person who is starving is unable to do so.\n6. Therefore, the correct answer is D: cook.\nSo the final answare is D: cook\n\nInput: An author wrote a book, then he wrote another. How many books did he write?

{"text": ": wait for the mall to open D: grow own E: walk into the nearest store\nOutput: 1) The 'Neolithic person' refers to ancient human civilizations - specifically those that used stone tools or implements - that flourished during the Neolithic period, more commonly known as the Stone Age, which spans approximately from 10,000 BC to 3,000 BC.\n2) A 'neolithic person' would face many of the same problems as modern people, including hunger and a need for resources.\n3) Answers A and B refer to modern-day solutions to the problem of hunger, which are outside the context of the neolithic period.\n4) Answer D refers to the practice of homesteading, which would be possible with the development of agriculture later in the neolithic time period. However, this isn't specifically mentioned in the question and focuses on the solution rather than the problem.\n5) Alternate answers C and E refer to behaviors that are inappropriate for a neolithic person, who would likely have relied on foraging and hunting for food.\n6) Based on these factors, answer E doesn't fit.\n7) Answer C doesn't fit either. If a neolithic man wanted to hunt, he would have to leave his settlement, which would require a considerable amount of time. This doesn't solve the immediate problem of hunger.\n8. Answer A is incorrect because the neolithic person should have been hungry despite thanking God. Answer B does not make sense because modern man can hunt for food, but a neolithic hunter would have to spend a lot of time hunting. Finally, answer D is incorrect because a homestead can only produce food when it is a large enough enterprise that someone in a neolithic settlement could work \n9. Answer B's 'walk into the nearest store' is the best answer because a neolithic civilization may have had a market or trading area where they could exchange goods, including food. This answer best solves the problem of hunger by making use of an existing solution.\nSo the final solution is: Walk into the nearest store\n\nInput: A computer can process numbers, text, and what else?

{"text": ": steal food D: grow food E: wait\nOutput: 1) First, we understand the sentence to convey the idea that a Neolithic person was faced with a situation where they were hungry and needed to find food to satisfy their hunger.\n2) From the given options, Option A - 'thank god' seems unlikely to be a solution to hunger since it does not provide the necessary sustenance. Option B - 'hunt for food' may seem plausible, but this option suggests the need for agility and hunting skills which may not be present in a Neolithic population.\n3) Option C -'steal food', although possible, may not be the most desirable solution, and could lead to possible negative consequences.\n4) Option D - 'grow food' appears to be the most plausible solution as this involves acquiring the skills and resources necessary for this process. The choice is further supported by the fact that it is the primary source of sustenance for present day populations. \n5) Option E - 'wait' is not a feasible solution since it would lead to prolonged hunger and, as such, has very little probability of being chosen.\n6) From the above, Option D appears to be the most probable option as it is a feasible solution with minimal resources and skills needed.\n7) Therefore, the given options reduce to a choice between Option D - 'grew food' and Option E - 'wait'.\n8) Since growing food has more favourable outcomes than simply waiting, then Option D would be the correct answer. \n9) Thus, the correct answer is Option D: Grew food.\nSo the final correct answer is Option D : Grew food.\n\nInput: Do these things help plants with photosynthesis?

The individual who is hungry would most likely be attempting to hunt for food to satisfy their hunger.\n4th, the neolithic person would likely need to use a knife to hunt for food, as it was a vital tool to them at that time. This is in contrast to options B and C which do not rely on a knife in any way and may not be relevant to the problem of being hungry. \n5th, the individual may have prayed for food, but as a neolithic person (which means they were a hunter-gather style culture), a knife is most likely an important tool to them. Therefore, \"use a knife\" is the most relevant and suitable answer to the problem of being huntergatherer\nSo, the final answer is E : use a knife\n\nInput: The number of hours we work is a matter of choice in this country.

The question provides some limited information about the neolithic period specifically the existence of the neolithic man, which is one of the earliest civilizations.\n3. From this information, we can construct the most suitable answer.\n4. Since the neolithic era is the time leading to the civilized society, this period is typically described more of primitive.\n5. Option E : hedgehog is not correct the reason is because hedgehog is a creature that people eat in modern days which is wrong on the period.\n6.

{"text": ": grow the food  D: gather food  E: cook the food\nOutput: 1: First, we need to analyze the context of the question. It's about a Neolithic person who is hungry and seeking a solution to the problem.\n2. To understand the types of choices available to the Neolithic person, there must be an understanding of food preparation methods that were prevalent during the Neolithic Age.\n3. During this period, there was no written language, so methods of food preparation relied on oral traditions and techniques passed down through generations.\n4. The Neolithic person is likely to have had a limited range of options for preparing food, as the tools, ingredients, and techniques available to them would have been basic compared to modern methods.\n5. Looking at the options given, it's clear from the context that they're the different stages and methods involved in the process of growing and preparing food.\n6. From the options, it's clear option B 'grow' fits the context the best. It's a necessary part of any food preparation technique where the food needs to be grown or cultivated before it can be cooked.\n7. Since the Neolithic era, this process has evolved and become more advanced with new techniques being developed.\n8. Therefore, the answer to the question is B: Grow.\nSo the final answers is B: Grow\n\nInput: If a person is very happy to buy something new, what will he/she probably be?

The answer is likely to be a solution to a problem faced back then.\n3rd. When we look at the given options, we see that choice B (hunting for food) is the most logical answer, as it is the one that most closely aligns with the needs of a person in prehistoric times.\n4th. The other options (praying, building, and sharing it) can be considered, but they are not as directly relevant to the problem of hunger.\n5th. Choice A (thanking God) is a possibility, however, it is not clear what that entails exactly.\n6th. Choice C (praying) is a choice that can be considered, but it's not related to the specific need for food, which emphasises that the option B (hunting) is the most logical solution for the neolithic person who was hungry.\nSo the final Answer is B: Hunting for food\n\nInput: What is a way to make an old car smell nicer? Choices:  (Windshield wash and wipe, Windex, Air freshener, Sponge with soapy water, Air freshener)\nOutput: In the given information we can understand that the old car that is 'sounds like' is a car that might not have enough air fresheners or not have enough water or soap for the old cars.\nIn this case, the best way to make an old vehicle smell better is to use a windshield wash and then wipe it off with the dry side of a microfiber cloth. This will help to remove dirt and debris that can cause the car to smell bad.  We can also add air freshener and sponge it with soap and water. This will help to make the car smell much, cleaner.\n\nIn summary, this article is helpful to those who are looking for the instruction of the Math Questions that are given on the GED test. \n\n## Credits:\n- \uc5b8\ud1a1\ub180 : https://talk.leadereducation.com/e/leaderedu-2", "answer": " 200"}
{"text": ": pray for food D: grow some food E: invent the wheel\nOutput: 1.] First, we need to examine the question in more detail, which is related to the Neolithic people and their solution to a problem.\n2. The question refers to a person who was \"hungry\", which could be interpreted as referring to a particular individual or a representative of the entire Neolithic population.\n3. Hungry could be interpreted as a need for food, suggesting that the Neolithic population was experiencing a food shortage or food scarcity.\n4. Based on this context, it's important to consider the options provided.\n5. Option \"A: Thank God\" is not relevant to a solution to a food problem.\n6. Option \"B: Hunt for Food\" aligns to the idea of hunting as a method of obtaining food that was practiced by the Neolithic peoples. It could be assumed that if the population experienced a food shortage, they would engage in hunting as a way to obtain food.\n7. Option \"C: Pray for Food\" is ambiguous and could indicate praying for a solution to the food shortage or praying for aid in obtaining food. It's unclear if this form of prayer would have been used by the Neolithics or how effective it would have been.\n8. Option \"D: Grow some food\" is relevant to the context and could have been utilized to address the food shortage by growing food as a means of obtaining food.\n9. Option \"E: Invent the Wheel\" is not relevant to the Neolithics and their food shortage.\n10. The most likely option is D: Grow some food, given the context of the question and the absence of options C and D.\nSo the final option is D: GROW SOME FOOD\n\nInput: The teacher said, \u2018A: you are too young to drive.\u201d  The class listened to your answer?

{"text": ": trade with the neighbours D: build a shelter E: grow your own food\nOutput: 1) The problem the neolithic person faced was 'hunger'.\n2. There were various ways to tackle the issue of hunger as indicated by the options given:\n3. The only way one can 'thank god' for 'answering' the hunger problem is if he or she believes in a higher power and is thankful for him or her. It is unlikely that someone in the neolithic age would believe in a higher power, so this cannot be the correct option.\n4. Similarly, the option to 'build a shelter' seems logical, but a neolithic person would not have had the tools or the materials to build a shelter in a way that it could adequately protect against hunger. Hunting for food could also be the possible solution, but the option is unclear what sort of hunting would occur and for what purpose; The option of trading with the neighbours does not specifically mention 'trading for food', so 'grow your own food' is the only logical option in this case.\nSo the final option should be E: grow your own fruit.\nSo the final response would be E: grow your food.", "answer": " 2"}
{"text": ": find an old cave D: go fishing E: gather sticks\nOutput: 1.\"The neolithic person\" is specifically referring to people who lived during the stone age.\n2.\"Hungry\" suggests that food was scarce or in short supply, which leads to looking for other options.\n3. \"Find an old cave\" does not fit the context, as a solution to scavenging for food during the stone age would most likely not be a cave.\n4. \"Go fishing\" is relevant, but requires the possession of tools and a body of water, both of which are unlikely conditions that may have existed during the time period in question.\n5. \"Gathering sticks\" does not fit the narrative of the question, as it seems more like an attempt to create a fire rather than a solution to acquiring food.\n6. \"Thank God\" does not seem like a practical or logical solution in this context and is not a likely response.\n7. Based on these considerations, the answer is E:\"Gather sticks\".\nSo the final answers is E: gather sticks \n\n\n## Instructions:Answer the following math question.\n\n## Input: John only gave a ______ examination of the corpe, though he did everything rquired of him.

{"text": ": gather D: hunt and gather E: build a fence\nOutput: 1. First observe, In context, \"The Neolithic person had a problem of being hungry.\" this is not a problem of the neolithic people but a problem of one Neolithic person.\n2. Option a \u2013 \"Thank God\" is a direct and specific response to a problem. It's unlikely the Neolithic person would say such a thing, as hunter-gatherers from this time period typically wouldn't believe in or rely on a higher being.\n3. Option b - \"Hunt for food\" seems like the most logical solution in this context, as it directly involves hunting animals and gathering food as a response to the problem of being hungry. Additionally, this is the type of behavior characteristic of hunter-gatherer societies, which would have been widespread in the Neolithic era.\n4. Option c - \"Gather food\" is also an option, as hunter- and gatherers would also regularly gather wild fruits, vegetables, or other food sources.\n5. \"Build a fence\" could also be an option to deal with the problem of being hungr, but it would be a bit of a stretch in context as the Neolithic Era was characterized by the advent of agriculture.\n6. Option e- \"Thank God\" is an unlikely response to a problem that would be associated with hunter-gathering societies.\n7. Thus, the most likely solution is \"B: hunt for food\".\n8. However, \"hunt and gather\" is an option that has both \"hunt\" and \"gather\" as actions associated with dealing with the problem of being hanger.\n9. Although option a- \"Thank God\" doesn't exactly require hunt and gather, it also does not require hunt or gather.\n10.

{"text": ": make their own food D: beg for food E: kill for food\nOutput: 1- The question asks about what solution a Neolithic person would have made to solve the issue of food availability.\n2. The Neolithic era is marked by the advent of agriculture, which led to the production of food.\n3. So, the Neolithic person is likely to be concerned about agriculture rather than hunting or fishing for food.\n4. Therefore, it is clear that the best possible solution to the food scarcity problem was agricultural production during the Neolithic era.\n5. The given options are options (A) (hunting) & (B) (hunting), which aren't necessarily the best solution to the problem.\n6. Option (C) (making own food) can be a possible solution, but it doesn'g neccesarily mean that it is the best one.\n7. Option (D) (begging for food) is not applicable to the period of Neolithic agriculture.\n8. The only option that matches the Neolithic period is option (E) (killing for food).\n9. So, the answer is E, they had to kill for food.\nSo the final correct answer is E: kill for food.\n\nInput: What was the cause of the famous American Revolutionary soldier, Ethan Allen's death?

Option A: thank god - this does not address the problem of food scarcity; It is also ambiguous in nature, as one cannot know whether the person actually does pray to god or if they even believe in god.\n4. Option B: Hunt for food - this is a solution which addresses the issue of food scarcity and directly relates to the Neolithic lifestyle, which involved hunting and gathering.\n5. Option C: grow vegetables - While this is a possible solution, it is not a specific solution that the person would have followed.\n6. Option D: Cook food - This is a solution which addresses food scarcity and is a plausible solution for the neolithic person, as it fits with their lifestyle and way of hunting and gathering food.\n7.

{"text": ": hope for rain D: make a fire E: pray\nOutput: 1) The context of the question indicates that a Neolithic person is struggling with hunger and is seeking a solution. So, let's analyze the options in the light of food production.\n2) Option A seems to suggest that a Neolithc person could be starving due to lack of food, or due to lack of understanding as to why they don\u2019t have the resources to produce food. As this is the only option which does not mention production, it can be rejected.\n3) Option B hints at a possible hunting activity to procure food. An activity such as hunting wouldn\u2019t have yielded much if any food in most situations, as a single successful hunt wouldn\u2019t have been enough to feed a large group or even a single person. \n4) Option C suggests that the Neolithic person could be seeking hope, or praying for rain which could lead to a possibility of having better food resources. The rain might not have been the solution that would have been required to provide food for the Neolithic people, but it could have helped solve the food crisis in the meantime, when there was no other way to produce food. \n5) Option D refers to a potential activity like lighting a fire, which could be used for cooking and preserving food. It could be the only solution to the problem, as the act would have provided a way to extract food from food sources, which would have helped feed the people. \n6) Option E refers to making prayer, which although could have increased the hope and expectation, but it is too vague to be the only option as it could mean anything and does not provide a clear answer on how it could have increased the probability of acquiring food resources. \n7) Thus we can conclude that the option E: \u201cpray\u201d is the best option, as the act of praying was a way that could have been utilized to increase the hope and expectation, and with hope and expectation, the actual activity of \u201cmaking fire\u201d would have turned out to be successful.\n8) Therefore, the answer is B: hope for rain.\nSo the final answers is B: hope for  rain.\n\nInput: I don\u2019t understand it.

{"text": ": pray D: build a fire E: find a fire\nOutput: 1 The question asks about the early humans and their behavior when they were hungry\n2. Option A states:  'thank God' but this option doesn't really match the scenario of food scarcity.\n3. Option C states 'pray' which does match the given scenario, but is an unrealistic statement to make, or an assumption to formulate.\n4. Option B states 'hunt for food' which is a common solution to food scarcity and matches with the scenario.\n5. Option E states 'build a fire' which has a lot of potential utility as well but building a fire is something that can't be done immediately. \n6. Therefore, the correct answer must be B: hunt for a food.\nSo the final option is B: hunt for some food.\n\nInput: Who was more surprised by the sight of the new-born, the dad or the mom? Choices: 1) A: the dad alone B: the dad and mom C: the mom alone D: the mom and dad E: nobody since everybody already knew that it was going to be a girl since it was their second girl\nOutput: The question is about a couple who have their second child, a girl. We already know that from the context. The question is who was more surprised at seeing the new born among the duo.\n1. The dad - He was certainly more surprised since the second child is a girl. He is left to guess who the child is.\n2. The mom - She was not as surprised as the dad because she would have known it was going to be another girl.\n3. Both dad and mom - They are both equally surprised to see another girl after their first girl.\n4. Nobody Since the couple already knew that it was to be another girl. No further surprise can happen.\n5. The correct answer is E for nobody was surprised since they already knew that it was a second girl.\n\nNote: It is a common pattern in such questions to see 'Both dad and mom' or 'Nobody.. since XYZ' option.

They are unable to thank god or pray on their own, as they were unaware of the concept of a supreme being who they can worship etc.\n3) Options B and E are possible, however they are not necessarily a solution to the problem.\n4) Option A is possible. The neolithic individual could appreciate the help received.\n5) Option B is possible as they could have been in the process of hunting and not necessarily found food in the end.\n6) Option C is possible. They may have been thankful for the food they had found through hunting.\n7) Option D is possible. The person could have cooked the food they had hunted. They may of course be unfamiliar with the concepts of cooking or may not have been confident in doing so.\n8) Option C is possible as they may have prayed for divine intervention to help them find and hunt for food.\n9) Option D is possible as they may of learned to create fire to help them cook food they have found and the fire could've been used to keep animals from fleeing away.\n10) Option E is possible as they may've been able to invent the first tools which could help them hunt prey and/or create fire.\n11) Therefore, the most suitable answer is option D: cook\nSo the final answer should be D: cook\n\nInput: Sam had a good time at the party,  He felt really what?

{"text": ": fish D: gather nuts E: pray\nOutput: 1) We can understand the main ideas of the question by noting that the neolithic people were the ones who solved the food problem, and that they had to hunt for food.\n2) \"Thank God\" is an expression of gratitude, but it is not a solution to a problem.\n3) \"Hunt for food\" is a more suitable expression of the problem-solving approach of the neolithic person.\n4) \"Fish\" could be a possible solution to the food problem, but it is unlikely that would be the sole solution.\n5) \"Gather nuts\" does not necessarily solve the food problem, and may be a byproduct of hunting for food.\n6) \"Pray\" does not solve a problem, but rather expresses a desire for divine intervention.\n7) \"Gather nests\" is an inaccurate and unrelated expression in regards to the neolithic era.\n8) Therefore, the answer is \"c) fish\": since the neolithic was faced with a problem of having insufficient sustenance through hunting, they hunted for food, and fish was likely one of the food sources they captured to satisfy their hunger.\nSo the final answers is C: fish\n\nInput: Who do you take advice from most?

{"text": ": kill for food D: find a way to grow food E: go to the shop\nOutput: 1. From 1000 BC up until 1000 AD the pre agricultural and agricultural eras existed. During this time period, which was roughly 2000 years, people lived a nomadic lifestyle and did not use the advanced methods of farming that they use today.\n2. The question provides a specific context within this time period - the neolithic era. During this era,  hunt for food and kill for food were the primary sources of food as a majority of people did not possess the necessary tools, skills or knowledge to successfully grow their own food.\n3. During the neolithic times agriculture was not used to grow foods and hunting was not an option at this time as hunter-gatherers had learned. This meant that a majority of the population had no other option but to resort to methods of obtaining food other than through hunting or agriculture.\n4. Therefore, for that particular 2000 year span of time, the neolithic answer would likely be C) kill for food.\nSo the final Answer is C: kill for food\n\nInput: She's lost her sense of smell; what might she be experiencing?

{"text": ": eat rocks D: eat what was in caves E: eat from the ground\nOutput: 1.'Neolithic' means people that were associated with the 'new stone age' or 'new age of farming and food'. This period, which took place long ago, lasted from about 10,000-5000 BCE. During that time, people ate food that was not readily available in today's society.\n2. They did not rely on refrigeration and had no such device to store food. They were hungry and had to find ways to obtain food.\n3. They did not generally farm and were mostly nomadic and hunter-gatherers; hence food needed to be hunted.\n4. They did not usually live in houses but in caves and tents and foraging nearby.\n5. These primitive people lived without technology which we use today. They also did not have refrigeration and did not have the knowledge to keep food edible for long.\n6. Based on the explanation, we can understand their solution to the problem: \"Hunt for food.\" \n7. Looking for food is also known as 'foraging.' Hunting is done to gather food, whether meat or vegetables.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be D: Hunt for food.\nSo the final answear\n is D: Hunt for Food\n\nInput: The book is long, the answer is one, what does 'one' mean?

The neolith period was characterized by the development of agriculture and domestication of animals, but these changes did not occur until later in history. So, the option A: 'thank god' is not applicable.\n4. The time of the development of the agricultural methods for food production and animal husbandry was in the neolithic period as well. The option of option B: 'hunt for food' is therefore applicable.\n5. The options C and D: 'gather wood' & 'gather food' could also be considered applicable, but it can be considered that the option B: 'hunter for food' is the most suitable for the context.\nSo the final option is B: hunt for foood\n\nInput: If a plant is very fanciful it's grown specifically for its flowers and what does it have?

A plant with very fancy flowers can be grown for its aesthetic appeal, which is why it's referred to as having \"fancy flowers\".\n2. A plant that has fancy flowers can also be grown without roots or a trunk since it's grown specifically to have fancy flowers.\n3. If the answer to the main question is already a plant that has roots or a trunk, then there may be confusion around whether it also has fancy flowers.\n4. The answer may be A bush, but then it's unclear if it has fancy flowers or not. If it has fancy flowers, then it is likely that the answer is still a bush plant.\n5. The answer could be C.

If the plant has fancy flowers, it's likely that the answer still remains a bush plant or a tall truck.\n6", "answer": " 32"}
{"text": ": pray for food D: pray for good harvest E: sacrifice to gods\nOutput: 1) The question provides information about the Neolithic person and their situation. They were hungry, so they needed food urgently.\n2) They didn't have access to industrialized agriculture, so hunting and food gathering were the only options available to them.\n3) These options are also reflected in the choice, \"Hunt for food\".\n4) This can narrow down the choices to two options: B & C.\n5) As both \"Pray for food\" and \"Pray for good harvest\" have similar meanings of seeking help or intervention from higher powers.\n6) However, \"Hunt for Food\" is a more specific action or deed, which can point to the Neolithic's solution to their problem.\n7) \"Thank God\" is unlikely to be a viable option for a hungry Neolithic person, as they are likely to be unsure of a higher being or power.\n8) Similarly, \"God\" might not be a concept they are familiar with.\n9) Hence, using \"Hunt for Food \" as the solution for their problem is the most logical answer.\n10) \"Hunt for Food\", as a term, is specific to the Neolith's actions and the context of their problem, \"hungry\", while \"Pray for food,\" or any option not related to hunting, would feel too vague in their context.\n11) Therefore, the most logical answer is B: hunt for Food.\nSo the final Answer is B: Hunting for food\n\nInput: She tried to find food but there was only a muffin left.

So, interpretation number 1 is not a valid choice as option E, and doesn't fit the time and place, so it can be ignored.\n6) Option B \"hunt for food\" is a viable option in a context where hunting and gathering are the main means of acquiring food.\n7) Options C, D, and E are forms of fire-making, which were a crucial element in the process of hunting and gathering and could have been used to solve the problem of food insecurity.\n8) Option D \"farm\" is not a viable solution at this point in time, as the advent of farming only occurred much later, during the Neolithic period.\n9) Therefore, from the provided choices, the answer is C D: farm.\nSo the final answers is C D: farm\n\nInput: She was a good person.

{"text": ": go to the store D: go back to sleep E: start up a fire\nOutput: 1 - The first clue is that the person was hungry. This implies that food is scarce.\n2 - Since food is in short supply, there is not enough for everyone in this society and people must hunt for it.\n3 - The neolithic period was a time when hunting was an important source of food.\n4 - Due to this scarcity, people must take care when hunting for food, or else they may starve.\n5 - Hunting for food would have been more difficult during the neolithic period due to a lack of technology.\n6 - So it makes sense that people would have to go back to bed because finding food would have been very difficult.\n7 - Therefore, the answer is A: thank god.\nSo the final answers are A: thank god", "answer": " 8"}

The question provided us with the context of how the person was hungry, and therefore used the term 'food.' \nInput: Everybody knows the truth of who Jesus was, it's a matter of what? Choices A: faith B: fact C: proof D: knowledge E: religion\nOutput: 1) Answer: The question asks us to infer the correct word or phrase that summarizes the concept of \"the truth of who Jesus was.\" \n2) Examining the chosen options, we can discard those that would not make sense to use, such as \"fact\" or \"proof.\" \n3) Therefore, we can only consider words that express beliefs or knowledge about a person - \"faith,\" \"knowledge\" and \"religion.\"\n4) \"Faith\" and \"religious\" would both suggest that the person believed in Jesus and followed a belief system. \n5) \"Knowledge\" could imply that the person was familiar or knowledgeable of Jesus' life. \n6) However, the original phrase \"knew the truth of who Jesus is.\" implies greater certainty, such that it implies certainty to one's knowledge. \n7) The best phrase that summarizes the chosen options is, therefore, \"knowledge\" as it is more concise and implies greater certainty.\n### Summary 2:\nInput: I'll get offline at once!

The given options seem to be related to a general problem-solving approach, such as asking for help or finding alternatives.\n2.) Looking at the given options, the best option could be \"E\": prayer for food and rain, as it implies a belief in a higher power and is associated with the neolithic period, where religion and spirituality are notably prevalent.\n3.) In addition, the idea of having 'thank god' followed by a solution or action, such as 'hunting for food' or 'pray for food', would not fit with the context of the neolithic era, as they did not believe in the concept of one deity.\n4.) While 'A' and 'B' may be solutions for current times, they are not necessarily options that the neolithic person would have chosen in the past.\n5.) Finally, 'D' would not be a logical choice for the neolithic people, as the concept of praying to multiple entities or deities is unique to later eras.\n\nSo the final answer would be E: Pray for food and rain\n\nInput: How can you prepare for an essay exam?

{"text": ": be innovative D: create a wheel E: move to the countryside\nOutput: 1) The question's context reveals that it is likely referring to the hunting and gathering times in human history.\n2. The options can be interpreted as a lack of innovative thinking, as options A: thank god and C: be innovative are not possible solutions.\n3. The option D: create a wheel could be interpreted as 'creating innovative technology', however the question doesn't elaborate on this.\n4. Option D can also be interpreted to'moving to a more populated area to hunt and gather' which seems to be the most logical contextual interpretation.\n5. Finally, the last option, the neolithic person'moved to the countrys', which is the correct answer as it makes the most sense out of the options given.\n6. So, we can conclude that the answer is E: move to the country side\nSo the final answeris E: move to the countyside\n\nInput: A farmer uses which form of farming the most. Choices:  A; monocropping B: hobby c: sustainable D: irrigation E: ecological\nOutput: 1). The options chosen are all related to aspects of farming and/or land.\n2. Option C: hobby is something that is done as a pastime of recreation which could not be related to farming.\n3. Option D: Irrigation is something that is done specifically for farming purposes and could be considered a sub-category of a particular kind of farming.\n4. Option A and B can both be considered forms of farming, but they do not give us any useful insights into the farmer's practices.\n5. Finally option E: ecological is the form of farming that the farmer chooses to use to support their farming.\n6.

Choices: 1: The world\u2019s biggest island 2: The world\u2019s smallest republic 3: The world\u2019s most remote country 4: A tropical climate 5: A dry climate in the winter\nOutput: Firstly we understand that the question does not contain a \"What is..?\" structure. Therefore we cannot expect the answer choice to be a description of a thing or object itself.\nSecondly, the options given to us, are a mixture of statements true and false.\nThis is not a case of \"True or False\" or \"Multiple Choices\" questions.\nThis is a case of \"List of statements, 4 of which are statements that are true; the rest is false\", or \"A set of objects/concepts, 4 of which have been selected from the collection.\"\nThirdly, we can rule out 1,2 and 3 as we are not provided with any information about whether the island is large or small. We are only provided with information that it is Bermuda, and we are being asked to choose why this is the case. As an additional factor, we can rule out the option \"The world\u2019s most remote city\" as it is the fourth one, in which the context provided is \"winter\", indicating seasons of the winter. \nOption 4 can be ruled out as winter does not explain, in any context, why Bermuda has a tropical climate or if it does not have it.\nOption 5 is a correct answer. This answers the question whether Bermuda is dry in the winter.\nTherefore, the full answer would be 5: A dry climat\nSo the answer is 5\n\nInput: What is the capital of the Republic of Ireland?", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": ": cook for themselves E: wait for agriculture\nOutput: 1) The context of the question implies that The neolithic people are hunter-gathers, and thus their food intake is dependent on hunting and gathering food.\n2) However, they are faced with the problem of being hungry, indicating that they either ran out of food or could not find any.\n3) As hunting and gathering can be time-consuming, the neolithic people have a problem of not having food readily available.\n4)  The statement \"so their solution was...\" implies that hunting and gathering food is not a viable option.\n5) From the options, 'Hunt for food' seems plausible but it still involves the time-consuming process of hunting and gathering food, which is inefficient in the current context.\n6) The process of cooking food could also involve gathering ingredients and preparing meals,  making it a viable option. \n7) The statement \"wait for agriculture\", which refers to using land for agricultural purposes, isn't feasible as it contradicts the hunting and gathering lifestyle and requires time and resources,  which again doesn't seem to be a potential solution.\n8) Looking at the other possibilities, \"cook for themsevles\" seems to be the most logical choice as it involves taking initiative, planning meals, and preparing food, which would be a more effective solution than the hunting and gathering process. \n9) Additionally, cooking for oneself is a more efficient and effective way of obtaining food without relying on hunting and gathering, thereby solving the issue of being hungry.\n10) Based on the reasoning, the most likely solution to the problem of being hungr is to 'cook for themsevlies.'\n11)  Therefore, the correct answer is B: cook for themselves.\nSo the final answers is B: Cook for Themselves\n\nInput: A large and powerful animal has died a certain way.

{"text": ": take a break D: invented bread E: discover wild grains\nOutput: 1)The question deals with a hypothetical scenario where a Neolithic person is hungry and seeking a solution to their hunger.\n2. Option B 'Hunt for food' doesn't seem to be a logical choice as hunting could potentially be more time consuming than creating bread. \n3. Option D 'invented bread' does not directly imply that they were seeking a solution to their situation of being hungry, as it could have just been the start of their bread making journey.\n4. Option E 'discovered wild grains' can be linked to how they came up with bread, but it's not necessarily a direct solution to their hunger problem. 5. We can, therefore, eliminate choices A, B, and D from the question, leaving us with options C and E.\n6. Option A 'thanked god' doesn't seem probable as a solution to their hung\n7. Problem, as it isn't a direct action that would lead to satis\n8. faction and it's not something that a Neolithic individual would\n9. likely think of as part of seeking a solution to their hungry.\n10. Thus, the answer is Option D 'inventing bread'\nSo the final answer to: What was the Neolithic person's solution to the problem of being hungry? is E: discovering wild grains.\n\nInput: A child who has ADHD should be able to what?

{"text": ": grow veggies D: gather eggs E: grow plants\nOutput: 1)First, the word \"neolithic\" in the question implies a transition from a hunting and gathering lifestyle to agriculture and settlement.\n2)Further, the use of the word \"was\" indicates past tense, which indicates that the person was already hungry.\n3)Taking this into account, we can deduce the answer from the options given.\n4)Option A \"thank god\" is not applicable as \"thank god\" has a religious connotation that cannot be applied to a neolithic period.\n5)Option B \"hunt for food\" indicates that the \"person\" is talking about hunting, which is not a common practice in the Neolithic period. \n6)Option C \"grow veggies\" is not possible, as it can be inferred from the context that Neolithic people were hunters and gatherers.\n7)Option D \"gather eggs\" is also not likely as it would not solve the problem of being hungry if gathering eggs was the solution.\n8)So, the answer can be either option A or E: grow plants which means to cultivate plants.\nSo the final solution is either E: grow plants and A: grow plants.\n\nInput: There are two main kinds of fishes. One is a bottom feeder, the other is a fish that does what? Choices: Eat A: fly B: float C: swim D: hunt\nOutput: 1: First, we must understand the question. It states that there are two types of fish: one is a bottom feeder and the other is a type of fish that does what?.\n2. It can be inferred from this sentence that the second type of fish is not exclusively a feeder, as the term \"fish\" is typically used to define multiple types of animals.\n3. The question also asks what the other type of fish is, which makes it clear that they are not just feeders, but also perform other activities.\n4. Since there are two types of non-bottom feeders available, it's clear they do two primary things (fishing), not just one.\n5. Looking at the options: eating fly is unusual but possible for fish, fishing float is possible but also unlikely (since fish tend", "answer": " 20"}

The options provided to solve the problem are all related to agriculture, which suggests that they didn't have access to traditional food sources like hunting or foraging.\n3. If the person is still around in the traditional period, then option E can't be a correct answer as the term \"create their own food\" means that the people were resourceful and that options A, B and C aren't correct answers.\n4. Option D means \"farm it\" but is not a specific term. So we can eliminate Option B and Option D.\n5. Option C \"hunting for food\" seems to be specific to wildlife and has nothing specific to \"neolithic\" time period.\n6. Option A \"thank god for food\" is irrelevant in a technical sense, and does not indicate a specific method for acquiring food.\n7. Finally, option E \"create their own food\", is the most specific solution that the person could take to acquire food.\n8. Therefore, the answer should be the option E: create their own by farming it.\nSo the final answers are E: create their own, by farming it.  \n\nInput: People have many different names, such as John Walker.

They would have needed to find ways to \"gather\" food because that was what was readily available at the time.\n5. Option E: grow food is likely not applicable as Neolithic people were not farmers or cultivators.\n6. Option A: \"thanks god\" is an expression indicating gratitude and not necessarily a solution, however the meaning of the question is asking for a concrete action step to address the problem.\n7. Option B \"hunt food\" is plausible, however, given that food would have been hard to come by, hunting food probably wouldn't be effective. The \"deer population wasn't nearly as big as they are today\"\n8. Option C \"fish food\" while not wrong, doesn't necessarily encompass all food sources available in the Neolithic period, such as gathering fruits and other produce.\n9. Option D: \"gather food\" is the most plausible answer because it is a concrete action step and encompasses other food options besides just fishing.\n10.

The man may decide to consume the waffle alone, as options A and B are the only other choices mentioned.\n3) Option E suggests using the jam as a topping, which could be used in conjunction with the waffle.\n4.) There is also an implicit indication of the waffle itself as the only possible consumption option, as the first word of the sentence is \"The waffle was the\u2026\"\n5.)

Animals would be able to help the neolithic people hunt for food but may not solve the hunger problem.\n4. Since the neolithic individual has other options such as gathering berries, fish and so on, this solution cannot be the answer.\n5. Hence the option D can be ruled out. \n6) Gathering berries, fish, and so on provide food to the neolithic man but do not aid in their solution to the hunger issue.\n7) Hence, the correct option can be C: to find another animal.\nSo the final question is C: find another plant.\n\nInput: A book written in a 17th Century English dialect may be what?

{"text": ": plant D: search for wild animals E: pick up food\nOutput: 1.'' The question talks about the neolithic era, when people had to rely on hunting and gathering for their food. \n2. Given that they were hungry, our first approach is to look at the options.\n3. Option A 'Thank God' is the only option that does not seem to directly relate to solving the hunger problem.\n4. Option B 'Hunt for food' seems like a logical option, as hunting animals was one of the ways the Neolithic people procured food.\n5. Option C 'Plant' could be another option, but the other option makes sense as well, therefore, this is a tie-breaker one.\n6. Option D 'Search for wild animals' could be another option for the hungry Neolithic people, especially after going through the hunt for food.\n7. Option 'Pick up food' could have meant scavenging for food, which could have potentially been another solution for the hungry Neolitcl person.\n8. So the options that can be considered are: Hunt and plant.  Based on how the question has been set up (the context and available choices) it could be inferred that the answer to the question is the option C.\nSo the final option is C: Plants\n\nInput:  The world is always changing, and for some people, it gets pretty unpleasant.

{"text": ": plant D: build shelter E: create shelter\nOutput: 1: \"the neolithic person\" was a generic term used to refer to hunter-gatherers or nomadic tribes.\n2. \"was\" implies the person acted in a particular manner for a result to occur.\n3. Looking at the given options: thank god, hunt for food, plant, build shelter, create shelter, we can determine which of them were used as solutions by the people mentioned in the question.\n4. \"Thank god\" is an expression of gratitude, not a solution to a problem; \"Hunt for food\" is an action taken to acquire food, not a solution to food shortage; \"Plant\" means sowing seeds, not creating a shelter; \"Build shelter\" is an action taken for shelter, not necessarily a solution to food problem; So, \"create shelter\", the action of creating a shelter, could be used as a solution to food problems.\n5. Therefore the correct answer is E: create shelter\nSo the final answer E: create shelter", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": ": dig some roots D: fish E: find some fruit\nOutput: 1) The neolithic period (4100 BC \u2013 2000 BC) refers to an era in human history when people began to settle down in permanent dwellings and grow their own crops. This way of life marked a significant transition from the hunter-gatherer lifestyle of the Paleolithic era (14,000 BC \u2013 4100 BC) and resulted in the development of new tools such as the wheel, pottery, and art. \n2) The question suggests that Neolithic people faced a problem of scarcity, likely due to a lack of resources in the area.\n3) Based on the context, the best option is D: fish, as fishing was a common method of obtaining food during this period.\n4) Digging for roots, hunting for food, finding fruit and thanking God were also practices, but would not have likely solved the issue of lack of resources faced by the Neolithic people.\n5) By finding the correct answer among the given options, we can gain a deeper understanding of the context and the specific nature of the solution presented in the question.\nSo the final answers is D: Fish", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": ": hunt animals D: take a nap E: go to the grocery\nOutput: 1, The question revolves around a neolithic person being hungry, so we should identify why they are experiencing hunger.\n2. Based on the given information- that they are \"neolithic,\" they are probably not aware of a system that can provide them with food by shopping.\n3, The context suggests that the person could be experiencing hunger because they do not have any food or not enough food, which leads us to the next step.\n4, Looking at the options, it is unlikely that they can find enough food to satisfy their hunger by finding animals.\n5. The context suggests that their solution should revolve around food, which is related to the choice D: take a nap.\n6. This is unlikely as it says they are \"neolthic\" and their focus is on getting food.\n7. The solution that is most likely to resolve the hunger of a neolithic man is the choice C: hunt for food.\n8. This choice can be inferred from their occupation as hunters, their need for food, and the fact that taking a nap would be a short-term solution to satisfy hunger.\n9. Therefore according to the problem/question, the correct answer is option C: hunt for animals\nSo the final answeris C: hunt for animal\n\nInput: What is a common thing people would be able to say about the story of Joseph?

{"text": ": farm D: pick up E: forage\nOutput: 1) The question poses a hypothetical scenario and asks for the solution that a neolithic person who was \"hungry\" would have sought.\n2) The hypothetical scenario suggests that the neolithic period covered the period between 10,000 BC to 2,000 BC. It was a time when people transitioned from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to an agrarian lifestyle.\n3) The question hints at the solution the person would have sought to \"solve their hunger\" problem, rather than a solution that would have been ideal, making it important to consider the context.\n4) Looking at the given options and their relevance: Option A: \"Thank god\" may be used as an expression of gratitude or relief, however, it doesn't provide a solution to the problem and is not relevant to the context.\n5) Option B: \"Hunt for food\" may have been the solution sought previously, however, the question states that a \"neolithic person\" was \"hungry.\" Option B is not relevant to the neolithic context and is likely to be ruled out.\n6) Option C: \"Farm\" refers to the farming practices adopted by the neolithic people and is relevant to the context; it suggests that farming may have been an option sought to \"solve the hunger' problem.\n7) Option D: \"Pick up\" may refer to picking and gathering food items, however, it doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate what they picked up or why they would have picked them up; therefore, it is unlikely to be relevant.\n8) Option E: \"Forage\" refers to the gathering of wild food items and is relevant to the question as it implies that gathering was likely to be an option searched for to alleviate hunger.\n9) Therefore, based on the context, \"forage\" is the most likely solution that a \"neolthic person\" would have sought. The word \"foraged\" would provide context, as it refers to the process of gathering wild food. Since the neolithic era was characterized by the introduction of farming, the word \"farmed\", would also be valid.\n10) Therefore, the answer is either D: Farmed", "answer": " 165"}

The neolithic era is a time period in human history (4000 BC-2000 BC) during which many technological advances were made, including the invention and use of fire.\n2) Thus, it's likely that Neolithic people were using fire for cooking their food.\n3) The questions indicates that the Neolithic person was \"hungry\", which suggests that they might not have cooked their food beforehand. There may have been scarcity of food or difficulties with hunting, etc.\n4) So, the options offered are\nA) \"Thanking god\" doesn't necessarily solve the problem of being hungry, which is a physical need.\nB) \"Hunting for food\" could have been done beforehand. The problem of being hungry might have been solved by the availability of food in the first place.\nC) \"Making fire\" was an important invention that helped in cooking food. It doesn't necessarily solve being hungry due to scarcity.\nD) \"Cooking food\" itself would have been the solution to being hungry. Although it could have been done by hunting for food or making a fire, the question asks about the solution to being hungr. Thus, cooking food would be the correct answer. \n5) Therefore, the answer would be D: Cook their food.  So the final answer is D.\n\nInput: Where did they get all their material for the pyramid?

They had a solution to their problem, which we're trying to figure out.\n2) Looking at the options:\nBased on the description of Neolithic people, they might not be overly religious and may not have frequent access to supermarkets. So, they probably had very little access to ready-to-eat food that could easily be purchased at stores.\n3) Option A: \"thank god\" is not very practical - as Neolithic people often didn't believe in the God concept.\n4) Option B: \"hunt for food\" is probably not feasible for every situation and could be risky and challenging.\n5) Option C: \"Wait till tomorrow\" might not be a convenient solution, given the time and resources available to the Neolithic person. It could also prove to be risky, as they may become too hungry to find food later on.\n6) Option D: \"Take food from others\" might have been considered by the Neolithic Person, but would probably only have been possible if they were close enough to friends or families who had food. Taking food from strangers might be too risky, given the limited levels of trust and cooperation present in Neolithic societies.\n7) Option E: \"grow their own food\" can be a feasible solution as the Neolithic period was characterized by the development of agriculture and settlements. They may have had access to land and resources to grow their own food, which allowed them to have a reliable source of sustenance.\n8) Based on these considerations, we can conclude that the most likely solution available to the Neolilthic person would be Option E: grow their own\nfood.\n9) Looking at the answer options we can see that two of the answers include the word 'food', which is incorrect; option A does not match the given context of a Neolithic and non-religious individual; option D has too much text which would be too time-consuming to answer; and option C could be a good solution for some individuals, but not for every situation as mentioned previously.\n10", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": ": pray D: look to the sky E: search nearby\nOutput: 1.) The context of the question can be understood quite easily. The question talks about the Neolithic era and our predecessors in that era were hungry. This means that one of the things that they would do in that era to solve the problem of finding food would be looking for food nearby.\n2.) Therefore, it is safe to assume that hunting and pray won't be their solution to the food problem.\n3.) In searching nearby for food, searching can be classified into two - a) search for food which is readily available in the local area (e.g. plants, water, fish, birds, etc.) and b) search for food which requires a long distance to obtain (e.g. hunting animals).\n4.) In this question, it is important to emphasize when we can and can't say option D) for sure. \n5.) Option D: Looking to the sky sounds similar to option A: thanking God, but there are a couple of factors which we need to consider. \nFirstly, people don't pray when they are starving. When they are starving, people need to find food nearby. Secondly, the context of the question says that person was hungry. In the Neolithic age, looking to the sky can be done in any time of the day or night. When the Neolithic man/woman was hungry, searching nearby was more critical and urgent.\n6.) Based on the above, we can say that looking to the sky can definitely be part of the solution, but it is not enough considering that they were hungry. \nTherefore, the answer is A: thank god.\n7.) Option A: thanking God is an indication that the Neolithic person searched for food nearby and was successful. This is because they found what they are looking for.\n8.) Option B: Hunt for food can be included because they have to look out for nearby foods and hunting them. However, it is too vague and can be considered one of the part of the solution to the problem, but it cannot be 100% confidently considered as the solution.\nSo the final solution is A: thank god\n\nInput: A tree's root system is what?

The neolithic period,' or the 'neolithic era,' describes a time in human history where people first began to cultivate crops and domesticated livestock. Food scarcity was a challenge during this time, and it is believed that finding caves to shelter in was a solution to this problem.\n2. The question refers to the neolithic period, which is an era in human history when people first began to cultivating crops and domesticating live stock.\n3. 'Thank god' implies a the belief in a higher power or God and is not relevant to the solution of food scarcity faced during the neolithic era.\n4. 'Hunt for food' was a solution used during earlier periods of human history when foraging for wild plants and animals was a common practice, similar to how many people rely on hunting today.\n5. 'Inventing agriculture' is not in line with the context and could be referring to the agricultural revolution, which occurred during the Neolithic period but was not the only solution that was used.\n6. 'Pray for rain' does not make sense as people during the neolithc era had little control over weather patterns and there were no religious practices at the time.\n7.

The solution must therefore be a reasonable and practical one.\n2) Looking at the options available, the least likely solution is A: thank god, which essentially suggests that the person should rely on divine intervention for food. It does not include any logical or practical thinking. \n3) The other options available may be reasonable, but none of them actually provide a solution to the Neolithic person's problem. There was a lack of food supply. So, option B: hunt for more food doesn't answer the question, and options C: starve and D: ask for help are not options specifically given in the question.\n4) Based on this assessment, the most likely solution to the Neolitihic person's problem would be option E: gather wild berry and nuts. This solution doesn't require divine intervention or help from others, and it involves logical and practical thinking, which fits in with the given context.\nSo the final answers is E: gather wild berrys and nuts.\n\nInput: She was an aging housewife, and very tired, when she saw this very handsome man.

Choices:  new B low C low-end d cheap E expensive F mid-range\nOutput: 1-10\n1. The question revolves around when to buy or lease new or low-end cars.\n2. According to the dictionary, \"new\" means recently made or originated; recent; freshly prepared or produced; fresh in any way; recent, modern.\n3. \"Low\" means (of a quality or level); low in amount, intensity, or degree; below something in height or magnitude.\n4. \"Low-end\" means cheap; moderate in quality or price.\n5. \"Cheap\" means moderately priced; inexpensive.\n6. \"Expensive\" means costing or involving a great deal of money; costly.\n7. \"Mid-range\" means not high nor low; moderate in amount or kind.\n8. Based on the definition of the six options, it can be concluded that the best answer will be E: expensive. \nSo the answer is E: expensive\n\nInput: What would be a suitable title for a book on the history of the universe?

{"text": ": cook D: eat their dinner E: look for more\nOutput: 1.\"Neolithic\" is a term that refers to the period at the end of the Stone Age, when the use of tools and simple manufacturing processes allowed humans to develop. \n2. During this period, there were several solutions to the problem of \"hungry\", including thanking God, hunting for food, finding the right tool, cooking it, or just eating it raw.\n3. Since the options are either action/solutions or statements that have no real relation to the original context, we can deduce the correct answer in this case.\n4. Option A:\"Thank God\" could be interpreted as a solution or a statement about an action that the hungry person did. Based on context, thanking God may be more of a non-action statement or a religious reference that is out of context in this question. \n5. Therefore, let's eliminate option A: thank god.\n6. Option B:\"Hunt for food\". Hunt implies looking or a solution to the problem and food is one such solution. \n7. So the solution the hungry person could have taken is to \"Hunt for food\".\n8. Option C:\"Cook\". Cooking implies finding a solution to the problem, like a hunt, and hence is excluded. \n9. Option D:\"Eat dinner\". The use of \"Eat dinner\" implies that the person is going to wait till their dinner, hence is not suitable. \n10. Hence, option D:\"Eat their dinner\" is not suitable either since it also implies looking for a solution.\n11. Hence, the remaining options are B: hunt for Food and E: Look for more.\n12. Option B: Hunt for food implies looking for a solution to the problem so it fits better than option E: Look for more because Look for more doesn't really imply action.\n13. Therefore, the answer option for the question is B: Hunt for Food\nSo the final answer b: hunt for food\n\nInput: There is a special bookstore called \"Mom's Kids and Books\".

{"text": ": go fishing D: pick plants\nOutput: 1: The question describes a situation of hunger and the need to find food for survival.\n2. It's clear that the people were dependent on hunting or searching for food, hence an immediate option would be A: hunt for food, which is also backed up by the provided context.\n3. Option C: go fishing is also a viable solution that makes sense according to the given context.\n4. Option A: Thank god doesn't address the issue of hunger or solution to the hunger problem.\n5. Option E: Plants may be necessary at some stage in the solution to hunger, but does not explicitly cater to the 'immediate' problem of hunger.\n6. Hence, from the given set of options, the answer is B: hunting for food\nSo the final answer from the set of options is B: hunting forfood\n\nInput: We are looking for a good book about a great what? Choices: A: country B: battle C: emperor D: empress E: history\nOutput: 1st The question is about finding a book that is about a great subject.\n2nd Option A: Country, doesn't seem to be an appropriate option to choose. While a country could be great, it doesn't capture the entire essence of the word 'great'. However, the other options do provide a possible link to the answer.\n3rd Options B, C provide more context about the need to select a book that is about greatness, and also hint towards the fact that a book on a battle or an emperor could be considered as an option to select. \n4th Option D: \"Empress\" is a potential choice, however, with the context provided, it does not seem to be an appropriate choice.\n5th The answer E: History provides more context about the choice of the book to be selected and also connects well with the previous choice of the battle or greatness.\nSo the final choice among the options is E: History.", "answer": " 66"}

{"text": ": learn how to cook D: eat meat E: eat roots\nOutput: 1.) Before we look into the options, the first thing to note is that the question is not asking what the \"neolithic person\" would do; the question is asking what the neolithic PEOPLE would do.\n2.) People could suggest different answers: \"They should learn how to cook.\" or \"They should hunt down food.\" or \"They should eat meat\", or \"They should learn how not to get hungry by eating roots.\"\n3.) But the question wants to know the solution that all neolithic people would give, not one person's solution.\n4.) Since the neolithic age lasted thousands of years, it is unlikely that one answer would have been a standard solution during this period.\n5.) Furthermore, the options don't describe a single solution. \"Learning to avoid getting hungry\" does not directly address the problem of being unable to find food or hunt for food. \"Eating meat\" is not an answer for everyone in the neolithic culture.\n6.) The only logical answer is E: eat roots - since all neolithic peoples can eat roots as their staple diet.\nSo the final answers is E: eat roots\n\nInput: The answer to this problem depends on a bit of what?

Choices: A: a picnic B: a nap C: for warmth D: summer fun E: keeping things warm\nOutput: 1) A woven blanket is a type of fabric made by weaving different threads together.  Woven blankets can be used for a variety of purposes, including for nap, picnic, and to keep things warm.\n2) Since a woven blanket is made from different threads that have been woven together, it is a versatile textile that is good for a variety of uses. \n3) Woven blankets are usually made from cotton, but they can also be made from other materials such as wool,silk and linen.\n4) When it comes to the specific uses of a woven blanket, they can be used for keeping things warm like at a picnic or on a nap.\n5) However, a woven blanket can also be used for summer fun like swimming and picnics. \n6) Therefore, the correct option would be to choose A as this would be the most versatile and appropriate use of a woven blankest because it can be used for a wide range of activities.\nSo the final answe is E: Keeping thing warm \n\nInput: A man got angry because he found an earring on the desk.

Choices: using less space for parking vehicles A: reducing dependence on fossil fuels B: stopping the habit of spending too much money at parties C: using public transport instead of private transport D: eating more fish E: growing more vegetables\nOutput: 1.) The problem in India is the food shortage. \n\n2.) The solution that needs to be implemented to solve this issue is not the choice to spend less and have parking spaces, grow more vegetables, eat less fish, don't spend money in parties and stop driving private transport.\n\n3.) The only way to implement the solution to the food problem in India is by choice number (C), not by any of the other choices given.\n\n4.) Option C states that the only way to address food problems in India is to stop having so many private vehicles as the sole means of transport in the country.\n\n5.) This would encourage Indians to take or use public transport instead of their private cars/cars, leading to savings in money, time, and food transportation.", "answer": " 100"}
{"text": ": create tools D: make a fire E: farm\nOutput: 1) Firstly, we observe and understand the context in which the question is being asked.\n2) The context in which the question was asked is about the hunter-gatherer lifestyle, characterized by hunting and gathering plants and animals for sustenance.\n3) The question is asking about \"their\" solution to the problem of hunger, implying that the hunter-gathers had multiple options to resolve their issue, and chose the option which they deemed to be the most effective.\n4) All of the other choices are vague and/or inaccurate depictions of how hunter-gatherers used to perceive the issue of hunger and how they chose to resolve it.\n5) \"Thank God\" doesn't seem to be a valid option as it would imply that the hunter- gatherer depended on an external entity for their survival instead of finding their own solution. This is incorrect as hunter-gather lifestyle is completely dependent on one's own perception of reality and one's own abilities to survive.\n6) Hunt does not include any specific activity nor does it provide any indication of the desired activity of that hunting for food. On the contrary, it's an activity that may not be relevant to the current question.\n7) To create tools and make a fire are valid choices as these are important elements in the hunter-gathereer way of life.\n8) Farming is also important in the hunter-hargatheres lifestyle, albeit not as relevant in that it implies a certain type of farming that is not directly related to the current question. Therefore, the answer could be C, D, or E\n9) C) create tools makes the most sense as it provides a way to tackle the issue of hunger without depending on others and without relying on external entities for survival.\n10) Further research can be done by expanding on the current choice: why do hunters-gatherers create a specific type of tool? Which type of tool is used by hunters-gatheres? etc. However, the given 2 options seem to be the most appropriate.\n11) So the final answer is C) Create tools\nSo the final answer would be C) Create tools\n\n##", "answer": " 2"}

The question is hinting towards the possible solution that may have been found and implemented by these people.\n2: The term \u201cpigs\u201d is being used in the text to show that the Neolithic people used to catch prey like pigs and store them in pigsties.\n4: The term thanking god is being used in the given sentence to show that the Nealithic people believed in their myth of their food being from the god.\n5: The meaning of the term \"steals the fruit\" is being used to show that the Neaithic people believed that they should steal the fruits from the trees.\n6: We are being asked which one of the options is the correct answer and not to pick any from them. However, given the context in which the option is being used in the sentence, we can conclude from the text in the given options that the correct answer can be E - to steal fruit.\n7: Since the Neaithic were in dire need of food, they hunted for pigs and stored them in pigstyes which were kept in their homes. The option D suggests that they caught pigs and killed them which is contrary to the given text and the option A also does not align. \n8: The option B can be eliminated because it does not provide any context for how the Neaithic solved their problems and does not suggest anything that the Neaithc might have done to get food.\n9:  We can conclude from the text that the Neaithics solved the problem of food by stealing the fruits and vegetables from the trees which is confirmed in the option E and also suggests that the Neaithcs did the hunting and gathering of food during that time.\n10: Therefore, the answer is that the Neaithlic people stole the fruits and vegetable from the trees.\nSo the final choice is that option E: to steal fruit.

The neolithic period pre-dates the invention and domestication of animals, so the question is talking about when they hunted or farmed, i.e. food obtained through tools. \n3. The options therefore exclude A, which talks about religion.\n4. Questions like \"where to find food\" and \"how to find food\" are not relevant when talking about the answer to the question, unless there's an indication of their relevance.\n5. The period was also long before the existence of towns, mayors or political governance. \n6. Therefore, we can exclude B (hunt for food) and D (ask for town mayor to get food).\n7. The only relevant option left would be C (use tools).\n8. The neolithc period in Europe began with the domestication of the dog, sheep and goats.\n9. Therefore the answer is C: use tools.\nSo the final question is C: use tools\n\nInput: Some parents like to spend time playing video games.  Kids often say this is the worst thing parent do for them.  Why do some parentts do this?

We can assume that other options were not chosen as the only viable solution. \n2. Choice D is related to creating tools, which is an appropriate approach if other options were closed because of unforeseen circumstances. However, in the absence of alternative options, it is more likely that a Neolithic person would find a way to increase available food sources.\n3. Choice B is a possible solution if other options are unavailable due to lack of knowledge or resources. However, the question does not mention any such limitations, so this choice is less likely.\n4. Choice C is a possible solution if there is not enough food available in the immediate surroundings. However, if there is limited food supply within the reach of the Neolithic person, they are more likely to turn to choice A.\n5. Choice E is related to building weapons, which could be an option if all other options are not feasible. However, we can assume that this option would not be the first resort of a Neolithic people in a situation where they face a hunger problem.\n6.

All of which would require tools that were developed after the period of the neolithic.\n5) Option C Growing crops\" would indicate farming, which is something that would have become widespread during the neolithic period.\n6) Option D Building a Fire\" requires materials and tools. This could also refer to building a fire to cook food or to keep warm as well.

However, this method is not an immediate solution for a person who is hungry and lacks access to food resources.\n6 The option D 'eat a small animal' would be a viable solution but would only provide temporary relief, as the neolithic person would still be facing the problem of food scarcity.\n7 The option E 'hunt for a large animal' may have worked, but it would have been a risky solution and might result in the person being unable to find enough meat to survive on.\n8 Therefore, the most appropriate choice is C 'cook'.\nSo the final answer was C: cook.\n\nInput: For years the town people feared the evil.

{"text": ": pray D: search for mast E: search for fruit\nOutput: 1: The first thing to note in this question is the word \"were\", which indicates the answer should be in past tense. Next, consider the context of the question, which involves a neolithic person and their difficulty in finding food. \n2. From the context, the person was likely to have come up with a solution to their food problem, which could mean hunting for food, praying for it, or searching for it. \n3. Looking at the options, A \"thank god\" could potentially mean that the person was grateful for what they had received or it could have been a prayer to a higher being. However, this doesn't directly address the problem of finding food.\n4. Option B \"hunt for food\" could refer to the person actively looking for food or searching for it. This could be done by a variety of means, such as through hunting or other means of gathering food. However, again, this doesn't address the specific issue of finding food. \n5. Option C \"praying for it\" could refer to praying to a Divinity or higher being, hoping that they will provide the person with food. While this might address their hunger in the end, it's not a direct solution to the immediate problem of lack of food.\n6. Option D \"search for mast\" could be referring to a specific type of food source, such as nuts or berries. However, this doesn;t address the broader issue of the person being hungry.\n7. Option e E \"search for fruit) could specifically referring to looking for fruit as a source of food, which could likely address the person's hunger, provided they have access to fruit.\n8. Therefore, from the context and options, the answer is likely E: search for fruit. \nSo the final answer in this case is E: search for fruit", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": ": search for food D: pray for food E: fast for food\nOutput: First, we look at the context. We need to understand what a neolithic person is and what they do.\n1. We find that a neolithic people hunted and ate animals. We also find that they farmed crops.\n2. Based on this context, we can understand that the only correct option for this question is choice D: pray for food.\n3. The neolithic people did not pray to God, so options A and B are incorrect.\n4. Option E: fast for food may apply to their diet, but not to their overall situation.\n5. Option C: search for food may be applicable, but since options A through E are out, we can rule out all non-prayer-related options.\n6. So the final answer is D.: Pray for food.\nSo the final answers are D.: Pray for Food\n\nInput: He ate the most expensive steak he had ever seen. How was it cooked?  Choices:  A B C D E\nOutput: 1.: The question states that there is a steak in front of a man that is the most expensive he's ever seen. It is unclear if there are other expensive steaks to compare it to which makes the context a little vague.\n2.: The options offered are: \u201cmedium-rare steak\u201d (or medium rare), \u201crare steak\u201d (the most basic), \u201cseared\u201d or \u201cwell-done\u201d. Medium-rare, rare, and seared all require cooking the steak, it is not clear if well-done is intended to be cooked or not.\n3.: Well-done would indicate that the steak has been cooked but does not necessarily mean fully-cooked. We cannot rule out that well-done refers to a raw state.\n4.: All of the options provided require the steak to be cooked so they are irrelevant.\n5.: The answer must be B \u201crare\u201d steak. This is the least cooked steak, it is well-done enough for the man to eat and not deadly, making it the best choice for him.\nSo the final solutions are E: A: rare option which is the one the best for him.\n\nInput: What did the hunter do last?

{"text": ": invent a grinder D: invent the wheel E: invent pottery\nOutput: 1) The question refers to the Neolithic era, a time period during which a transformation from hunting to agriculture occurred.\n2) During this time period, people developed advanced knowledge and skills in food preparation through the invention of the wheel, pottery, and grinding methods.\n3) From this context, we can deduce the most likely answer to be one that involves invention and food preparation skills.\n4) Options B and D do not involve any invention or preparation skills, so they can be eliminated.\n5) Option A involves thanking god, which is a relatively recent practice that was not common during Neolithic times. \n6) Option C involves the invention of grinding, but this is a relatively recent invention and not something practiced during Neolithic era.\n7) Option E includes the invention of pottery that was developed during the Neolithic times, however, the grinding process did not require a wheel to be developed to make pottery, so this option cannot be selected.\n8) Therefore, the answer is likely option E.\n9) The invention of pottery is closely tied to the invention of the grinder and was an essential part of food preparation during that era. \n10) Therefore, the answer has to be E: invent pottery.\nSo the final  answer is E: invent pottery", "answer": " 134"}
{"text": ": grow D: make fire E: cook food\nOutput: 1, The question tells us that the Neolithic person was experiencing hunger and needed to seek a solution to their problem.\n2. The options given consist of solutions that could be applied by a Neolithic person to address their hunger, based on technology/tools available at the time.\n3. Option A \"thank god\" is not a feasible solution as this doesn't directly address the problem.\n4. Option B \"hunt for food\" is an alternative solution, however, the neolithic person would have been required to wait for a food source to come to them. \n5. Option C \"grow\" is another alternative option, although the neolithic people were primarily herbivores, not necessarily hunter-gatherers which makes this option invalid.\n6. Option D \"make fire\" is possibly the closest fitting answer as it matches the ability of the neolithic age to create fire and cook a meal.\n7. Option D was correctly applied, making it the correct answer.\nSo the final awnsrer is D: Make fire\n\nInput: Why do they say to make bread in a ___? Choices: 1. A: microwave 2. B: electric stove 3.

{"text": ": collecting nuts and seeds D: catch some fish E: eat berries\nOutput: 1) The neolithic people were hungry since they were at the prehistoric period of development.\n2) The options given are: Thanking God, Hunting for food, collecting nuts and berries or catching some fish.\n3) The most likely solution for the problem of hunger after the neolith age was collecting nuts and fruits, or gathering together.\n4) Berries are fruits which require no fishing nor hunting and the option A should be ruled out.\n\n5) Collecting nuts and seal and catching some fish requires one to first hunt before they can satisfy their hunger.\n6) Option B is also less likely since it suggests the solution of the problem was to hunt for food.\n\n7) The only suitable option remains is D. The neolithic culture was more advanced than that of the hunter - gatherer. Hence, they had a system of agriculture and pastoralism where they raised livestock for their sustenance.\n\nSo, the answer should be D.\n\nInput: We must act like adults  and not behave like what?

So, we need to understand what is a store and what kind of name refers to a store.\n2 The question states that a person goes with a few friends to the store, and that person tells a few people the name. So, based on this information, we can infer that the options refer to the names of stores.\n3 The question states that \"the person told a few people\". So, this implies that \"few\" is", "answer": " 567"}
{"text": ": planting D: eating meat E: praying for meat\nOutput: 1.) The question talks about the \"problem\" faced by the person referred to in the sentence \"The neolithic person...\". The problem seems to be a \"hunger\", which needs to be resolved.\n2.) The options given seem to reflect an effective, or at least plausible, solution to solve the hunger of the described individual.\n3.) The option A \"Thank god\" is not specific to the given problem, as it does not mention anything about the person's hunger level.\n4.) The option B \"Hunt for food\" does not seem like a specific solution for the person's hungerness, even though it could work in some extreme situations.\n5.) The option C \"Planting\" does not seem like the solution due to the fact that the option specifically mentions \"meat,\" which is only obtained through hunting or other means of non-plant-based food acquisition.\n6.) The options D \"Eating meat\" and E \"Praying for meat\" seem like the most likely solutions, as they are specific to the hunger problem posed. It's possible that the person in question could have gone to a hunter-gatherer tribe and tried to get meat from them, or that they could have asked for meat to be offered as a sacrifice or other religious ritual. This option would've been a viable solution in the neolithic period, when hunting was a common way of obtaining meat.\n7.) So, it seems like the most likely option is D: eating meat.\n\nInput: The new teacher was excited to meet her students.

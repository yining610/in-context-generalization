Wickham plans food for 4 different courses and each course uses a new plate. In total, 4\u00d730=120 guests is served 4 courses of food. Since we have 20 plates for the first course, plus 12 for the second, 30 for the third and 40 for the fourth, 40+12+30+40=142 plates are used for the party, making the answer choice A, 142.\nIn Example 3, The correct answer is A, 271, because there are 13 people invited to the party. If everyone brings a plus one, there are 26 people at the party in all. If he uses a single plate per person, there will be 26 plates for the first two courses and 13 plates for the last two courses, making 56 plates total. However, if he uses a single plate for two people on each course, there will be 13 plates on the first two courses, plus 26 plates on the last two courses, leaving 161 plates total.

If the number of students in both classes had remained the same, half as many students from the math class as students from the English class would have passed the test.How many students were in the math class (A)?\nOutput: A: 20\n\nInput: The math teacher asked each student enrolled to choose the number he or she wanted for an experiment. In order to do so, the students were asked to first subtract the number 4 from the product of the sum of the number and the number chosen, so that the product of the given number and the chosen number would be greater than or equal to 10,000.For example, the number chosen cannot be 5 because 4 x 5 = 20, which is < 10,030, and the number chosen cannot be less than 1. The 2 that was chosen by each student had to satisfy this requirement. The experiment involved adding pairs of numbers together that were less than or equal to 6, or subtracting pairs of numbers together that had at least one number less than 3 and another number greater than or equal to one, in order to find a number that is divisible by 36.What was the number that was chosen by each of the 81 students?\nOutput:D: 60178\n\n### Instruction:Answer the questions below using the formula for a linear regression line (see below).\n\nInput:The math teacher asked each student in the class to choose a number between 0 and 9.

To ensure the numbers chosen could not be negative, the students were also not able to choose the number 5. For example, if a student chose 2 and then square his choice, that number would be 4; because the square of 2 is 4.

{"text": "$2000\n\n### Task:\n\nThis assignment is designed to strengthen your python programming skills specifically those related to the following: reading from a file, processing files, and outputting to a file.\n\nFor this assignment, you do not need to write a function to process the file, but instead simply process the contents of the file using a loop, and output to a new file. You must do the processing of the file, save it, exit the program successfully, and print to the console that the file has been created. You must use the file name as the filename of the new file.\n\nNote: If you have previously used any loops, such as for loop or counter, or nested loops (or even nested counters), you should be able to apply those concepts to this assignment.\n\nNote: This assignment is designed to help strengthen your programming skills so try to come up with a way to program this assignment using multiple if/else statements or nested if/else statements. If you only use one if/else statement, you will not receive full credit. \n\nNote: In order to make progress on this assignment, you may need to copy portions of the file processing code from this site (see the resources section below).\n\nResources:\n\n - [http://www.learnpython.com/tutorial-reading-files-in-python/](http://www.learnprogramming.com/tutorial-the-file-object-in-python/\n\n - [https://pythonprogramming.net/python-read-and-write-text-files/](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/how-to-read-files-in-csv-format-in-python\n\n\n---\n\n### Solutions: \n\nFor each of the three files, the student who works on this assignment should use the following script to create a new data file (with the file name being the name of the original file) using the contents in the original file and save it to a new file:\n\nScript (main.py):\n\n```python\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n  import sys, os\n\n  # Read file line by line\n  file_line = open(sys.argv[1]).read()\n\n  for line in file_line:\n    # Split the line into a 2 item array\n    item_arr =", "answer": " 820"}

How much more do they cost?\nOutput:\n```\n\n### Instruction:Solution\n\n```\nCats, like any animal, needs a place to stay where they are protected from the elements. However, not all animals need a home; cats are indoor only animals, which is why they need to stay with you rather than with the litter box. That is why they will not stay in a birdhouse on a sunny day and why they would not be found anywhere else, either.\nThe only place you can take a cat is to the zoo, so if you found this on the street it would be safe to bring your cat inside to get it back home.\nThe vase in a restaurant is usually there to display whatever flowers are available or used to decorate the inside and out of the restaurant. Not every establishment has a vase, but most do because it has been established as a norm in society.\n\nYou can either work from the top down, or work from the bottom up; either way, the most important thing that you are looking for is the number of digits that are represented by the number that you are working with.\nIf there are more digits than what you currently have at your disposal, then you need to go back and multiply by 10 and subtract 1. This means that the number of digits needs to go down by one and the number of digits that you still can't figure out needs to go up by one.\n\nCats, like many other animals, need a place to stay to shield them from the elements. However not all animals should stay in the outside, the cats, for example, are indoors only animals. Therefore they would not be located anywhere else such as a birdhouse on a bright day.\n\nThe robots have to have room inside the restaurant, so if they were outside or hiding somewhere else it would not be safe to move inside the establishment.\n\nIn the case of a robot, this is the only place it could be found since it is part of the establishment and therefore safe to take inside with you.", "answer": " 80"}

On the other hand Cindy and Jasmine thought differently starting off with B. Cindy and Jazmine are new but have been doing well so if they're on the right path. I tried the input in my textbook and it was correct but I guessed it was wrong as on the other computer, it was correct so I tried it on other students. \nAs Matt was waiting for the response, he tried the other input  and the computer replied with D: residence and he then understood he made a mistake and also because the textbook said there was no example in the answer. Matt's answer is B: prepare dinner as he is learning to include examples in his answer.\n\n#### 1;15p.m - Second Instant \nMs.Graham entered the room and asked for Jasmine and Cindy. She handed Cindy's a worksheet titled: math grade three (1,5,7) and gave it to Jasmine. She also told them to show her how they would solve their own question. Matt went on his own and started doing the question and he also tried the other question before entering this one that includes 'progress' so he ended up on A: front door as he thought it contains progress as he was able to solve the question with the help of examples. On the other computers though and in my book, the answer was D: residence which the textbook did not include as it mentioned: grade four questions only. \nJasmine also thought about the answer and she ended up on D: example and she said she's not prepared at all so she had to find an example to help her solve the question. As it turns out, there was an example of a vase on a table as they have many in the house and not just one. \nMs. Graham then showed up in Matt's computer and asked, were you supposed to give us answers that are correct and show us all the steps to prove your work.

For example, if the numbers were drawn from 1 through 5 ( 1,...,5) the tickets would have 1,... 5.  It is known that the odds of winning a large bingo in a game of this type are about 1 in 500 of all players.  A player wins a large bingo if he or she is the first to match 5 of the same type of numbers in the least possible numbers on any board.  For example, in a game where the numbers are 1 through 20, winning a large bingo requires matching 1 through 5 on any of the first to fifth boards.  A player with a large bingo wins all the money in the pot, and the person who matches a large bingo on the 5th board is the best paid player for a win.

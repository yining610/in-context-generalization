So that is 2 hours because I went 10 miles the first way and I will then go 55 miles in the 2nd way. So that will be 2 hours. In the next part I need to add 2 hours and 1 mile because I drive 1 mile for every 2 minutes that I am driving. So multiplying 2 by 2 will make 2x2=4 minutes. Then I would add 4 minutes to 2 hours so that it will be 2 and a half hours.

{"text": "In order for us to solve this question, we first would need to know whether we are solving $2x + 2 = 7x$ or $2x + 4 = 7x$. Our strategy to solve 2x + 2- = 7x is to isolate $x$, and then solve $x = 2/7$ and $x = 7/2$. Now, our strategy to solve $2x + 7 - $ 4= 7x is to subtract 7x-4, and solve for $x$. Thus, we get $x = 7 - 4/7$. This is a common approach to solving two variable functions, and is actually not wrong. However, this is not the way the teacher wants us to solve questions. The teacher requires us to actually evaluate the two separate expressions and show the work.\nThus, to solve the problem, we first must find a general rule to determine what variable needs to be solved for on the given equations. I don't know if we want to call this the \"method of \" or if it is the \"method of \" but for this question a good rule of thumb would be: If there are two separate variables $x$ and $y$ in the equation and $y$ by itself is a 1 or more than 1, then you will need to find the rule $x$ by itself on each individual equation.\n\nIn this question we have the two expressions: $2x + 5 = 4x$ and $2x + 10 = 5x$. In solving these we see that the rule for $x$ is $x = 4 = 5$, and this means that we can solve these two problems by adding 4 and 5 times x. This allows us to solve for x, in this case. Thus, the x variable is now isolated. Now we just solve for each of these equations of x individually, and we end up with x = 1. Thus, the correct answer to this question is x = 1, which is the same answer that we would get if we just solved for $x$ and then added $1$ and $4$ to the answer. This helps you determine $x$, and thus allows you to find $y$, which is how many heads of lettuce and tomatoe do the villagers buy this month? Thus: x = 250, y", "answer": " 2000"}

We can do either a tree diagram, by hand, or a simpler one by using software such as excel.\n\nIf we want to find the number that contains the digit 1, we can simplify a bit and say that there are 11 digits left to choose, if we want to choose the digit 1 from 0-9. Once we select the 3 digits in between 0-9, we have 11 possibilities. Next, we have 13 digits left (12 after we chooses 3 digits from 0-9). Selecting one of the 13 remaining digits, we have 12 possibilities. Lastly, selecting one of the 12 remaining digits will produce 11 possibilities. Now, summing all the possibilities, we find that the number of possible outcomes is 12+13+11+10/12. If you want to know how to simplify this, watch this video\n[How to Add and Simplify Fractions](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk-zq_V863U).\n\nWe are looking for the final number of possible outcomes and we can write it as 1/12.

You will use the steps in the order they're in (you go from left to right and from bottom to top, that's why I suggest using the steps). Use a number line (drawing lines on your paper). You shouldn't forget to read the problem and underline all the important ideas. When you use a calculator, make sure to show the teacher what you are doing (it's best to show them how to use it when you are done, that way you can get credit for it). When you write the answer, explain how you got to where you did. This means to write a sentence like \"Wanda weighed 1200 pounds\" or it can be something like \"30 more than Yola so add 30 to 220\". Whatever you do, please explain the steps (it is not enough to show where you wrote out the numbers). Please also show how you found the answer. You may use math formulas if appropriate. It's also good to use pictures to help solve the problem if it's a problem that will lend itself to a drawing. Lastly, you have to be able to explain where you're going with the problem. For example, if the problem is to divide 15 by 3, tell Mr. Burtz \"I will make a 0 for 1, 5 for 3, and a 2 for the whole problem. Then I will take the 5 and subtract 0 to make it 3. This means to put 3 into the problem to get 3 whole and 0 remains\"\n\n### Input Solution:\n### Instructions:\nWanda weighs\n\n### Democracy:\nInput: Where did you put the car keys?

{"text": "Input: Write a command to compute the required answer.\nAnswer: C: 54 hours.\n\nThe total number of hours that Jerry will spend watching games and practice in 8 games and 2 hours each is 4 + (8/2) x 2 = 12 + 4 = 16 hours. Add the practice time (4) and the game time (2) and you get 16 + 4 + 2 = 22 + 4= 26. But, you do not play the game during practice, so it is 26-4= 22.\nAnd then you multiply 22 by 8 games=22 x 8 = 176. You also subtract 4 from the 26 to account for practice during games: 22 x 8 + (26-4) = 176 + 22 = 198 hours.\nAnd finally, you divide by 2 (since each game is 2 hours) and you get 80 hours total.\nTotal: You should spend 4 hours watching each game and another 4 practicing. 8 games means your time is doubled for a total of 8 games multiplied by 2 hours each (16) =24 hours; 16 hours of watching + 16 hours of practice = 32 hours.\n\n\n### Input and Response:\nInput: Mary is planning to go to the mall later tonight to buy her brother an action figure gift.

{"text": "In the book, Hans asked the clerk where the hotel kept spare clothes when the hotel was used for events. The clerk replied that guests would find spare clothes in the floor rooms, that the clerk had to pass to get to their floor. The clerk knew of 4 clerked rooms available and in the book Hans was able to locate spare clothes in the floor with a spare room. Hans booked that floor.  \nThe hotel had 10 rooms per floor so Hans could have been in any of 100 rooms.  Of the 100 rooms, 4 rooms have spare clothes. Hans could have been in one the 4 rooms with spare clothes but not all of them. So in how many different rooms do Hans could have been booked in? To calculate the answer I would use probability. So the question would become, what is the probability of Hans finding the room with spare clothes when he is looking for a spare dress room. The clerk told Hans in the book that the odds are 4:1 against him finding spare clothes. He could have been one of the 4 that did. The probability that Hans is in a different room than the 4 clerk rooms was 96:1. So the probability of Hans being in any of the 100 hotel rooms is (1/4)100 or.0000136.\n\nThe probability of Hans being in the 4 clerked hotel rooms is (4/100)10 or.040004\nTotal probability, probability of Hans being in one of the 4 clerk hotel rooms or probability Hans being in any of 199 hotel rooms (1/4)99+ (4/10)100 =.0000442 OR.0441%. The probability that Hans has any of the 4 clotted hotel rooms is thus.95586%. Because we are dealing with probability, the answer of this problem will always be a percentage. The correct answer to the question I believe should be a percentage of.9558%.\n\n### Input The shrewd clerk at the local pet store told me he could take care of my cat problem in exactly 10 minutes.

Choice: A, B, C, E\n\n### Response E: You will have to factor in room & board, but, for our sample calculation, we will \nassume that your daughter is only paying tuition & fees and will save on room & board because \nshe lives with you. Tuition may increase from year to year, but, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, tuition growth has decreased since 2013. If tuition costs $22,000 per year now, in the \nlast four years we have seen a 45 percent increase. Your daughter\u2019s tuition for the next four \nyears will cost you just over $76.000, because year 3 is 30 percent cheaper than year 2. Room \n& board will increase each year, but let\u2019s assume it is 15 percent per year, so, for year 3, it will \ncost $18,150 and for year 4, $21,325. Thus, your daughter\u2019s total living expenses in year 3 \nwill be roughly $29,075, and in year 4, $33,325\n\n### Input B:\nKaty's friend, Alex, gets $8600 for her birthday.

{"text": "The initial price of the magazine is $34, however each of their 18 issues has a dollar discount applied. We can say that the normal price of each issue is $33, so the total price of the 18 issues is $594. If we assume that we are looking at a \"twice-monthly\" subscription, each issue is a 6 month subscription, but let's call it 6 issues to make the math easier. Therefore, each individual issue has an initial price of $33, and we can say that the two issues at the end of the subscription costs $66 for a total subscription price of $594. So, the $0.25 discount on two of the six issues is enough to make the magazine only cost $589.25, meaning the total we saved is $3.75.\n\n### Response\nThe initial price of each magazine is $34 but the two-for-$6 subscription will cost only $112: $112 is 6 times $33.\n\n1. $33 is the price after 6 months, since each issue takes 6 months.\n1.

Using the same 55 as the hours, he can use the equation: 55 = 8.22 * n where n is the number of hours Joey worked and 8.22 is the wage for the lawn work.\n\nThus, the number of hours Joya needs to mow to earn enough for the shoes is given by n=55/8.22. \n\nThe total number of hours Joey needs to mow 3 lawns and work at the jobs is: n = 2+m+e where m is the number of hours he worked selling the figures and e is the number of hours worked at his afterschool job. \n\nSince the total number of hours needed to find the price is 90, n = 90/2+m+e,\n\nn = 45(m+e).\n\nThis requires that we solve for e, given a certain m.\n\nIf m = (55-8.22*45)/(0.22*40) then the number of hours needed to equal $55 at Joey\u2019s lawn mowing job is m = 30. \n\nThe number of hours Joey needed to do lawns and  work his after school job is therefore:\n\nn= m+e = 30+e.\n\nThe number of lawns Joye needs to mow to collect the money for the sneakers is  m = 30 / 3 = 10.

{"text": "### Explanation\nThis is another case of the answer key is hard to provide because there are so many possibilities.\n\n\n\nThis is my attempt but the answer key is not really complete as it could have been written differently and would have been easier to follow which then would have resulted in less errors:\n\n- Derek: `5<2*`(4)=5\n- Tammy: `14<4*`(21) => 35*12 => 420\n- Joe: 23-5=18 18-35<4=106\n- therefore Joe caught the ball 16 more than a third of times. Derek caught 5 less than 2 times. Tammy caught 2/3 of 106 = 68 times\n\n106 is the result of 68 and 35\n68 is the result of a third of 210\n106=68+35 because 210 is double the number of catches. 106 should be written as 17 catches (half of 20)\n106=17+35 = 52\n\n52 is the result of the number of balls * the number of times each child has caught more than Tammy. Tammy has caught the ball more than the number that were caught.\n\n106/3 is equivalent to multiplying by 35. So there are 35 catches less than when Derek/Tammy were done.\n\n### Screenshot\n\n![answer](./img/img175.png)\n\n### Check answer:\n\n### Reference:\n\n### Check Answers:\n\n<a href=\"https://youtu.be/80x-U5V-w-4\">Link</a>", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "Answer: You can park 800 cars. There are 2500 square feet used to park cars.\n\n\\begin{code}\n(2500/10) cars\n\\end{code}\n\nAnswer: Answer: 2500\n\nAnswer: You have only used 25% of each parking lot so there are other uses for the rest of that area.  For every foot you have only used a 4 inch (10ft/25) percent so the answer is 2500 cars.\n\n### Input\n\nAnswer: You are trying to convert a fraction like 3/8 to a percentage.  What you do is multiply the numerator and denominator by 100%.  Then the number you get is the percentage.  In this case, 3/8 =  37.5%.  So 3 is 3/4 of the total of 8 divided by 8.  So if you are given 87/43/49, 88/44/46, or 29/4/30/7 there are 8/4/4/7 ways to make 1 whole percent(2/5ths).  If you only have the fraction you must remember that for every single percent they are divided by 100(4/5/6).  If you put it in as a decimal and it is greater than 4/5 divide it by 100.  If you multiply it by 25 you must multiply 25 by 47 to get the closest number to 100.\n\n### Answer\n\nThere are 8 ways to make 1 fractional percent so if you are given 37/8 you can simply break it down to 3/4 of 8/4 which rounds down to every 8th.\n\nAnswer: You need to figure out how to make 1 percent out of the given numbers.  Since the numbers you are given are percentages, you can figure out how to make every percent of the sum.

The factors are 1, 2A.  A perfect square is a number that when you square it equals it.  So a perfect square has to be one when it is multiplied by itself. 2A = 2A, so the number is even though it is not a perfect square. You know that if a number is even if you can divide it into two equal fractions.   \n\nThis will work as long as there are only prime numbers and 1.  You need one or two even numbers and two odd numbers to work to square the number back to the same number.

{"text": "Let P1,P2,P3 be the chapters read by Mitchell before 4, remaining 11th chapter and 2 new chapters respectively. Let X be the total number of pages read by Mitchell.\n\nBy the way that this question is worded, X can either be even or odd.\n\nWe have X = \\em{P1 + P2 + P3}\n\nIf X is odd, then P3 must be less than P1 or P2. Since P2 is at least 10 pages, and there's a total of 11 chapters for Mitchell to read with each chapter having a total of 40 pages, then P3 cannot be less than P2. Therefore the total number of pages Mitchell read equals P1 + P2 + 20.\n\nThis is because X was an odd number equaling 32, of which 10 is a multiple since 710 = 32 as n7-1\n\nIf X is even, then 20 is the same as 19. If P3 is odd, this means Mitchell read 20 pages. However, 20 is not even, so P3 must be equal to 21.\nThis is because X is even, and 19 is a divisible of 19.\n\nTherefore if X is even, then we have P1 + P2 = 48, as P1 = P2 = 24.

{"text": "In school we learned that the way to solve a question like this is to draw out a number line. Then label each number with the sentence, \"This many more than that\". Start writing on the line. Start with the biggest value and put all the other values on top of it, smaller and smaller. Then make a mark where they all meet and that is the answer.\n\n### Justification: Draw a number line on a piece of scrap paper and label each number such as, \u201cI made this many more than that.\u201d Then just draw a line from number 111 down to 50 and 111 will be the top and it's value is 61 or 62.\n\n### Input\nInput: A man paid $49.62, then $24.59, and then $39.40.

This student did not know answer to any of the questions. I can't find out anything about this students math level because I have no idea what they are supposed to know. My classmates and I are talking about this topic but we have no way of writing the answer.\n\n**Write an appropriate response that provides a response that provides a response explaining how the student could be helped.**\n\n### Response \n\nResponse: I think that if this student really doesn't know anything about math they deserve the time that we have in class to learn. It is not the job of a teacher to teach the students math, it is my job. I think that they would be helping the student more if they were actually helping them learn instead of telling everyone that they don't know anything about it.\n\n### Explanation: Students should have help from the teacher to learn something they don't understand.

Since he is an engineer, he plans out his routes and trips to make sure that he will be safe and won't get lost.  He is in the mountains for a few weeks and he plans on returning the third week.  However, he may be stuck for a bit longer if the weather is difficult.  He brings with him 30 days worth of food and water for himself.  Then, after a week, he will return to the village to visit his friends and tell about the beauty of the mountains.  Then, he will head home.  How long will Freddy take to return home?\n\n### Demostration:\nYou have determined that he will eat 20 days of food and will spend 7 days in the village. So the problem is to determine the number of days he stays on the mountain. It is $20n +7k$, where $n = 20$ and $k = 7$. $20n+7k$ is $27$, which means he goes in for a week in the village. So you take away the 7 days he already spent in the village and then $20$ days of food, the answer is 16 days.\n\n### Final response:\nHansel will make more money than Gretel, even with her new 15% raise because they have the same amount of earned income ($30,00). Additionally, since Gretel received a 15%, but Hansel only a 10% increase, Hansel only had a increase of $4,200 and Gretel a $5,500 increase.

When a company is established or started, the first year is called the \"first year of business.\" In this case, the first year's annual expenditure is 500%\n\nThe money or the asset, expenditure, is the money that does not leave the organization after it is issued by the organization. The money or the asset that comes out after the organization's finances, capital, etc. is called income or capital. There are three basic types of income, 1. Real income, 2. Fictitious income, 3. Expected income.\n\nNet income is calculated by deducting the expenses from the income. To complete the profit formula, we need to know that the income must be calculated by subtracting the profit margin from the net income. That is to say, the net income is subtracted from the profit margin and subtracted by the profit margin. This is the formula for finding the profit margin.\n\nThe farmer spent 300 dollars to raise corn for the first time. This is the actual expenditure. The profit margin at this time is (100-300)/300 * 100 = 70%.\n\nIf the profit margin is added to the profit income, the profit income will be doubled. To complete the profit, the income is added by the profit margin; that is to say, the income of the year is added by the profit of the profit margin.

If you knew you would finish one mile before your friend, how fast do you need to run to keep your current speed to finish before him? To solve this problem:  Bob runs at 6/hour Jim runs at 9/hour  If Bob has a 6/hr advantage Bob would run until he ran 6/(his speed - advantage). Therefore, Bob would run 6/(6-1) Jim would run at 9 since he has to catch Bob Jim will still end up running 6 when he catches Bob since Bob is already at 6.

The number of pallets that are paper towels is 10 pallets, so write T as 10. Now find the total number of palats that contain paper towels, tissues, and paper plates. Write the variable for this total number of pallets as P. The number of pallet of these products is 8 pallets (1/2 of the 16 total pallets). Write P as 8. Now simply write the total number of palatts (the number of paper cups and tissues) as 1/4 of the sum of the number of paper towels and paper plates, which is a=10-8. Therefore, write P as a. Write T as 10 and a as.\nThis means that the store would recieve 10 pallet of paper towels, 8 palatts with tissues and paper plates, and 1 pallet with paper cups.

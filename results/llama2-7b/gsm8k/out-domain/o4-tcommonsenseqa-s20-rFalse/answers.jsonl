If the noun was not plural, we can use it with 'is doing'\n\nIf we had a singular noun, the verb would be singular.\nIf we have an object noun, or adjective noun, we use the same verb 'does'\n\nIf the word 'the' starts a sentence, the sentence is indefinite.

{"text": "The answer is approximately $29,600.00\n\n### Example:\n#### The first question, \"How many gallons are in a tank of gas?\"\n\n#### Demonstration: First thing we want to know is how much gas does the tank hold. This is the only question in which we do not care about what the machine is doing; we just care what it holds. The tank holds five gallons; this is our unknown. We can assume 100 for the other unknowns and we must pick an answer. We must choose to eliminate answer \"A. 2500.0\" because it is higher than the other possible values. This left us with answer \"D.  2000.0\". We now know the total capacity of the gas tank. \n\n#### Example:\n```\nThe second question: \"What if the machine is pumping gas into a tank?\"\n\n```\nThe only thing we have to change for this question is to add the extra one for the gas pump; the gas pump is holding an extra 100, so that means that the gas tank holds 5000000-5000=4950000 gallons. We can solve for \"T\" and \"C\" (total cost) in order to answer the question. We have the total volume, so we can use the equation V=4950800 x 625 to get the cost of the gasoline. (T)  Since we know this question is asking how much it would be to fill the tank, we have to find the total cost (T)\n\n`Total Cost = Tank Capacity x Tank Price * The Number Of Liters That Are Used`\n\nWe know (T)=49,508,000\n  Now we can solve for (T).  We know we can assume for A, T=50 and B, T=60, so now we can figure out for C. C=(T=45).  We need to divide our equation 49508,048,065 by 625 and find our answer: 803,080.\n\nThe total cost of the gas would be $803,000.", "answer": " 16000"}

{"text": "There are a lot of ways to solve this problem. One possibility is to do it the way Tina originally wanted to.  Tina figures out how long it takes to clean one key, then does that to clean the remaining keys.\n\nThe above is a common and useful problem solving method called the Bottom-up method.  I personally used this method and thought it was a pretty good method because it is efficient, requires one to know how to subtract, and makes use of one's resources to find an immediate solution.\n\nI did notice this method had a problem, though.  It takes longer to add one to the remaining keys instead of multiplying remaining keys, like Tina did.  It is a good idea to see if there is a more efficient way to do things, even if it seems unnecessary at first.\n\n### Improvement:\n\nI realized I could calculate how long it would take to clean the remaining keys first and then subtract the amount of time it took to clean my first key.  Here is the formula I made to do that.\n\n$$\n(5.30 - time_1 + time_2) = time_3\n$$\n\nTime 1 is the total amount of time it takes to clean one of the 15 keys Tina is using in her formula, time 2 is the remaining time to clean the 14 remaining keys, and time 3 is the amount of time Tina needs after subtracting the time for 14 remaining cleanings.\n\nI am going to solve this problem using this way:\n\nTime to clean one key = 3 minutes / 5.30 minutes = 0.55\n\nTime to clean 15 keys = 0.54 + 0.53 + 0.52 + 0.51 +0.50 + 0.49 = 3.01\n\n-0.49 = amount of time remaining\n\nNow let's simplify:\n\n301 - 49 = 252\n\n$252 - 3 = 249$\n\nI can now subtract 3 minutes from the 252 to get 249 and then subtracting 3 leaves me with 246. This equation shows that I have 246 minutes to finish my homework.", "answer": " 52"}

{"text": "2 feet\n\n### Reason:\n\nFlagpole is 12, not 14 Feet\n\n### Explanation:\nWhen we cut the number down by 2, that's 1/6th of the 12 from \"from the base, in feet.\" So, we divide 5 by 8 (12/2 = 6). The whole number will be the remainder, and the quotient will be what we subtract from 5 to find how many whole numbers that are less than the whole number we need to find. This is why we needed to find that the number on the right will have to be a multiple of 12-6. Divide 6 by 12 to get 1/2, 2 will go in the quotient spot, and then 6 will go into 5. If 6 goes into 5 exactly without a remainder, then 2 will go into 5 as well, which means our answer is 2, but if the remainder goes into 5, then the answer is the quotient from dividing 6 into 5. 2 went into 5, leaving 1, because 6/5 = 3/2 - 3/2 = 1/6 or 1/3. So, for every 3 feet (6/2 = 3), we'll need 1 (1/3).\n\n### Input 2:\n\nThe sum of all three consecutive numbers is 155.

{"text": "720\n\n### Explanation:\nThe original movie was 2 hours long, hence we need 60% more time (extra 1 hr.), which equals 120 minutes, and it is 1 hour per time, therefore it equals 120 x 2 = 240 and because it cost 2 times more per minute, since the cost is per minute, and therefore multiply it by 240 and it equals 480 dollars. You would not necessarily say that 120 x2 is multiplied by 2 times to get 480, but it is, since x means multiply, therefor when you do that you have to multiply x(x=120) by x(x=2) which equals 2 times 120 = 240, then you can cancel out the 120 and you are left with 2 times 240 and thus it equals 48 times 240. The above process is very simple, and it is how you derive the answer, but I can show you an easier way.\n\nWhat is the value of $x in $60% of 2 hours =?  $60% is equivalent to 60/100=60%=0.6 = 0. 6  = 0.6 x 1hour = 0.6 hrs= 60mins so the remaining part is 60mins: 0.6 h = 60mins, which is 480 minutes.  Now because it cost $50 per hour, this does not change at all when it comes to 60 minutes, which means that 2 hours cost is 120x50=600 dollars, when it needs to be divided by the 600 divide by 3, which equals 200 mins (600)/3 = 200.\n\nThus the answer is 200x240=4800 dollars, and this can be further simplified into 4800/1.06 for taxes = $4500 dollars.\n\n### Extra 1:\n\n#### Explanation:\nI have answered your first problem, and it was pretty much as you described it, since it", "answer": " 1920"}

{"text": "The total number of flowers that bloom because of the trip is equal to the square root of the following quantity. This quantity is equal to the number of unicorns (6 * 2003).\n\n### Justification:The total number of steps each unicorn takes is equal to the total number of steps of the six unicorns multiplied by the side of the trip. Let the length of each unicorn step equal one meter. Everyone moves at the same time in this passage and the only obstacle they face is that of flowers. Each flower that they step on they cause to bloom. Because there are six unicorn, it follows that six flowers will bloom with every one meter a unicorn moves. Every unicorn stepping on a flower causes four flowers to bloom. Since the number of unicron is equal to the number six (6 * 2 * 200 * 1003), it follows that the number of flowers (5 or 7, depending on our initial assumptions) that bloom because of this walk is equal to either the square root of (2 * 2) or the square root of (3 * 3).\n\n## Expert\nThe total of flowers that bloom in the course of this walk is six times the square root of the product of the number of unicorns that went on the walk and the number of unicrons moving.\n\n#### Solution\n\nThe total number of flowers bloomed in the enchanted wood because of the walk of the six unicorns is equal to the product of the length of the journey and the total number of steps taken by all unicorns. The total number of steps taken is equal to the number 6 * 1 * 89, which is equal to 6 * 89. This quantity is equal the total number of steps to be taken. The product of 6 and 7 is equal to 5. Since the total of flowers to be bloomed is equal to the product 5, it follows that the total of flowers to bloomed is equal to 5, a fact that we will verify shortly.\n\n### Explanation of the above step\nThe total length of the journey made by each unicorn is equal to one kilometer. The total number of unicorn steps is equal to the number seven multiplied by 89.", "answer": " 72000"}

Since the distance covered is at-least 244 miles, you then have 3 routes you can travel the given distance: \n\n- By car: The time required for a drive is usually calculated by multiplying the number of miles to the speed rate in miles per hour.

Given an air plane flies at a rate of 500 miles/hr you will be able to travel the required distance in 1 hour 59 minutes.\n- By ship or boat: The time for a boat ride (depends on whether it is an inland waterways boat or offshore ship), is calculated in hours and at-least 50 hours is the approximate travel time for the journey.

The more tickets purchased, the higher the odds of drawing the ticket. You determine the odds by multiplying the number of tickets of each color that are drawn and then dividing by the total number of tickets sold. Black people purchase a disproportionately more number of lottery tickets than any other race. Let's say, 30% of black people own a lottery ticket and 98% of white people own a lottery game. If we use the previous lottery number example, we would determine the odds like this:\n\n30% of black ticket holders x 98% white ticket holders 1000 tickets x 7109 tickets = 3:1,230:1 and the ratio of the black:white tickets is 9:898. 3:1,988 times more. \n\nIf you have more odds, the lower is their probability of the event.

It\u2019s pretty obvious what we\u2019re trying to say here and by using that logic we\u2019ve been able to prove that he needs all his quota in order to meet that. \n\nHow was this done?

The number of all people invited is equal to 4 times the remaining invitations minus the number of people from the sports club.

The invitations attendance is exactly twice as many people from the sports club as the remaining invitations after dividing them by 100. What is the total invitations?\n\n### Solution2:\nWhat do I need to find out to complete the task? I need to know how many people does Martin invited from the sports club! I was able to get to this: Martin invited twice as the number of people form theirs sports club so the answer should be the number from his sports club divided by 2. So the remainder is 4, that is why the number of invitations is half. And the remaining invitations represents 20% of all invitations, divided by 12 comes to about 167.\nSolution: So, Martin invited twice as many from his school as from his sports club. And also the parties attendance is exactly double the people from his sports club, and invitations total number is half the rest of 167 plus divide them by 10 gives me an answer of 1675 (167*10).", "answer": " 36"}

This was because\nI had to repeatedly refer back to the formula to solve the problem.\n\nThe formula is:\n```P(x) = (10000 - x) x 1.3 + 1000x```\n\nHere's the explanation:\n```(10000-) = 1000```\nWe have 1000 less of the amount to buy, so instead we need 1000 units to be bought. \n```((10000 x 1.3) - x) = 154.699999987```\n10000 was initially our target amount to purchase, but we bought 1000 more in order to get the 30% discout.  The 1.3 can be seen as the 30% and subtracting it from 1000 gives us 700. \nThe number of ping pong balls we buy comes from having 1000(the amount we bought before the discount) - x(the amount we bought with the discount).\nWe can also use the following expression to find out how much each unit cost:\n```((10x) - x) =.139999971 -1```\n\nIn my solution, I used this formula to get the discounted price for a number of units.

{"text": "The answer to this question is: 12 square inches\n### Explanation:\n\nThe perimeter of the rectangle is equal to the length of its side. This is because the perimeter is found by adding the length of the side.\n\nArea of a rectangle is the size of the rectangle and its length (x) is 4 inches. This means the area of this rectangle is 4x4 = 16 square inches\n. \nIn other words, (length x length) = area of the rectangle.\n\nThe perimeter is 32 so 32 = 4 + 4 + 4. Therefore 4 is the length of 1 side of the rectangle\nThere are a total of 4 sides, because there are 4 sides to the rectangle that creates the rectangle's total perimeter.\n\nIts perimeter, 4, is therefore the length of 1 of the sides of the rectangle.\nTherefore area of rectangle is length x length\nArea of the 4 + 4 =2 square inches\n\nArea of rectangle is therefore 16 square inches plus 2 square inches.\nArea of rectangle is hence: 18 square inches.\n\n\n\n### Conceptual Links:\n\n[Grade 3 Concepts](http://www.schools.nyc.gov/Academics/Curriculum/Subject_Specific_Resources/mathematics/grade-3-and-4-mathematics/grade4/grade-4-concepts.aspx)\n[Grade 4 Mathematics](http://www.nyc.gov:8000/nycschools/getattachment/Instructional-Resources/Academics/Instructional-Framework/Curriculum-Guidelines/Grades-3-%26-4-Mathematics-Standards/Pre-kindergarten-through-Grade-12-Core-Curriculum-and-Instruction/Grade-4/Grade-4-Mathematical-Practices.aspx)\n[Problem-Solving Skills: Developing Disciplined Minds](http://www.math-problem-solving-skills.com/problem.html)\n\n### Additional Questions:\n1.

The rest of the numbers we need we can work out by just dividing the ratio numbers.\n\n10 is the number of dogs and 17 is the number of cats.\n\n10 divided by 17 is 0.588\n\nthen a multiple is used, this is simply used to solve fractions, we multiply the fraction by the number equal to the number we want to multiply by. The easiest way to do this is to turn that fraction into a percentage, then find a % that is half of the number of the question.\n\nthen % times 189 is.96725\n\nthen % times.9672 is 94.3%\n\nthen 189 x 94.3 is 178.4\n\nthe next bit is simple, the dogs that are divided off the 10 dogs are 21 dogs, and we can use the percentage to find out how many dogs are left once these 10 dogs are taken away.\n\nthen % x 178.3 is 92.5 %\n\nthen 21 x 92.5 is 1930\n\nthis is the exact amount of cats that Janet gets.\n\nIt could be worked out in many different ways but this is just a solution that i found that is not necessarily the right answer but seems like the simplest out of all the rest, it includes some math and using ratios, the use of ratios to work out the numbers and then dividing by the number to get the answer.", "answer": " 60"}

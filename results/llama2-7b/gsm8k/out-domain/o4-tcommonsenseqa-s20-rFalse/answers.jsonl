{"text": "Answer: 2 \n\nInput:There was an accident and the gas tank on the car had been leaking. The owner of the car immediately took it for repairs to the car repair shop and asked them to repair only a few parts of the car and keep the parts that had been removed safe. The dealership didn\u2019t need the parts back, and they wanted the owner to store them somewhere until the owner decided whether or not he wanted to spend the money for their repairs. But the owner didn\u2019t want to store them in his garage because it was small and already occupied. But even worse, his house was tiny and didn\u2019t have a garage, and he didn\u2019t want to rent a storage facility because they were cheap and the owner hated paying for things. So he decided to store them in his living room instead. But by the time he got home, all he had time to do between working a 60-hour work week, studying at night to advance his career in the field he\u2019d always dreamed of doing, and helping his parents with finances, exercise, and health inspections to keep their government benefits, he was barely able to keep up with those basic needs. So he decided to just put them into a cupboard in his living room, which left barely enough room for them anyway and was crowded as it was already with toys and the food necessary to survive when they had to spend money to buy groceries instead of having the means. But the owner still had a couple of hours until he had to go to bed early after a long and exhausting day, so he decided to go for a walk in the woods. Because of the leaking gas tank, he decided to have a cigarette and also thought that going for a few mile walk might help clear his head of the thoughts of renting a garage, paying more for the repairs, and maybe even getting help when in the future he found himself in more difficulties than before when he went out of the house. There were a lot of options, he thought. The walk was really refreshing and helped him think about what to do. He walked until he found he was at the same point as where he started the walk and it suddenly dawned on him that he needed more distance than what he was walking at that time so he began walking again in the darkness. He then decided that he was tired and wanted to sit down and have", "answer": " 10"}

We did this by drawing a diagram, and\nthen noting the number of digits of the number that appeared in the diagram\n- every odd digit, and in the case of 40 - 30, every even digit (which would not\nappear in the diagram).\n\nIt is easy to explain each of these numbers (well, 9 is easy, 40 - 9 is more\ndifficult).\n\nI suggest that, rather than drawing a diagram, you first try to write down a\nnumber in binary. To do this, you can draw a table like this:\n\n     0\n     |\n    1\n     |\n    010\n     |\n*********|***********\n*******  ** *******\n     *      *      *\n*********  ** ***********\n      /\n\nYou start at the very far left, and add a column, then a new line that joins\nit to its right. This becomes the next step in computing the binary number.\n\nSo, the binary number for 2 is this:\n\n      ***\n     |\n     0\n      |\n    0\n      |\n   000\n      |\n**********\n*******   **\n     *        * \n**********   **   ***\n     0       0     0\n      |    |    ___ _\n    0     0  0     0\n     \nThe very far right numbers are 1s. This makes use of the fact that in binary,\neach 1 is worth two in base 10. In the very far left, we have no 1s, so this\nnumbers is therefore zero.\n\nNext, we do the same thing, but in reverse. We go from 1 to the left, then\nstart again. Notice that the 1 on the very far left of 10 is to the left of\nthe 0 on the far right. This is useful, and we will use it later too.

The grade of your code will be given by me without bias and I will help you for this purpose by providing several grades of code (written in C++) that you can compare to your own. You should solve and grade your own code because it will give you the experience of writing a grade program and understanding the different grades of code.\n\n## How to use:\n\n>\nClone the Repo and open the test folder. In it, you will find all the graded code. Run it in the command line under the name of the file (ie [grade-1.c][grade-1.cpp][grade-2.java]). It will run a test and grade your code.\nIf you want to grade your code and test it by writing your own (note that the following will be a grade program, it won't compile and won't run but serve as an example of an exercise on how to use your code grade), you can open the test folder and write a file named *[grade-3.c][grade-3.cpp][grade-4.java]*. Run it by typing grade-3.c in the command line. Remember to edit the source code with your grade code. \n\n### How to write your own Grade Java program:\n>\n\nIt will give you the grade obtained by running grade-3.c / grade-3.cpp in this case. The grade obtained by grade-4.java will be compared to the one obtained in grade-3 to give you the grade of your code. In other words, it will take the source code provided by you and compare it to the one provided by grade-3\n\n### How it works:\n>\nYour job is to write a grade program that takes your source code to grade them.

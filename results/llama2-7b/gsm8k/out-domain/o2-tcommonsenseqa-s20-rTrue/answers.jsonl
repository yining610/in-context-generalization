E.g. how long d. 90 mb take and what the total download time is.\n3) To find the answer, it's important to note that the data given tells us three things: d1 and d2 are two points on the download. e1 and f1 are the times between these two points. T1 is the duration given. In reality, T1 is the duration of the entire time the download took, but because that would provide us with too many parameters, we keep it constant and focus on d instead. We focus on d and e - T1, because time is needed to download data.\n4) Note down d1 and d2, as they are known.\n5) Focus on calculating e.\n- Because we want to calculate T1, we also need to calculate e1 and f1.\n6) Now let's use the known data and the values we calculated above.\n- We know that e1 = 60.\n- We also know that t1 = 147, where, in this context, we are considering the entire download. This is because our knowledge of d1 includes our knowledge of d1 as the 1st d.\n7) Now, we plug in the 60 (e1) into d1, and we have the download starting at 90.

On the other hand, the cost per can at the grocery shop is $6.00 for 12 cans, which is $0.50 per can.\n3) We can see that the bulk ware house is 3 times more costly than the grocery shop, and since there are 3 times the number of cans at the bulk ware house than the grocery store, the price difference per can is $0.75.\n4) In this question, the bulk warehouse has a price of $12.0 or $0.25 per case with 48 cans to purchase.\n5) The grocery store sells at $6.0, which is $0.50 for 12 cases with 12 cans to purchase. \n6) To find the difference per can, we calculate the total as 54 cans in the bulk ware house and 24 cans in the grocery store.\n7) So, the total cost of both the outlets for 54 cans is $12.8 (bulk warehouse's $12.0 and the grocery shop's $0.8).\n8) Divide both by 54 and subtract the bulk warehouse's cost from the grocery shops cost, we get the total cost of $6.5 for the grocery store versus $6.8 for the bulk warehouse\n9) Thus, the cost difference per can is $ 0.50.\nSo the final answers are Answer 1: (bulk ware house) 48 cans for $12.

{"text": "I know there are some advanced mathematics involved so I am going to try my absolute best but first let me explain what my strategy is. I will try to break down the question by looking at an overview of what is going on first. Then I will figure out each step of the math that I understand. Then I will make a guess of the total and come up with my answer!\n\nLet's start by looking at what's being asked. First of all, the three cats are sitting on a fence meowing at the same time, then 5 minutes goes by and we need to calculate how many meow the total is. So let's break this question down further by looking at the cat that meows the most. The first cat meows 3 times a minute. Now for the second cat, we know that the second cat meows twice as often at the first cat. So we can say that the 2nd cat mews 6 times a minute. And the 3rd cat meows at one third of the frequency of the second. So this third cat meows 2 times as frequently as the kitten. So if we subtract 2 from 6 then we get 4 times as frequently as the first. We can now state that the third cat meows at 4 times a minute. Ok now that we have each cats number of meows we can add them up to get the total number of meows.\n\nThere's a lot of math to do but I will try my best to show you what I am doing so I hope you follow along.\n\nFirst, let's start with first cat. There is a total of 6 times a minute or 3 times a minute and 2 times as quickly. Subtract the second cat and you'll arrive at 4 times more regularly than the first. Now we also need the third cat. Add 2 on top of 4 from the first cat. That means we have 2 4 times per minute. If we do some advanced Algebra then add up the numbers of meow's we have for the kittens. So far we can say that the first cat meows 9 times a minute, second cat meows 21 times a minute and the third meows 27 times a minute. Now we know the total but we have to find out for how long.\n\nWe will find out in the next part", "answer": " 55"}

{"text": "1. First, we need to determine what information we are given. We are told that Bush and Matt are brothers, that Bush is younger than Matt, and that Bush will be 1\n2. Let'S assume that, since he is younger, Matt is the oldest person in the family. He will also be 10 years older than Bush next year.\n3. To determine Matt's age, we can subtract 2 from his current age and add 10, which will give us his age when he is 30.\n4. If Matt is 28 years old this year, then he will be 30 the next year.\n5. However, after that, he is 10 years older, so when Matt is 10 years from then, he will be 50 years old. Now we know that when Matt is 15 years from now, he is 50 years old, which means he would then be 45.\n6. We also know Matt will be ten years from now, which means he would be 35\n7. From our assumptions, we also know that his brother is 12 years old and Matt is 45, this means that when Matt was 12, his brother was 23\n8. To determine Bush's age, we must subtract 4 from the sum of his current age and the number of years that have passed since Matt's birthday.\n9. The amount of years that have passed between Bush's birthday and Matt's birthday is one year.\n10. So, Matt's age 4 years ago when Bush was 8, we would take 8 and subtract 74 because that was 4 years ago. It will equal 12.\n11. Now we know that Bush's current age 12, Matt's current age 45 and he's been 4 years since Matt's birth day.\n12. We can write the equation:\n13.

The company paved a total of 4 mi and a little less than 2 mi on the 1st and 2nd day respectively, and then it is asked about how many barrels it will need for the third day.\n3. Let's first solve for the gravel.\n4. The truckloads of asphalts use equal amounts of 2 gravel bags with 5 times the barrels. This is equivalent to: gravel/pitch = 25/1 Therefore, total gravel needed = 4*25 = 100\n5. Given that 3 truckloads of asphyxia equal one mile paved, 4 is the answer for the gravel needed.\n6. Then we move onto the pitch.\n7. Each truckload uses two bags of pitch. However, this was given on the second day, which is less than one day left to finish the rest of the road. Let's use this information to solve the problem.\n8. The third day is less than one and so we have an unknown value.\n9. This means that for the pitch it is the inverse of a truckload.\n10.

This is the answer for the pitch needed.\n13. Putting these two equations together, we can get 4*100+5*20=156. This is the answer to the question.\nSo the equation is x + y = 156 where x is the number of bags of pitch that the road paving company need in order to finish its work on the third day, and y is the number of bays of gravel that the company need in order to complete its work.\nSo the final equation is 4*10(x)=156\nSo the final answer to the equation is 280.\nSo the final number of bays of pitch that the road", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "1) Let's approach this question from a real-world perspective. \n2) When buying food, it is typical to weigh the items such as apples and bananas. However, the question does not mention weights, so we will need to estimate the price for each item. \n3) Tony and Arnold are buying different quantities of each item since they paid different amounts. While they spend the same amount overall, Tony bought larger quantities of each item, which will affect the price per item. \n4) Arnold paid $5 for a dozen apples, which is equivalent to $50 per dozen (50 apples in a dozen). Tony paid $7 for two dozen apples, giving us a price of $35 per dozen for Tony. \n5) Arnold paid $50 for the 15-fruit order which we can convert into a bunch of 15 bananas (15*5=75 bananas). Finally, Tony paid $7 for the 6-fruit order, so we can get a bunch of 6 bananas (6*1.5=9 bananas). \n6) From the above, a bunch of bananas usually costs $7.29 or $3.65. \n7) As stated earlier, both Tony and Arnold spend $55 on their food, so a bunch of bananas costs about $3.65 in this scenario. \n8) That being said, the correct answer is D: $3.65 as the bunch bananas cost in this scenario\nSo the final answer if the D: $3.75\n\n---\n### Answer: 1.

When calculating, we need to work with a number that is divisible by 15, so the option that requires more than 15 would be a good answer choice since we're looking at the total amount of money after selling the water bottles.\n3.) However, we would still need to factor in any additional amount, so it's important to consider the amount of money that the reduced cost and the regular price is worth in total.\n4.) The reduced cost at $1.85 and regular price at $1.86, so the difference between them is $0.01. If we multiply the difference by the number of water bottles we have at $1.80, we get $0.18 or 18 cents.\n5.) If we now add $2 which is the cost of the water bottle, and the $0.18 which we get from the difference between the reduced cost and the original cost, we get back the original $1.85.\n6.) Therefore, the total amount of money we need after selling the waterbottles at $1.87 is not $1.84 as required by choice D, but rather $1.85, which is the original cost.\nSo choice A is closest to $1.86.\n\nInput: How many of the following have a 2 for their 1st character/symbol, a 3 for their 2nd character/symbol, and so on as their character/number increases.

Since she needs to pit 3 pounds, that is 3*80, to get to that number, the first part would be 3*10, or 30 whole minutes.\n4) For the second part, the total number of pits Veronica needs is 80*3, so it would take 80 minutes to do those, because it would take 10 minutes to do 30 pits, then 10 minutes to count and arrange them into a pound, then 10 more minutes to get the desired 3 pounds or 240 cherries. \n5) All that added together, Veronica would need 3+90=93 minutes.\nSo the final time it would take Veronica to pit 3 pounds of pears is 93 minutes.

It is asked to fill in the space for the total amount of money made by Harry in a week, not the total amount of money that is given to him each day.\n3. The word \"earns\" is plural, which is why more than 1 dollar is used in the answer, not 5 dollars.\n4. The question mentions that he walks 9 and 7 dogs, which is less than the amount of dogs he walks on Tuesday, so option A will not work.\n5. Option C can't work either, because Harry is a professional dog- walker and is paid to do this job, so the question is not asking the total amount that he is paid in a week.\n6. Option D is the correct answer.  Harry walks 12 and 9 dogs on two days of the week.  It is the number of dollars that equals the total amount of money he earns in a week, not including the money that he walks on Monday.  A total of 21 dogs in this week walk equal dollar amount that Harry walks for a total of 48 days in a week.  Therefore, the answer is D: $48.\nSo the final answers are D: $48\n\nInput: 1.

First, we are given the total number of households, which is 50.\n2. We are also given information about the number of dogs and cats owned by each type of household, as follows:\n 2 dogs: 15 families \n 1 dog: 20 families \n 2 cats: remaining families\n3. Now, we can deduce the total number of dogs by using this information, given that each household has only 2 cats:\n     15*2 = 30 \n     20*1 + (50-30-2)*2 \n     50-30 + 50-30 = 160 \n   Number of dogs = 20 \n4. We can similarly deduct the total number of cats by using the information that each household has 2 cats, given that some households also have two dogs:\n     50-160 + 50 = 150 \n     2*50-2*160 = 15 \n   Number of cats = 17\n5.

As this is a question of comparative math, it is important to focus on the difference in each amount and how the differences relate to each other. \n2) Let's first determine the distance between Velma and Veronica, which we can get by subtracting Veronica's flash light from Velma's (Velma's flashlight - Veronica's flashlicht). \n3) To further determine the difference, we need the values of the flashlights of Veronica and Velma. From the information given, Veronica's flash can be seen with a distance of one-third the distance from Velma's, and Velma'sp flashlight is 2000 below that of Veronica, which is 4333. \n4) We now know that the distance between Veronica's and Veronica's is 5.9(because it is 5000 less than the distance Veronica to Velma). \n5) Comparing the value of the Veronica flashlights to the Velma flashlights, the velocity of Veronica's is seen at 2 and a ninth. \n6) The velocity of the Veronica's flash was 1000 compared to Velma's.

To calculate the needed fencing, we must multiply the length of the flowerbed by the shorter side of the triangle plus the shorter side of the flowerbed. In this case, 4 meters multiplied by 1 meter is 4 meters.\n6. The other side of the triangle will be determined by the width, which we know is 4 meters. The calculation then becomes 4 meters times 1 meter which equals 4 meters, which means we must multiply 4 meters by 5 meters instead of 4 meters by 4 meters,  and the total calculated fence needed would then be 20 meters.\n7.

Then given the fact that  Andy is a lawyer, we know the probability of winning for Andy is 100%. \n2. We are asked to compare the probability of winning both of them to the probability of losing both. This means that we will be comparing the probability of winning both as a fraction of a winning case with the probability of losing both as a fraction of the losing case. \n3. In probability, the multiplication rule states that we take the number of possible outcomes of the event where it succeeds, multiply it by the probability of it succeeding. From here, we have the probability of winning the first lawsuit given that it succeeds. \n4. Similarly, we multiply the second one with the probability of it succeeds because we are comparing it to the other and we multiply those two to compare the two outcomes. \n5. Therefore, the equation looks as follows. \n\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\np_1 (5000/100*100) &= 50/5 \\\\ \np_2 (100000/150*1000) &= 32/15 \\\\\np_3 (5000000 / 200*50000) &=\n\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n6.

Based on the information given in the question, we know that Tom needs 500 lbs of flour (50 bags of 10 lbs each) and 5 lbs of salt, which equals a total of 505 lbs of materials. We also know that 505 lds of materials costs $1000 + ($500 * 505 / 50) + $50 $ 1050.

We know that Tom spent $1000 on promoting everything and 500 tickes were sold, so the total cost of promotiing everything and selling tickies is $1000+$20 * 500=$3000 dollars.  In order to make money, Tom's total cost must be less than or equal to his total revenue.  So, the total revenue is $1650 (500 tickets * $35-$1000) = $1650.

{"text": "1) If t = total tins collected on any day of the week and x = total tins collected in the week, then: t = x (after 5th day) and t = 500(before 5th day) 2) First let's get our daily totals in the form t = 5*k. 3) Since t = x, x = 5*k and 5*k = 500, so 5 = 500/k. 4) Thus, k = 100 (since x = 500 and x = \u2211(t) for x days, x = \u2211(\u2211t)) 5) Since t = 50 + 5(x \u2013 x) = 500 + 5*95 \u2013 250, we put all numbers above into a simplified form and then simplify. (This is how I managed to get t = x on the 5th day.) 6) Sum of all numbers above = 500+95*5 = 50*105 = 50*(52) = 50*255 = 50(127.5). This is 50 x the sum of 105+253+253 = 500 sum of all days before the first day. 7) Thus t = x = 50*50 = 2500 total tinned tins collected in one week. \nSo the final answer we determined was 2500. Since t = x, we can put any value in for t. Since 500 = x and x = 250 x, we can then get x = 50 so we already know that James collects 50 cans in the first day to begin and then follows up that 50 with 3 times the number of cans = 150 the rest of the week.

{"text": "1)We note that there are two aspects to this question. The first is identifying the number of chairs \"there are 20 rows\". The second aspect in this question is the total number of people that will sit in the available chairs.  \n2)The answer to this question is not as simple as simply counting the number of chairs, because we need to account for how each chair can seat more than one person. We can calculate the total number of people who will sit in the chairs by considering the formula below.  \n`Number of people = (Chairs / Chairs Capacity) x Chairs Capacity` \n\nFor example, let's look at the number of people who would sit in a room with 5 chairs that can each accommodate 2 people. \n\nFirst, we calculate the chairs available by dividing the total number of available chairs by the chairs capacity \n\n`\n```\n5/2 = 2 ` \n```\n\nThen, we multiply the chairs available by the chairs capacity to get the number of people who will be seated in the chairs\n\n`\n```  \n\n2 x 2 = 4 \n```\n```\n\nFinally, we subtract the number of people that would sit to account for the number of chairs that are not available \n\n`\n\n```\n\n4 - 2 = 2\n```\n\nThus, we arrive at the final value of two people.\n\nThis formula can be used to find the number of people who sit in a room with any number of chairs available and any number of chairs capacity. \n\nFor example\n\n`\n\n12 chairs / 2 chairs capacity \u2248 6 chairs \n\nCalculation\n\n```\n\n(12 / 2) x 2 = 6 \n```\n\n6 - 2 = 4 people\n\nIn the example above, we can see how this formula is able to reflect the number of people who are able to be seated. Let's look at a more elaborate example to get a better understanding of it's application.\n\nCalculation\n```\n\n8 rows of 5 chairs =>\n(8 / 5) x 5 = 8 x 5 \n```\n\nIn the above example, there is a clear pattern", "answer": " 600"}

We know that 1 box contains 11 bolts, so we start by getting that variable; we know that B is 7, so we have B = 7.\n4. We then know that 1 box of nuts contains 15 nuts; so we know that 1 box is equal to 15; however, we already know it's 15; so we know that n is equal to 1.\n5. Now, we can write out, 7B = 7(7)/7 = 63.\n6. We know 1B = 11, so we know that B = 11/7. So, we can now write out, 63/7 = 9.\n\n7. Now, we want to solve for P. What we do, is put 6.5 into equal and subtract it on both sides; we will obtain, 15P = 6.5.\n\n8. Next, what we do is divide both sides by 15; we will then obtain, B = P/15. We multiply both 7 (B) and 6.5 (P) by the same 15. We will obtain, (7)(15) = (6.5)(15)\n\n9. We then end up getting, 105 = 97.5\n\n10.

{"text": "1) To solve this problem, we need to solve the following two equations: 1) Katie's daughter = 12 + x (unknown) 2) Let us label Katie and Lavinia as A and B 2) We can then set up the following equation: Katie = x - B x - A We are given that x - A = 10. Katie can be replaced with x - A. Therefore, we can rewrite the first equation as: x - A =  - B + 12 x - (x - B) = 12 x - x = 12 or x = 14. 3) To work with this equation, we will have to make more assumptions that we will prove false later. 4) One of Katie's children has the name of Lavinia's daughters. If we assume that Lavinia has a daughter named Lavinia and Katie has a daughter named Katie, then we can write two more equations: 5) Katie = B - A (A = Katie and B = Lavinia) 6) Lavinia = A - B (B = Lavinia and A = Katie) 7) This is enough to allow us to rearrange the initial equation to find the age difference: 8) x - 4 =  - 3 (A = 4 - B) 9) We can write the simplified equation as: x - 4 = -3 x + 3 =  -3, or x = 3 Therefore, Lavinia's son is three years older than Lavinia's daughter, and Lavinia's age is 4 times Katie's age. 10) The final answer is therefore A: 3 and B: 4.\nSo the final answers are A: 3 & B: 4\n\nInput: Who do you prefer, Mary or Ann?

The apostrophe on \"s\" would indicate that it's a contraction, not the answer to the math question.\n2- A: Burn hot can be applied here, but since it states \"3/4's temperature\", it would mean subtract 3/4 of the temperature, not multiply by it. Also, since temperature is hot, there already needs to be a degree mentioned in order to convert to what temperature it should be. Therefore, the answer cannot be A.\n3- B: This is the correct answer. 3/4*84 would equal 63.75, which is incorrect.

Sentence A uses \"on time\" whereas sentence B, uses \"late\". The use of prepositions is an important grammatical distinction that will affect the meaning of the sentences. \nSentence C uses \"I arrived first\", it means that \"I\" is earlier than \"she\". This use of \"first\" is grammatically incorrect as \"first\" is usually used with \"next\" to refer to chronological order or sequence. Also, since \"she\" arrives afterwards, it seems more appropriate to use \"last\" than \"first\". Another point is the use of pronouns \"she\" and \"I\", which may be confusing.\nSentence D uses \"late\" for the bus arrival. This use of pronouns may also be confusing, as it is not clear who arrived late, \"she\" or \"the bus\", and is thus, incorrect.\nSentence E uses \"late\". In this sentence, the order is reversed as \"late\" means \"I arrived late\" or \"I arrived after it\".\nHowever, the sentences both have the same syntax with a verbal (arrived) and subject (the bus, I) following an infinitive (arrived on time, arrived late).\nThe answer is option A and B.", "answer": " 112"}

If 90 years ago the father's height was half of his age, what is the age of his son?\nOutput: This is not easy to grasp at first glance, but it is a very standard equation. The trick is to rearrange the statement. 90 years ago, the father's age = 1/2 of his height. We know his height, but we don't know his age. So, we rearrange it so that we have the age in terms of height. 1/2 of 90 = age. Age = (90/2) or just 45. 45 years ago, the father was half his age.\nThen half of that is half of the son's age. Let's say the age of the father = f.\nThen the son's age = 45 minus f (since f is half) = 45 - (45/2) = 45-22.5 = 22.5 years.\nFinally, the answer is 22.5.\n\nInput : Why is the grass green?\nOutput:  There are several reasons why grass is green.\n1.

You use the ratios you have been given about the flowers and apply them to a simple rationale to determine how many flowers the given garden has.\n\n4. Start by solving for the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers on hand. This will help you get a clear picture of how Mark's colors are distributed in each category.\n5. The 10 yellow flowers are a part of a total of 500 flowers in his garden.\n  That means there are 10 yellow flowers for every 50, or every 5 of those flowers are yellow.\n  Since there are 100 fewer yellow flowers than purple flowers, 10 is multiplied by 5, so the purple flowers are 1 times as many as the yellow flowers.\n\n6. This is where you find out how many purple flowers there are.\n  10 x 5 = 50 purple flowers\n\n7. Now, we can multiply the number of purple flowers by the ratio of purple color flowers vs green color flowers. That will give you the purple component of the garden's flowers.\n8. (50 - purple flowers) x 25% = 40% of green flowers\n9. You can also break this down by adding up these values numerically:\n100 - 50 = 50, then multiply 100 x 25%\n10. The green flowers are 25% of the available flowers, so you simply multiply total purple flowers by 25% to determine the total green component.\n\n11. 50 x 0.40 = 20 green flowers\n\n12. Finally, all you have to do is sum all three quantities to get the final value for the total number of flowers in Mark's garden\n\n13. 50 + 50 + 20 = 120 flowers in Mark's Garden.\n\nSo the final answer to the question:", "answer": " 35"}

To answer this, we need to remember that \u03c0 is a constant and therefore we will always find that the area of a circle will always be a number whose decimal part is always going to be approximated by pi. So the best value of pi is that one whose number of decimal places equals the number of decimal places in the circle\u2019s area that are the ones which keep on rounding.\n4.

{"text": "1- How do you solve the Bear Puzzle?\n2- There are several potential methods for solving this particular Bear Puzzle. One way to approach the problem is to try to come up with a formula that relates the total weight needed to gain, the total weight gained, and the percentage of the weights attributed to different types of food.\n3- Let's work through a process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities. We can eliminate option A because a formula must include all of the information given in the question, such as the number of pounds needed to gain and the percentage of the weight attributed to different types of feed.\n4- We can also eliminate option B because it does not include any of the information provided in the question, such the number of pounds needed and the percentage of feed used. \n5- We can eliminate option C because it lacks one or more required items, such as the percentage of feed or the number of pounds needed.\n6- To summarize we are left with Option D & E, option D is the correct answer. If you think about the bear trying to gain the required amount of pounds, you realize that you need a way to calculate the difference. If the bear needed 1000 lb in total, and each item was the same percentage of his diet, he'd have eaten the same number of salmon. His salmon intake probably increased a bit, but the bears increased weight probably came from other sources like small animals, which we can assume came from the number of berries eaten.\n7- The bear probably gained 327 lb from small animals from the percentage of 20% of the weight it needed to gain.\nSo the final amount is 327\n900-327=573\nSo the final answer would be 573\n\nInput: What is 28 squared?

Since Jeff gets tired in the last round, we will calculate the rounds in which he does not get tired.\n3. We will assume that Sam and Jeff each skipped 20 times during the competition, if it was Jeff's turn.\n4. If Jeff skipped 1 more time than Sam in the first round, and Jeff skipped 3 less times than Sam in the 2nd round, this means Jeff skipped 1 times in the 3rd round, assuming Jeff only skipped during the rounds he did not get tired.\n5. This means Jeff skipped (1+3-1) times each round that he did not get tired, or on average 2 times per round in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th rounds.\n6. Therefore, Jeff would average 16 jumps per round (since Sam averaged 16 times per round and Jeff averaged 2 times)\n7.

This same algorithm has been perfected to the point where it can do the division with equal accuracy both with small and large numbers. The algorithm for long division starts off with a guess for the remainder, like so: 64/8 = 8; but it also needs a divisor, which it gets by dividing 8 by 2 and 2 by the remainder of the previous calculation, in this case 12/2 = 6. So it gets a new guess of the remainder of: 64/12 = 4 or 6. It now divides 12 and 8 by the guess, 4, and subtracts the result. The result gives it a new remainder, 84/12. After that, it gets a new guess and repeats this process. The final answer is written in the bottom line, which is exactly why we know it works for larger numbers: 84/8 = 10, but the computer can\u2019t know that. Instead it simply ends up with an answer that fits perfectly into the result from the previous step.\n Output: 1)The first step is an algorithm that you can use in any programming language that will give you an exact answer. You can start with a number, do some long division, and get the remainder and the quotient at the same time. You can then run through the algorithm several times to get the answer to any number of decimal places that you want. 2) When I give you an answer to a long division problem, I can tell you exactly how many calculations I ran before I got to my answer.

The speed is in miles per minute, so we divide the distance traveled (55 miles) by the time the bus travels (2 minutes = 120 seconds):\n5. Next, add 10 miles which the driver has to travel to reach the starting point by an alternate route:\n6. The speed is still in miles per minute, but we need to multiply it by two because we are calculating how long it would take to start off in one direction by taking the alternate route and then change. So the new speed is now in miles per minute:\n7. Since we have determined how long it will take the bus to travel 65 miles in a normal way, we do the same for the 10 additional miles traveled on the altered route:\n8. The bus can travel as fast as 5.5 miles in a minute on an altered route, which is slightly faster than on the normal route:\n9.

{"text": "1: The statement of the problem is that a rectangular plot of private land has fencing around it. One short side of this fence needs to be replaced due to rust. The long sides are three times the length as the short side.\n2: The wording of the question can help to guide you as to what type of answer is needed. Specifically, the question asks how many feet of fencing needs to be replaced.\n3: To determine this, you can start by thinking about what is happening with the fencing. One of the short sides of the fence is being replaced, which is one side of the fence. Therefore, the remaining fencing is three times the length of one of the other sides. You can express this as 3x, where x is the length of the remaining fencing.\n4: One possible way to approach this would be to consider the length of the fencing that is being replaced, which will give you a shorter length (less than 640). Then, you would subtract this from the total length of the fencing (640), to find the length of the remaining pieces of fencing. However, you can find this total length in the question with the given information about the dimensions of the property.\n5: One possible solution is (3x)-212 = -428. This will give you the length of the remaining sections of fencing.\n6: This solution can then be verified by adding up all the lengths of the fencing, which will equal 640, as given in the question.\n\nSo the final answer to the question would be: (3x)-2(212)-212, which can be solved to give 3x-2(212) = 141.6666667 ft.\n7. 141.", "answer": " 80"}

Well, since Barry's shoulder height is a smaller than his full height, it means he could reach 7 feet if he stood on 5 feet of something!And that's where Larry comes in!!Larry's height is 7 feet, so if Barry stood on Larry's shoulders at a height of 5 feet, then Barry's shoulders would be at a height of 6 feet.  So, if you add 5 feet to Barry (2 feet from full height and 3 feet from shoulder height), then you get 11 feet!Now, if you add the height of one barry (7 feet) on top of 11 feet, then you'll get 21 feet, as expected.So, the answer is 21 feet.\nSo the final answers is the answer is 2 ft, which means Barry can reach 16 ft, as Larry's shoulder height 5 ft -4 ft which is 1 ft.And Larry can reach 17 ft, as Barry's shoulder height 7 ft -6 ft which is 1 and Larry 7 ft.\nSo the final and answer is option D: 21 feet. \nSo the final and correct answer is option D:21 feet\n\nInput: A machine \nOutput:\n1.

{"text": "1) The first step is to calculate the total cost of purchasing all five puppies:\n2) Let's work through the calculations of the five puppies. First, we need to find the total cost of three puppies. We know that three puppies cost $150 each, so the total cost of three is $150 x 3 = $450. Next, we need to subtract the $450 total cost of three pups from the original $800 total cost: $800 - $450 = $350.\n3) The total cost to buy all seven puppies is $800, which includes the original $350, and the cost of the three discounted ones at $150 each = $270. Thus, the total cost of all seven puppies was $800 + $150 x3 = $830.\n4) Now that we know the total cost of all 7 puppies, we can calculate the two puppies that were not on sale:\n5) Let's start by subtracting the price of three puppies (discounted at 50%) from the total cost of 7 (which was $830). $830 - $455 = $375.\n6) We then subtract the original individual puppy cost (which was $150 x2 = $300) from $375, leaving $70 ($375 - $300) for the cost of the two puppies not marked down. Thus, each of the two other puppies costs $70 each.\nSo the final calculation is the total of $200 on sale + $70 each for the other two = $270 + $70 x 2 = $270+$140 = $410\n\nHINT: 1) Use a pen and paper to work through the 11 questions that follow in this work.\n2) The instructions on the 11 questions are as provided.\n3) Answer each question one by one.\n4) You are not expected to have 100% accuracy in answering or getting to the ultimate solution in the fewest number of steps.\n5) You are only", "answer": " 175"}

{"text": "13 + 26 = 39\n26 + (26/2) = 13\nHINT: The key to this problem is to find the sum. To do so, use the distributive property to remove the parentheses. This property says, you can distribute a number to multiple terms, and to each of its variables. For instance, in the sentence above, the (26/2), you would remove the parentheses using the distributive property and you would have,\n(26/2)(2) = 16 + 1 = 17, then (13 + 17) = 30, then (30/2) = 39.

{"text": "The questions asks for the minimum number of riding one should make in order to get the 30- day pass cheaper per ride than a one-way ticket.\n1. We can firstly consider three things: \n2. Given a one way ticket costs $2, 30 day pass costs $50, let's firstly think what will happen with the minimum required rides. For simplicity, we take the assumption that there are 30 rides in 30day.\n3. 30*(2) can be converted to 60, which implies 30 day passes are cheaper than 30 one way ticket.\n4. As a simple test, assuming you travel 15 days, the amount you need to pay is 210. This is the maximum amount and the minimum amount if they had been 300. We can see 210 is less than 200, which confirms the answer. \n5. For simplicity, let's say you travel 15 times a month. We can calculate 15*(2) 30 (30)\n6. If you ride the 30 day pass, the cost is 150, which is cheaper than 15*(2). As a test, with 10 riding, we spend $150 and get 30 passes.

{"text": "1. A cheetah can run faster than a gazelle. We can check the answer by plugging the numbers into the calculation provided. We get 23 seconds for A, 29 seconds for B, and 35 seconds for C.\n2. We can evaluate the options by considering the information we are given and the formulas we are using.\n3. If one mile per hour = 1.5 feet/s, then 1 mph = 1.5 ft/s.  \nThen we can write: d = vt.  When we add 210 ft to both sides, we get: 210ft + d = 210ft+vt. Subtracting 210ft from both sides, we get d=210(1.5/t).\n4. To get the cheetah to catch up to the gazelle, we are told that the animals have already been traveling in the same direction for some distance and that they are 210 feet away from each other. Let's take an example that we will use later on.\n5. If we plug t=3 in for our example, we get d=70.5. That means that the cheetah would need about 33.5 seconds to get closer to the gazelle by that much.\n6. We can do some calculation to confirm the results by setting t=3 and plugging it into the equation 210ft/0.085. That should return us 210(1/3)=3.6 min and not 3.8 min which is correct to within a 2-minute margin of error.\n7. Therefore we can conclude that the calculation for the cheetah catching up to the gazelle is correct after the first 210 feet they are traveling. We can calculate that by subtracting the original distance from the new distance. The distance to catch up is 129 ft from the original distance and the speed is 4.1 mph.\n8.

How many centimeters of light can travel in one second?\nOutput:1) To answer the question, first we need to find the time it takes for light to go through one centimeter.\n2) To find this time, we use the equation: d = s/c where d is the distance, s is the speed, and c is the speed of light.\n3) For this question, s = 300, 000 km/s and d = 1 cm, which gives us 1/300, \u00ad000 = 0.0033 seconds. \n4) Now, we can apply this time to another question or calculation. As an example, let's consider the height to which light travels during a 0.002-second period.

The length of the sides 2. The number of sides 3. The number of inches in a square side 4. The number of sides squared\nOutput: 1st Answer: If you want to find the side length, you need to add 25 inches to obtain a side length of 100 inches. 2nd Answer: If you want 8 sides, you need one big square with sides of 100. You need a square with sides of 25 to make it big. 3rd Answer: 25 is length of the square. It is used for a \"special\" rule when you cut or divide the sides to make a square. 4th Answer: It is the product of the number of sides and of the side.\nThe 1st and 2nd are the only viable solutions because every square must have integer width and height.\nThe width is always larger than the height, which means you need the side length (100) for a square with 8 right angles.\nYou use the \"special rule with sides of 20\" if you cut the rectangle into two smaller rectangles and stack the 8 rectangles without rotating.\n1st Answer is correct.\nSo the final solution should be 1.

{"text": "1) If you look at the wording and set of information given, two hearing aids were damaged, so the question assumes that he was wearing two hearing aids and had to repair them.\n2) So the question is how much did john personally pay for each replacement.\n3) The total cost would be $2500 per each.\n4) The hearing aid covered by insurance is 80%. (80/100) It is important to note that the insurance is per hearing aid, rather than for each pair, which is not mentioned in the question.\n5) Now, if we break down the information:\n\nFirst, the total cost for each hearing aid = $2500.\n\nSecond, the insurance covers 80% (100-80) of the hearing aid, which is (80/1) = $2000. As mentioned before, the insurance is for each hearing aid, which means that each insurance covers $2000, not a total of $4000.\n\nThird, (2500-2000) = the remaining amount that john needs to pay per each hearing aid, which equals to $500.\n6) So, the answer is:\n\n$500.\nSo the final  answer is $500.", "answer": " 1000"}

{"text": "1. The given question is a basic mathematical calculation related to the subject of fractions. However, the question is not a standard mathematical problem and does not require a specific method to solve.\n2. The challenge in this calculation may be to visualize the problem and keep track of the different fractions throughout.\n3. One way to approach this question is to first identify the fractions that are involved and calculate each one separately.\n4. The problem states that there are 36 seabirds on the roof of Taco Bell, 1/4 of which are scared away by throwing stones. If 1/4 denotes 8, then 28 remain.\n5. Subsequently, 1/3 of these remaining birds leave, and the remaining 1/2 (8/2 = 4) fly to McDonald' s parking lot.\n6. This creates a new scenario for calculating the fractional balance.\n7. One way to approach counting the total number of seagulls is to mentally break down the problem and consider how each fraction affects the final total.\n8. For example, one could divide each fraction into 8, and count the remainder after subtracting each fraction from 36.\n9. So, by calculating 1/4 = 4 + 2 + 1 + 0, 1/3 = 4 + 0, and 1/2 = 2 + 0, we have 36 seaguls left.\n10. Another approach is to write down the fractions associated with each situation and use basic addition and subtraction to work through the calculations.\n11. For example:\n12. 36 seabirds - 8 scared away by throwing rocks\n13. - (1/4 of 8) = 4\n14. - 4 = 28 birds left on the roof of Tacobell\n15. - 32 seabirds - (1/3 of remaining 28seabirds)\n16. - (1/3 * 8) = 0\n17. - 8 = 6 birds left\n18. 6 + 12 birds = 18 birds left\n19. 18 birds left/2=9 birds left\n20. So, the final answer is 9", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "1. Let x be the number of trash cans.\n2. There are a total of 12 trash cans, since the town paid 14 trashcan and paid 2x cans for each store.\n3.

The town paid for x trashcans, since -2x = 14.\nSo the final number is x = number of trash can paid for, 2x = all trash cans the town paid for. So x/2 of all trashcans were paid for by town.\nSo the final question is How many trash can has the town paid for answer = half the number of trashcans that is x\nSo the final answer for the question is town paid 12 trashcans", "answer": " 42"}

How many apples and oranges in one of the bags?\nOutput: Choices:  A. 12 oranges B. 13 oranges C. 19 apples D. 20 apples E. 22 oranges \n1. We can think about this question in two ways:\n2. 1. If you have 2 bags of 8 items each, and they contain 6 oranges and 13 apples, there would be 22+8= 30 apples in one bag, and 22+8 = 30 oranges in the other bag.\n3. By this method, we can determine that the answer is E: 22 oranges.\n4. However, an alternative method would be to do the following:\n5. 2. Since a total of 24 items were split equally between the two bags, each bag got 12 items.\n6. 3. The first bag contains 6 oranges and therefore 6/12 = 1/2 of the orange in one bag.\n7. 4. Similarly, the second bag would have 13/12 apples, and there would be 13 + 6 = 19 apples in one bag.\n8. 5. Therefore, the answer would be B: 19 apples.\n9. Since the choices contradict each other, the answer would be (A).\n10. So the final answer is A: 19 appels\n\nInput: A fruit salad consists of apples and oranges.

Now the price of the car is 15% more expensive. How much would Jane have to pay to buy a car now?\nOutput:1. We do not know when the price increased by 15%. We can say that Jane won the car a year ago and the price increased by 30%, we can say that the price is 125% more than the price when Jane won the car.\n2. Jane paid $20,000 for the car when she won it. In 1 year, the price has increased by 15% so the current price = 20,00 x 125\nand now the new price is 25000.\n3. Jane is now owed $3000\nAnd now we say the formula to find how much Jane would pay to buy the car now is \"x / 100\" where x is the original price.\n4. Jane would need to pay $15000 more than the current price in order to buy the car now, since Jane won the car for $20000 and now the price is $30000.\nSo now we plug in to get: $1500/$125 = $1200, so the answer is $1200.\n\nInput:A bus depot sold some tickets at 1.5x the price.

{"text": "1) In this question, we're given that there's a block of flats in the city that has 12 floos. \n2) The first thing to note is that the author states that half of the floors have only 5 apartments. This implies that the other half of the floors has only 6 apartments, which is consistent with a 6-6-6-6 arrangement, where the 6 and 6 floors are opposite sides of the block.\n3) From there, we can determine that the total number of floors equals the number of apartments. This means that we can calculate the total number of apartments as 12 and then divide that by 2, which gives us 6. Finally, we can deduce that there are probably at most 6 residents per apartment, and there are at least 5 apartments per floor.\n4) After combining these facts into an equation, we arrive at the final answer of E: at least 30 residents can live in the block of flats.\nSo the final  answer is E: at least 2\n\nInput: What size of truck is ideal for delivering large goods and items?

{"text": "1. The question asks for the value of how much Isabel has left after she spent half her money and bought two things. \n2. The answer can be found using basic arithmetic, including operations of subtraction and multiplication.\n3. The starting amount can be written as $51 after spending $25.50 (half of her money). This was because she spent $50, which required her to multiply the number of items by an operation of division by 2 (getting 2 dollars and 50 cents back). \n4. After buying the book, her remaining amount can be written as: \n5. After buying the toy, her remaining amount can then be written as: 6. To calculate the original amount, we need to subtract the toy's cost (2 dollars and 38 cents) with the cost of the book (3 dollars and 30 cents) and subtracting the sum of the two remaining amounts from the original amount of $51, which results in $8.20.

The question mentions three values in miles, which can be arranged in terms of additive inverse: 2 * 41.18 = 82.36, 369 - 2 * 42 = 316.14\n6. The subtraction of the additive inverses of 82.3 and 316.00: 82.3 - 316.4 = -234.1\n7.

In order to calculate the amount of money that Tom saves, we will use the cost-saving formula.\n3.) The cost-saving formula is used to find the net cost savings that a business or individual has when dealing with different pricing models.\n4.) Specifically, this formula takes into account any discounts or lower prices that are associated with these savings.\n\n5.) To apply this formula to our problem, we can substitute the given variables.\n6.) If we plug in a $200 cost for the normal doctor visit, then the average cost of the discount clinic becomes 30% lower, or $140.\n7.) This means that the total cost for one doctor's visit at a normal doctor is $200, while it is $140 at the discount clinic.\n8.) Since there are 2 visits needed for the discount clinic, with 1 visit using a normal doctor, the two visits equal $\n120 at the discount doctor and $400 at the normal doctor.\n9.) Therefore, the savings amount is simply the difference between the two prices, which means $280 minus $360, for a total of $280.\n10.) This represents the total cost savings that Tom will obtain by going to the discount clinic instead of a normal doctor.\n\nSo the final answer to this question is that: 280\n\nInput:What is 328 divided by 58?

{"text": "1. The question asks for the total mass of fruit produced in an orchard, taking into account the number of apple trees and the number of peach trees.\n2. We begin by observing that the orchard has 45 peach treats and 30 apple trees. From this, we can calculate the average production of peach trees to be 30/45 or 0.67 peach trees per fruit. This will enable us to calculate the average production of apples per tree based on the number of apples given for each tree.\n3. To calculate the total mass of fruit, we multiply the number of apples produced by each tree by the number of trees then add this together to get the total mass of apples. We do the same thing for the peach trees and add the total mass of fruit to get the total mass for the orchard.\n4. Therefore, the total mass of fruit in the orchard is 225 kg for the apples and 192.5 kg for the peaches, for a total of 417.5 kg of fruit.\nSo the final fruit is 417.8 kg\n\nInput: How many meters of wire is needed for the garden?

Johnny TV produces 220 in a year \n4. L&J produces 180 movies in a movie year.\n5. In a year Johnny TV produces 2 movies more than L&J.\n6. In five years together Johnny TV produces 70 more movies. In five years together L&J produces 90 movies.\n7. In 5 years the total is L&J 90 + Johnny 70 = 160. \n8. Total movies in 5 years is the sum of the annual production of each studio which equals 220 + 180 = 400  \n9. It appears that we found out that over five years they combined is 400 which is the same amount they produce per year so we did not multiply their production rate together.\n10. The total number of movies for the combined production of Johnny and L&J is 220 + the 160 = 380 movies per year for five years total.\n11. So the correct answer is 380 moviies\nSo the final answer for the question is 380\n\nInput:In which of the following years did the average price of gasoline in Canada increase more than the inflation rate?

(20x45=1000 1000/45=22.22 is 20% of what? 22.22/20=1.11)\nii.45 is 50% of what? (45x50=2250 2250/50=4.5)\ni.This indicates that 22.2% is the fraction that we want to subtract from 50% to have Lake Crystal's fraction.\nii.Hence, we add.0222 to 0.5 to get 3.352 as this is an equivalent fraction/percentage to 45. 45 is the portion of Lake Crystal, 3.35 is the portion of Lassie. \niii.So: 45x3.35 = 153.95 is the total number of frogs in both lakes.\nSo the final answers are 20% less than the original, so the original total is 50%\nSo the answer is 153.\n\nInput: Can you give me five pennies for a loaf of bread?

Let' grade math question be the question we are trying to solve.\n\n3. First, we can determine the total sales as 80. Then we can convert the proportion in the question to a decimal, getting 2.2 as the fraction (22/10). Next, we can find the total of the cash sales based on the question, yielding 32.5.\n4. Now, dividing these numbers and using decimal math, we can get 32.5 divided by 15.5 equals 2.1. This means the total amount of cash sales was 2.1 times the original amount, which is 16.6.\n\n5. Therefore, the correct answer is B: 16.6\nSo the final answer for The buyers who came to Brandon's shop and bought goods worth $8, if 2/5 of that sale was a credit sale and the rest was cah and by dividing these numbers and the remaining 5/9 will equal to the cash sale is 16.7cand in our question the last number is a 6 instead of a 7.\n\nInput: What do you mean by 'a man is known by the company he keep'?

{"text": "1 The scenario involves three people, Olga, Rick, and Hortense, all of whom have different amounts of stripes on their tennis shoes.\n2. We are being asked to determine the total number of stripes on the shoes of all three people combined.\n3. Since we know there are three people, we can start by writing the number of stripes for each person in a three-by-one matrix format, with the number of stripes in the first row being the number assigned to Olga, the second row being Rick's number, and the third row being Hortense's number, respectively.\n4. We are looking for an answer that accounts for the information provided in the scenario.  We know that there are three stripes on each of Olga's shoes, and we know that there are one fewer stripe than that on Rick's shoes.\n5. This can be written as \"Olga stripes - Rick stripes = Total stripes\".\n6. Similarly, we know that Hortense has twice as many stripes as Olga does on her shoes.  We can write this as \"Olga - Hortense = Total stripes\".  Putting all these relationships together, we can write out the mathematical formula as \"Olga strokes - Rick lines = Total strokes\".\n7. This equals two times the number of stripes that Hortense does.\n8. Finally, putting all of the information together, we can solve the problem by substituting the values, which results in \"Olga + Rick + Hortense = Total strokes\".  This simplifies to \"Total strokes = Olga + Rick + Horton\".\n9. Therefore, the combined number of strips on Olga's shoericks and Hortense's shoes is three plus one plus two times three (which is six).\n10.

To do this, we can subtract Mark's number of cans 0 from Jennifer's number of can 40 and divide 30 by the number of Mark's cans:\n5) We now know that there will be 6 cans of milk bought by Jennifer for every 5 can of milk Mark bought. \n6) It is clear to determine that Mark bought 1 can of 6 cans more than Jenifer, and that total number of cans of milk bought is 46 cans.\n7) To determine what number of cans did Jennifer bring home, start with Mark's number 50 cans of milk minus 5 cans Jennifer bought more for every 5 can Mark bought. It is important to remember that there will be 1 can of milk bought by Mark after 6 can of milk Mark bought more than 40 cans more than Jennifer bought, resulting in 1 can more of milk bought home by Mark and total number of cans brought home to be 46 cans of milk.\n8) And the final answer can be summarized as follows: if Mark bought 50 cans and each bought Jennifer 6 cans more for every 5 Mark bought, Jennifer brought 46 cans home.\nSo the final table is the:\n\n| Mark purchased | Jennifer | Jennifer brought home |\n| 0 cans |   40 cans |     46 cans |\n| 50 cans |   0 cans |     50 cans |\n| - - - - - - | - - - - | 46 cans |", "answer": " 100"}

We're told that the craft store makes a third, a quarter, and the rest of its sales in the three sections of fabric, jewellery and stationery respectively out of a total of 36 total sales a day.\n3.- Let's work out how many sales each section gets out of the total. Since the total is 36, and there are only three sections to choose from, then the total divided by the number of sections is given. In this case, the fabric section gets a third, which means it gets 12 out of 36, or 12/36.\n4.- The jewelry section gets three quarters, so for every three total sales there's one jewelry sale. Since there's 36 total, that's 36/3 times 1, or 12.\n5.- The rest of the sales, also known as the leftover sales are 3*36/3 = 12. Adding up the numbers, we get: 12 + 12 + 36 = 50. Since the question was to find the number of sales in the stationery section, 50 = 3*(12 + 1 + 12).\n6.- The numbers 1, 12, and 12 come from how many total sales there are, out of the amount that each section gets.

{"text": "1) The question asks how many hotel rooms a school principal needs to book to accommodate all students in a class.\n2) The principal needs to book 14 hotel rooms to accommodate all the students in the class because each bed in a hotel room can usually fit two people, and there are 30 students in the class. Each room contains two beds and a couch, and the couch can only fit one student. Altogether, there are 33 rooms in a hotel, so the principal has to book all of the rooms in the hotel. The number of students in the class, 30, is smaller than the capacity of the hotel rooms, which is 33, so the principal still has two unused rooms. If a couch were removed from the room and used to accommodate a third person, the class would fit in all of the rooms.\n3) Option A, the answer, is \"14\", which means that the principal only needs to book 1 room for the class to fit. The principal also has two unused rooms, which is correct because the couch can only accommodate 1 person, not 2.\n4) Option B, \"15\", is incorrect because the class would not fit the hotel's rooms. If all rooms were filled with 1 student (2 beds) and 2 students (1 room), there would be an additional class of 15 students left over and an extra room would still not be available.\n5) Option C, \"16\", is incorrect because the couch cannot accommodate for two full-sized people. If there were 16 students and 3 beds, the couch would only be able to accommodate one person.\n6) Option D, \"18\", is incorrect because the students would not fit in the hotel's rooms based off the same assumption in option B. The room would only have one couch in each room, which would not be enough to accommodate 17 students.\n7) Option E, \"16\", does not fit with the requirements.\n8) Option F, \"17\", is incorrect because if the principal only booked 17 rooms, there would still be an excess class of students and an unused room.\n9) Option G, \"19\", is incorrect because the extra room would not fit into the assumption of B or C.\n10)", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "This question can be solved by using the pigeonhole principle. To begin, create a three-column table: the first column is for \"Butcher\", the second column is \"Number of Packages\", and the third column is \"Total Weight\".\n1. Put all ground beef into the second column, and note that the total row adds up to 107, meaning that the three butchers delivered 10, 7, and 1 packages each.\n2. Put an x into the third column, where the beef delivered by a butcher was delivered.\n3. Look at the number of x you have in each column.\n4. If one column has an x in it, that means one butcher delivered the entire column. That is because if it wasn't one butcher delivering all the packages, that means all three butchers delivered equal quantities. This is a contradiction to what we know.\n5. There are 0 x in the total column. So that means two butchers delivered the entire column, which means the second butcher delivered 9, and the third butcher delivered 3 packages.\n6. So the solution is - 1 x= 9, -2 x= 3. Therefore, the third butcher delivered three packages.\nSo the final solution: - 1 x= = 9, -2 = 3.

{"text": "12.0354\n1. Given the problem, the question is how much Winnie was able to take home from her lottery prize after paying a 20% tax and a $5 processing fee.\n2. The first step in figuring out the answer is to calculate the total amount of the prize, including the tax and the fee, which will make it easier to determine how much Winnie is able to take home.\n3. First, we know that Winnie's prize amount is $50.\n4. To calculate the amount of the 20% tax, we can multiply $50 by 20% which gives us $10.\n5. Next, we add up the tax and the processing fee, which gives us a total of $10 + $5 = $15.\n6. Then, the last step is to subtract the amount of tax and processing fees from the total prize amount which gives us $50 - $15 = $35.\n7. From there, we multiply $35 by 100% to get $35 x 100% = $35. So, Winnie's total prize amount was $50.\n8. Then, we subtract the amount of the tax and processing fees, giving us $35 - $15 = $$20.\n9. Next, we multiply $20 by 50% to get $20 x 50% = $10. So, Winnle's prize amount net of taxes and processing fees is $20. Then, we multiply $2o by 0.5 to get 10%. Finally, we multiply $10 x 0.5 to $5.\n10.

In this case, we are told that the total cost of items was $100,000, and there were 2100 items sold, which means $500 was spent on each of the 2100 products sold.\n4. To get all of the numbers, we can take the total cost, do the division of the above number with the total number of products sold, and then to get them multiplied, we can just use the above number times the numbers of products to get the total revenue for today.\n5. $500 divided by 2100 = $0.2375\n6. This is the cost of each individual product. If we multiply $0.23 by the total cost, we get $500.00.\n7. We then have $500.237 x 20 = $5100.00\n8. Finally, we can take 5100 - 100 = 5000\n9.

To do this, we can rewrite the question in our own words as follows:How many red bouncy balls did Kathrine buy?How many yellow balls did she buy?How many more red bouncing balls did she buy than yellow?\n3. To answer the question, we must first determine how many of each color of bouncing ball were purchased by Kate.\n4. Therefore, let's assign a letter to each color of ball and place the amount of each in a second column.\n5. First, we will assign a letter to each type of ball and place the number of each that was purchased in a second column in order to solve the question.\n6. For red we will use R.\n7. For yellow we will use Y.\n8. For total of red we will use \n9. For total of yellow we will use\n10. Therefore, we can arrange it like this:\n11. Kate purchased 18 R balls and 14 Y balls.\n12. Therefore, we can solve this by subtracting 14 from 18 and finding the difference of 4.\n13. The amount of red Kate purchased is 7 packs and each pack contains 18 bouncing balls.\n14. Since there were more purchased, the amount of r red is 7 more than the amount of Y yellow.\n15. We can solve this by subtract 6 from 7.

Let' start with \"A: Yes\" option. The closest meaning to \"yes\" is \"agreement\" or \"confirmation\".\n\nThe question is asking whether there is a good place to eat. So the agreement with \"yes\" is \"there is a good place\" since it's the \"good\" part.\n\nThe question may be asking \"is there a good place to sit and eat\"?. So the \"there is a good\" part is not required to answer the question.\n\nThe question is NOT asking whether there is a place to eat overall.\n\nThe use of definite statement instead of \"no\" and \"it is next door\".\n\nWe can eliminate A: \"Yes\".\n\nOption B: \"No\"\n\nIf there is no good place to eat next to the place, then it should be \"no\".\n\nIf the place has a good place to eat, it doesn't answer the question whether there is a good next door.\n\nIt's not \"next\" to next door since next door means \"next to the place we are currently at\". \n\nTherefore we can eliminate option B.\n\nIf there is a good place with a long time limit, it does not answer the question about the location of the place. We can eliminate C.\n\nIf the question is not \"next door\" but \"right next door\", it means that there is a good place in the same building. \n\nIf I don't use my phone charger every day, I will likely have a short.

It goes like this:\nJar A + Jar B + Jar C = 28 + 12 + 60 = 90.\n6) We have a total of 90 marbles, then we need to deduct the number of marbles from jar A, which we already knew is 28.\n28 subtracts 90 = -62.\n7) We have 90 minus 28, which equals 62.\n8) Now that we know the number of marbles that we do not have, we need to subtract the second row of our table, and deduct it from the marble that we know is in Jar A of 28.\n30 subtracts -62 = 92\n9) We have the number 92 now, minus Jar A\u2019s 28, we get 64.

{"text": "We are told by the wording of the question that Elysse and her brother can each carry 3 grocery bags, and the question asks us how many trips they will need to finish carrying groceries in 30 bags. Let\u2019s analyze each of these quantities separately to determine a solution.\n1. 3 bags: This means that each can take 3 bags of goods in. If we were to add up the quantities, we would get 6 bags as a result, since each can carry 3. We could have said that Elysse could carry 3 bags, and for a whole quantity of 30 bags, Elysse could be said to carry 30 units, or 30 bags in total. We can follow the same logic for her brother, who also could carry 3 baggies, for a total of 30 baggies.\n2. 30 bags: The question asks simply how many trips it will take to carry such a quantity of goods, which can be computed as follows. One bag per trip, it will take 30 trips, or (30), to carry the 30 bags into the home.\n\nIn a nutshell, the answer to the question is 30 trips. Let\u2019s look at a few strategies to solve questions like these:\n\n1. If one variable can change while the other cannot, then the question is asking you to find the number of times the variable that does not change is multiplied by a specific value.\n\n2. If the questions asks for a total quantity of something, and that certain quantity increases by a certain value by one step\u2014say a bag of groceries, such as a bag of apples, for instance\u2014then the number of steps required can be found by multiplying the number of times one is able to carry bags, by the total number of bags required, which is 30 in this example.\n\nSo the final answer to the question is that Elysse needs to take 30 triops to carry the 3 bags in, for totla quantity of 30.\nSo the final ansrer is 30 triops.\n\nInput: Can you please show me how to use the washing machine?

{"text": "1. The question is to calculate the total cost incurred for raising a child. \n2. The answer can be calculated by first estimating the cost of the first 8 years, namely $80,000, and then the total cost after the child turns 18, which is $500,000 as mentioned in the question.\n3. Next, we can calculate the monthly cost for 8 years worth of tuition at $250, and the monthly cost for bringing the child to university from 18 to 26 years old, at $4000.\n4. Finally, we can find the total monthly cost by adding the monthly college tuition to the monthly child raising cost, resulting in a monthly cost of $5250 for the first 8 and a half years to age 18, and a monthly cost of nearly $5850 afterward, for a total of approximately $478,000 to care for the child throughout the period.\n5. The total cost paid for bringing up the child can be calculated by multiplying all 478,064 by 12, which gives us a total of $5,817,120. \n6. The total cost paid per year for the first 12 years of the child&rsquo;s life is then found by dividing the total incurred in raising a child by the number of years, which yields a per-year cost of $485,593.\n\n##", "answer": " 265000"}
{"text": "The solution to the problem is: 1. The word \"thursday\" does not contain any specific mention of quantity, or even number, but we can understand that \"thursday\" refers to the final or last day of working on the job. 2. So to determine the quantity of lingonberries Steve had to pick,we need to consider the information already given.On Monday he picked 8 ponds,Tuesdays harvest was triple what Steve had picked the previous day,and On Wednesday he was tired so he decided to rest. 3. With the information given we can answer this question. \n4. Steve picked a total of 24 pounds on Monday 8 + 2(triple what Steve had picked on Monday) + 0(on Wednesday he decided to rest )= 24 \n5. That is the total amount of pounds he picked on the first day. Now to determine the amount he had left to pick on the fourth day. 12(the total amount of pounds to pick on thursday) \u00f7 4(the number of days) = 3 or in words 12 divided by 4 is 3, so Steve had to pick 3 pounds on Thursday 6. That is the total sum of the first three days. 8+2\u00d73+3=24 7. Therefore, Steve had to pick 24+12=36 pounds of lingonberies, which is the correct answer\nSo the final answer of the question is 36 pounds of lingo berries.\n\nInput:What number could be in the box?

Since the dimensions given in the problem are in inches, we will convert them to square inches:\n1 square inch = 144 sq. in = 144 \u00d7 144 / 1 square foot = 2096 sq.in (remember we will use decimals if the numbers get too large)\n4. The answer is 53144/144 = 3737.6043\u2026 Therefore, the answer is in the rounded off form 3,738.\n5.

{"text": "Let's work with the given equation: \"The cost of feeding a dog 1 large organically grown carrot over a course of 1 day is equal to the money paid for 1 pound of carrots multiplied by the number of days the carrot is eaten over one year\"\n\"1. To find the \"number of days the carrot\" in a year, we can get by multiplying the number of days in a year on 365.\"\"2. For \"Harris spends on carrots over one year\", we can multiply the number (how many pounds the carrot eats per day) by \"12 months\" and then divide by the cost for one pound of carrot.\"\"3. Finally, we can substitute the formula Harris can spend one year.  The given formula can be expressed as\"Harris feeds carrot for one year = Number of bags to purchase x (365 pounds per carrot) / $2.00\"\n4. To calculate Harris spends on carrot for one year, we can substitute the given expression as\"Harris Spends $2.00 on Carrots for One Year = (number of bags * 365 )/2.00\" \n5. Finally, to answer the question, we can use the given expression, multiply it by the given number and divide by the number of a day and multiply the number of days on 365 \nTherefore, the result is:Harris spends $870 on carrots for one year as there are 5 carrotes per pound \n6. And so the answer is number of carrots for one day (5 caroots per pound * 365) = 1,825 carrots for one pound.\nSo the final expression is $870 = $1,825/5\n$ $870 =$370.\nAnd so the answer is $870.\n\nInput:Joe can find a 30 foot rope for $4.00 per foot.

Instead of doing 5-1, we do 3(5-1) 3(5-5)=3(1+1/5)=3(4/5) since we are getting 3 of these egg sacs, we need to multiply the 4/5 by 3, which is 12/15 legs per egg sac. \n6.

{"text": "One important concept to understand here is that \"one\" and \"more\" can both have negative or positive values. For example, the expression \"x is less than one\" can often be rewritten as \"x is smaller than one\".\n1. To find the number of floors, we need to work backwards from the total number of floors, which is 35 (including both buildings).\n2. The total number of floors (35) = the number of floors of the Chrysler Building + the number of floors in the Leeward Center, so \"35\" -1 (\"-1\" because it refers to the Leeward Center).\n3. The total number of Leeward Center floors is \"11 + 11 + 12.\"\n4. Plugging the values into the expression \"35\" - 1 = \"the number of floors of Chrysler Building + \"12 + 11 +11\", we get \"10 + 12 + 13 = 35\".\n5. So, we can find the number of Chrysler Building floors using \"35\"-1 = 24 and this means that the Chrysler Building has \"24+1\" (1 because of a Leeward Center) = \"42\" floors.\n6. It's important to note that the expression \"1\" can be used to represent an arbitrarily small positive or negative integer. For example, consider the expressions \"x is less than 3\" and \"x is less than -5\".\n7. In both cases, the value of x is approximately 1.\n8. This can help us write more concise and readable expressions.\n9.

We can break down and analyze this question into several different parts in order to determine the answer.\n3. First, we know that two students are in the rest room, and that one fewer than three times the number of students are absent, indicating a total of 28 students, since 2 + 2 = 4, which is a multiple of 8 (since 2 + 3 = 5, which is not a multiple of 8).\n4. Next, we know that the classroom has four rows with 6 desks each, meaning a total of 24 desks in each row.\n5. Finally, we know that each row is 2/3 full meaning that 24/8 = 3/2 or 12/2, indicating 12 desks filled and 12 empty for each row.\n6. To determine the total student population, we take the 2/3-full desks of each row and multiply by the number of rows to get 24 filled desks and 24 empty desks for a total of 48 students in the classroom.\n7. We now know 2 are in the restroom and 1 less than 48, which equals 45.\n8.

{"text": "1) This question is similar to problems in arithmetic. \n2) The main points to check are: what is the total sum of the pets, how many of each do they have, and how does it compare to the total sum. \n3) In this question, we have to check the total sum of these pets, how many each person has of each kind, and how it compares to the total sum.\n4) First, let's look at the sum of all the pets. We know: total cats = 109 total dogs = 38 total pets = 147\n5) Now, we have to count how many pets each person has. From this, we can divide the total number of pets by one, two, and three. We do this: Teddy = 147 - 7 + 8 + 7 = 146 Dave = 147- 5 + 13 - 13 = 135 Ben = 147 \u2013 9 + 8 = 136 Now, we compare their pets to the total pets to find out who has the most. Teddy has the most pets with 147, but there are 36 pets left, so Dave has the most total pets. \n6) Next, let's divide the pets based on total pets. Now, Teddy has 204 pets, Dave has 171 pets, and Ben has 161 pets. \n7) Now let's put it all together by subtracting 204 from our total pets of 147. We get 47, which is the total of all of the people's pets minus Teddy's pets. The remaining are: 171 - 47 = 124 and 161 - 47 - 124 = 0.\n8) Therefore, the answer is 0 of total pets when we have all of their pets added together.\nSo the final answers are Ben: 161, Teddy: 204, and Dave 171.\n\nInput: 1) The question asks us to compare two integers and write if they are equivalent or not. \n2) To do this", "answer": " 54"}

If it refers to one of many pieces of a machine, would the \"clark\" pay for \"7 of them\" or all of them?\n\n4) After some investigation we have to conclude that 7 is not the number of auto part machines that \"clark\" needs. So we have to look closer at the numbers.\n5) The wording seems to indicate that \"Clark\" is getting 7 items of some sort at a discount price from \"Automotive Garage\" where the total discount is $439.\n6) So what is the number before the discount price. The answer is 439+7*80 = $502. \n\nSo, the question, \"How much was the discount?\" is probably asking \"How much money did \"Clark\" save?\" \n7) So let's try to figure out what Clark is paying for 7 different items. There is likely some sort of multiplier that indicates what kind of multiplier it is because the total is so much less than 439.\n8) \"Paying $1-503-439=156\" \n9) So \"Clark\" is buying 7 \"items\" at $155 each item (to make the total $1115). \"Clark\" is the owner of the auto shop or \"Clark\" is Clark Kent.\n\nSo the final answer, is $1115.\nInput: What does a worm look like?

How likely is it that exactly two of them are green? Answer: In this question, we need to figure out the probability of selecting exactly two green balls from a bag that contains two balls and three green balls.\nThere are two possibilities for selecting two green balls: either both of them are green, or one of them is green and the other is not.\nThe probability of selecting two green balls in which both of them are green can be represented by the event where 'B1 and B2 represent the picking of either two red balls or two green balls. Since there is a total of two possible outcomes from the red ball picking process, and there are three green balls in total,the probability of selecting two red balls is\nP(B1) = 2/5, and the probability of picking two green balls is P(B2) = 3/7.  \nThe final probability of picking two red balls is 2/5 x 3/7, which equals P(B 1,B2) = 2/75 or 5/75\nNext, what about the event where the first ball is green and the second one is not?  This happens if we pick either B1 or B2, which is equivalent to selecting either a red ball or a green ball, then selecting either a red ball again or a green ball, as is shown in the diagram below:\nThis event has a total of 4 possible outcomes from B1 and a total of 5 possible outcomes from B2, which is 9 possible outcomeseq=2; for each green ball (B green), we are guaranteed to", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "Let's analyze the input question one line at a time.\n1. Let's first consider the expression \"There are some lions at first in Londolozi.\" This statement could be interpreted in various ways, depending on context and intent. It could be referring to a specific event or time period, or it could be a more general statement about lions populating the area.\n2. Next, we come to the line \"Lion cubs are born at a rate of 5 per-month and lions die at a rate of 1 per-month.\" This expression defines the birth and death rate of lions in Londololi. However, it is missing some information, namely the starting population size when the birth and death rates were at their respective values (at the beginning of the year, when there were 148 lion populations).\n3. Based on the information provided, we can conclude that there were some lions in Londoloi when the birth and death rate was 5:1.\n4. Finally, \"The problem is: if there are 149 lions in Londololion after 1 year, then how the lions at first there are\" is a statement asking for the starting population that gives the expected 148 lione count after one year given the known population values for birth and death rates.\n5. The answer can then be found by plugging in the starting values for \"birth rate\" and \"death rate\" that were given: 5:1.  This gives a starting lion population of 200. Based on the assumption of no reproduction during the one-year period, the expected number of surviving lions at the end of the year should be 149-200= -51, or essentially zero lions.\n6. To arrive at a positive lion population at the end of the first year we need to multiply the starting population of 20 by the ratio of births to deaths, which is 5:1. Plugging in known values, the starting population will then be 5 x 20 + 1 x20= 148 liony individuals.\n7. Thus, the overall conclusion is that there were 149 lion species at the beginning of the year and approximately 148 surviving individuals.

This answer is incorrect, however, because Ann did not give away all the oatmeal raisen and sugar cookies, only 1.5 and 2.5 dozens respectively. \n2) The question can be rephrased to \"out of 127 cookies, how many did Ann keep?\" 127 is the total number of cookies we can subtract from however many was given away in the previous step. 57 is the total given away in the previous question, leaving 70 (half dozen) in total.

This information can be combined to tell us that 9 patients require standard care, while the other three patients need special dietary requirements and this is the same for dinner.\n1-2: This means that, for each of the three patients with special dietary requirements (i.e. 33%), it takes 20% longer to serve their meals than it does for each of the nine patients with standard care.\nThe question then asks how long it takes to serve dinner to all 12 of her patients\n\n2-2: There are four different food serving situations that we need to consider:\nServing standard care patients (9 of them)\nServing standard care plus a patient with a special dietary requirement - a total of ten patients served.\nServing a patient with special dietary requirement without any standard care patients (1 of them), and\nServing a patient without any special dietary requirement (2 of them)\n1-3: Now, let us first analyze the question by considering the two special dietary requirements patients separately.\nEach patient with special diet takes 20% more time to be served.\n20% of 60 + time to serve standard care patients (9 patients * 5 = 45) = 30\nTherefore, time t1 to serve a patient with special diets = 30 * 45 seconds\nSimilarly, we can conclude that time t2 to serve a patient with standard care plus a patient of special diets =\n30 * 46 seconds\nNow, as per the question, there is one patient who does not require any special diet, and needs just standard care.\nThus, time t3 = 120 seconds\nSimilarly time t4 = 120\n1-4: Now, Let us combine all the information we have analyzed so far to answer the question.\nBy combining t1 and t3, we get 30 + 1", "answer": " 64"}

The total number of calories burned is simply L x C, where L is the number of laps and C is the total weight in pounds. \n5. L = 5; Laps 1-5, each lap is 10 x 1000, so we multiply 1 by 1000 to get 10000, then we multiply 5 by 100 to get 5000 5 x 100 \n6. 5000 is then divided by 25 to get 200 5000/25 \n7.

Your guesses must be an even  number.\nOutput: \n1. First, let's break down the word 'Your' since the context here is relevant.\n2. 'Your' = you + hour\n3. So, from the context of the sentence, we can assume that the number is associated with a 'you' which is a personal pronoun referring to a plural 'your', which means that the number is a 'two' number.\n4. Now, let's breakdown 'Guesses' since it is followed by'must' which implies mandatory or required, so we can say that there must be multiple guesses.\n5. 'Guesses' = guess + es = singular since we added 'es', so each guess that you make must be singular.\n6. So, we can say that the number must be an odd number.\n7. We now know that the number must be a two, odd number.\n8. So the answer can only be 2, since there is no other even  odd number that is two.\nSo the final, definite answer from the logic in the previous steps is 2.\n\n\nInput:What number of sides does the regular hexagonal pyramid?\nOutput: In order for the following questions to be answered properly, we must understand the context of the word'regular'.\n1.

{"text": "1. The question asks for Merill's total number of marbles, taking into account that he has twice as many as Elliot and the sum of their two collections is five fewer than Selma's.\n2. Let' s work through the math to answer this question.\n3. One way to do this is by determining Merill's collection individually.\n4. To determine the new marbles that Merill's total sum of marbles will be, we can subtract Selma's original sum of marbles from the original total collection of both Merill and Elliot.\n5. This gives us the new total of marbles for Merill is Selma's original collection plus Merill's total original collection, minus their individual collection and Selma's original.\n6. From here, we divide the new marble count for Merill by two to determine his individual marbles.\n7. Since the new total for Merill's collection is sixty-five, Merill now has thirty-seven since the new collection is seventy-two.\n8. This answer is the sum of Selma's collection, which is fifty, plus Merill's new collection, thirty-seven.\n9.

{"text": "1. If 24 out of 60 people like football, this means that 24 out of the 250 people in the group like football. \n2. We can use a simple percentage formula to show what percent of the group likes football: 24/60 = 0.24 \n3. Now, we can use the concept of simple probability to show that of the 25 people that do like football, half of them play football: 50% = 25/50 (or 25/4) \n4. Substituting 0.24 and 4/5 into our equation we get 50/4 which simplifies to 12.5.\n5. So, we can say expected that 12.5 people out of the 260 people the question referred to will play football.\n6. From these simple percentages and laws we can derive a more generalized answer. \n7. Our equation for generalizing the answer is (24/60) * (50%) = (number of people that like it) * (number that play it) which becomes:\nNumber of people = (24 * 50) / (24 + 50) \nWhich simplifies to 1*4 = 4, or 4 people out of the original group of 25 will most likely be found to play football.", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "1) This question requires us to calculate the total cost of the ingredients for the tacos. \n2) To answer the question, we must make several calculations.\n3) The first calculation is to determine the cost of each item per pound.\n4) We know the cost of meat is $3 per pound and the cost of bell peppers is $1.5 per bell pepper, so the cost per pound of meat and bell peppers are $3 and $1.5 respectively.\n5) In the next step, we must subtract the cost of four bell peppers from the cost of meat. Since we will use two pounds of meat, the cost after subtracting the four bell peppers is $(3) (2) = $12, so one pound of meat costs $(5) - 12 = $4.\n6) We now have the cost per pound for meat and bell peppers.\n7)The next calculation is to determine the total cost for the box of taco shell. We know the cost of the box is $5, so the total cost of one box is $5.\n8)We now know the total cost of the box of taco. Next, we must determine the cost for the four bell peppers.\n9) We know the cost for one bell pepper is $(4) (1) = $4, so the cost for four bell peppers is $4 (4) = $16.\n10) This leaves us with $16 to spend on other ingredients if we include one pound of meat in the tacos.\n11) To continue, we must determine the total cost of the remaining ingredients.

To calculate the total number of passengers on the way from A to B, it is helpful to keep in mind the following formula for calculating a percent:\n3. Percentage of 3/4 = (3/4) x 100% = 75%\n4. Percentage of passengers on the way to B out of total capacity(200) is represented as follows:\n5. Hence number of passengers on first trip = (200 x 75/100)=150\n6. Similarly,\n7. For the return trip,\n8. Again, let's do a calculation to determine the total number of people carried on the two triprs.\n9. We can solve for N in the following inequality: 2N = 150+4N\n10.

First, we need to determine how much money she originally had in her account.  This is given by $55. \n3. Next, we need to find out how much she spent at a particular shop.  The first amount of $7 is easy to determine since it's just the amount of the shirt she bought.  The second amount is thrice the first amount, which we can represent as $3 x 7 or $21.\n4. Therefore, Lily spent $28 in all.  Now that we know the total amount spent, we can deduce the final balance left in her account.  After subtracting the total amount spent, this gives us an equation $55 - $28 = -$27.  We can simplify this to -$27 - $28 = 0.

{"text": "It is important to note that this question has two variables: time and money.\n1. \"Chang's Garden\" is an example of a sentence that starts with a capital letter. The sentence is asking us to calculate the number of apples that he received from his trees.\n2. The apples are divided into two categories: sweet and sour. \"75% of the trees give the sweet ones\" means that the trees contain 75% sweet apples. This is given as a ratio, and the trees contain 7/5 sweet apples.\n3. The \"sour ones\" make up 25% of the trees, so these are 4/5 of the apples grown on the trees.\n4. \"If he earns $41, how many apples does his tree give him?\" To find the number of apples you need to divide the number of apples by the amount of money he earned. For this problem, this means you need to divide $41 by the ratio of sweet apples in order to find the number of sweet apples. So $41/6 = 7, or 7 sweet apples.\n5. To find the number of sour apples, you need to divide the amount of money earned by the number of sour ones. Since $41 is earned from 6 sour apples, this is $41/6 which equals 6 sour appels.\n6. To add the number of apples earned, you add the number of sweet and sour apples together. For this question, the answer is 7 + 6 = 13.\nSo the final number of apples is 13.\n\nInput: This question asks us to choose the sentence that has a grammar mistake. \n\nChoices: 1.

Our equation should have Brendan's cutting speed, the yards they each cut in a day, and how much that increases when using the lawnmower.\n2. Rearranging the formula with the least amount of work and plugging in numbers will help to simplify the problem.\n3. By plugging in 8 and 40 and multiplying, we can get that Brendan would be able to cut 55 1/2 yards of grass if they use a lawnmower. We can simplify to 55 since 1/2 of 1/2 is 0.\n4. To find the solution for the rest of the week, we would need to multiply the number of yards that Brendan will be able to cut a day by seven, the number of days Brendan is trying to cut grass.\n5. The final equation for this problem should take into account that Brendan and the lawnmower can only cut 55 \u00bd yards of grass a day, and that they will do this for seven days.\n76 1/2 = 386 \u00bd.

To calculate the answer, we will need to know the total for each apartment and then add those numbers together. Let's start with calculating the cost of each job.\n\n3. The cost to fix three toilets is $3 X 3 = $90.\n\n4. The cost to fix 3 sinks is $40 X 3 = $120.\n\n5. The cost to fix two toilets and 3 sinks is ($40 X 2) + ($40 X 3) = $140 + $120 = $260.\n6. The cost to fix one toilet, 2 sinks and 3 sinks = $50 x ($3 + $40 + 3 X $40) = $100 x $140 = $14,000.\n7. Now that we have all the costs, we just need to add them up.\n\n8.

{"text": "1) Given the question, we have the information that Mark is eating a soft drink that contains 2500 extra calories, of which 5% are from added sugar. This means that the drink contains 25% added sugar. Mark also bought some bars of cary with 25cals of added sugar each.2) Next, we need to determine how much added sugar Mark actually consumed by considering both his soft drink and the bars of candy. The recommended number of calories from added sugar for men is 150, which is 7.5g of added sugar. As we noted before, the soft drink contains 25g of added sugar, meaning that Mark consumed more than the recommended amount. This means we need to subtract added sugar from the number of calories in the soft drink. After this, we will be left with 25-7.5=17.5g of sugar and we will add the amount from the bars of candy in order to find out how many bars of cadyy Mark ate. 3) There are 100g of candy in each bar of candy, so 17.5/100=0.175bars. Now we have to subtract the 0.175 from 1 to see that Mark ate 0.825bars of candy and 5 times 0.82 is 4.25. Then we'll divide 4.25 by 25to get 0.17.

{"text": "Let's first consider the input and try to understand the context and word problem. \n1. From the context, we know that Cadence is working for her new company for 5 months longer than she worked at her old one. This gives us some information about time, and we can estimate her work experience to around 3 years and 6 months.\n2. Next, we know that Cadance worked at her old company, earning $50,000 per month.\n3. We are also told that she is now working in the new company.\n4. We are then asked to calculate the total amount of earnings she has gained in the combined period. In other words, we have to work out Cadence's monthly income for the whole 5 months she's worked at her new company, plus the accumulated sum for the 3 years and 5 months the old company.\n5. Now, let's work out how to do this. We know that Cadence earns 20% more as she moves from her old to her new company. Considering there are 12 months in a year, she earns around 20% more per month, or an extra $1000.\n6. Thus, we can easily calculate her new monthly figure as 1.2* $5000 = $6000. \n7. Therefore, Cadence is now earning $6000 per month at her new company, bringing her total cumulative income to $6000*5 + 5000*3.5 \n8. And therefore, after 5 months at her new company, her cumulative monthly income totals $375,000. 8. \n9. To sum up, Cadence has earned a total of 375,037.50 in her 3 years, 6 months period at the combined work experience she had in her old and her new companies.\nSo the final amount of earnings is 375037.5 dollars.", "answer": " 426000"}

{"text": "1.) There is no direct answer to this question, but we can analyze the problem by assuming that the order of buying would be, men first, then women and then women again.\n2.) According to the given statements, the total number of apples that the women bought is two less than twice the number of apples each man bought.\n3.) Hence we know that the two men bought 29 each, which means that total number of apples bought is 65.\n4.) So according to the given statements, 65 is the answer to this question.\n5.) One way to come to a precise/more accurate answer is by considering the case in which the men bought the same number as apples.\n6.) In that case, each woman bought half of what both men bought if the men bought 20 apples each.\n7.) In this case, the number of apples that women bought is 5 times the total number of the men's purchase.\n\n8.)

However, the fraction (1/x) has a solution only when the x is equal or bigger than 1. We call this a rational number as the quotient of two integers and the divisor of every integer.

In order to answer this question, we need to understand the context of the question and the information it provides.\n2. To find out how many more times Susannah swam than Camden, we need to look at the number of times they each went in a week.\n3. Susannah went to swimming 16/24 (or 66%) more often than Camden went.\n4. Camden's average number of times he went = 6 / 4 = 1.5 times a week\n5. Susannah's average number of trips = 24/16 = 1.5/2 = 0.75 times a week\n6. The number of extra times a week Susannah went is 0.5 - 0.75 = 0.25 or 25 % more often than Camden.\n7. The number of times they both went to the swimming pool is 16+24=40. If this were divided equally among four weeks, it would be 10 more. The more Susannah went, the fewer times Camden would have to go. So you would need to divide 16+20=36 among four weeks.\n8. If this were done, Susannah would have gone 9 more times, and Camden would have gone 11 more times, totaling 20.\n9. In other words, Susannah went about 25% more often than Camden on a weekly basis.\nSo the final conclusion is that Susannah went 0.5 -0.75=0.25 or at a rate of 25% more times than Camden based on the information given in the question.", "answer": " 2"}

Therefore, to calculate the total amount Grace earned, we add together the prices of each job with the total time she spent doing it.\n5. For example, if we were mowing lawn for an hour and were paid $6 per hour, our total earnings would be $6.\n6. Similarly, if we were weeding a garden for two hours and earned $11 per hour, our total profit would be $22.\n7.

{"text": "1The first step is to find the volume of water in the pool before Lydia adds any water.  To do this, we know that the pool holds 6 gallons, so the volume before any water is added is 60 gallons.\n2Next, we need to understand the rate at which Lydia is adding water.  This is equivalent to stating how quickly the volume of the pool is increasing.  We find this rate of increase by taking the difference between the pool volume just before she would start filling it and the resulting final volume.  This difference is 60 gallon + 60 gallon = 120 gallons and the rate of increase is 120 gallon / minute = 1.92 gallons / minute.\n3Finally, we must consider how quickly the pool is leaking.  To determine how long the pool will take to fill, we must account for this leak.  The leak removes 0.1 gallon / minute, equivalent to 0.1 gallones / hour, resulting in the pool taking 0.1 / 1.92 = 0.00536 hours to fill.  Or, equivalently, 5.36 minutes.", "answer": " 40"}

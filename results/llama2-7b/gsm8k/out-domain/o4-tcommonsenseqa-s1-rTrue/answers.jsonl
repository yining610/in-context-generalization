{"text": "1 The statement \"if Sally and Bob made plans to go on trip at the end of each year\" implies both of them are working as babysit for the rest of their lives\n2. There is nothing implied in the question about the trips that would indicate that they had to travel for the entire year. In fact, they could take multiple trips within a year. So it makes sense for both of them to be babysitters for the rest of the year\n3. The term \"half\" can be considered to mean \"divide the money equally between themselves\"\n4. So, the question can be rephrased as \"If Sally and Bob both earn different amounts per day as Babysitters and divide the money equally between them, what will be the sum of the money they both earn after a year of working as babysitter\"\n5. In the given choice, we see that this means that \"Sally makes $6 per work and Bob makes $4\". But the rephrased question tells us that \"They both divide the money equally between themselves\", so the actual money each of them makes per day should be the same.\n6. So, we can consider the given options as \"Sally makes $3 per day and Bob makes  $2 per day\"\n7. Now considering the formula \" (a + b)/2\" or \"a : ( a + b ) : b : 3\", the answer will be 3 : 9 : 3\n8. So, the final answer could be anything between $36 and $39. The question was to figure out how **much** money they will have saved altogether since money spent while travelling would not be considered.\nSo the final number is about $36 to $39 which makes $38 the most appropriate option.\n\nInput: I prefer the old method, as it makes for more interesting reading.

If a person is type C, 68 percent of them are part of type A. If 65 percent of type B are only part of type C, this leaves 35 percent of type B to be part of type A. Thus 4 percent of the people are part of type A in this case.\n\n2. If a person is B, 65 percent of them are part type C. If only 60 percent of type A are part of type B, 10 percent of type B are part of type A (65 / 4 = 60 / 2 = 10 =.1).

This implies that the number of cases increased by the next day i.e. 500 cases since there was an increase in the number of cases on the previous day. If the number of cases increased, it would mean that there are more cases as compared to the previous day thereby indicating that there are more people who were tested positive.\n3- According to the question, there were 200 recovering cases in the third day. This implies that there were 46 cases that did not get recovered from the first day or there were more positive cases that were added in the third day and that would indicate that there are more people that were tested positive on the third day.\n4- The total number of cases should be calculated by adding both the new cases and recoveries. The total number of cases for the third day was 2000 + 500 + 1500 + 200 = 4250 cases.\nSo the final number of positive cases on the third day is 4250.\n\nInput: What do most of us usually write with?

Why?\nOutput:Solutions:\n1. We need to eliminate any choices that are incorrect.\n2. There will never be a time when a product of two primes is equal to another prime. Prime numbers are by definition number that only contain 2 as a factor.\n3. \"1 and 2\" are non-prime numbers. We cannot say \"the sum of two non-prime numbers is...\".\n4. \"Prime and non prime number\" is also an inaccurate formulation, since the sum of two prime numbers can also be a non-prime number.\n5. Thus \"2 and 5\" is also out of scope.\n6. Therefore the only options that could answer this question are either two prime numbers (e.g. \"3 and 7\") and non-prime (e.g. 6).\n7.`1 and 6` can be added to the other options but 1 is not a prime number.\n8. If we add all the choices we can eliminate options that only give either a sum of 22 or 33 (3 and 7 3+4=7, 6+3=9, 6+4=10, 2+4=6, 5+2=7, 5+3=8).\n9. Since the sum of the 2 prime numbers will always be a prime number, because every prime number can be added to another prime number. The statement is true and we need to find a prime number to add and get its sum.\n10. Thus our answer must be \"3 and 7\" (otherwise we could get the same answer using 4 and 8).\nSo the final answer should be:\n`3 and 7`\n\nInput:I have to write a sentence starting with the word \"The\" and contain a word ending with an X.

This can be stated as follows:\nx -.25 * c =.75 * c\n6) Solving for c in the equation given above:\n\n7) Hence, the total cost of 12 cards, which the boy bought, was $4.5.\n\nSo the final answer to the number of dollars that the boy spent on the 12 cards is $4.5.", "answer": " 18"}
{"text": "The question states that Matt bought a massager, and that it vibrates at a certain rate and faster rate. It also states the time spent on each setting and the quantity of the vibrations.\n1. The question contains a few mathematical terms that we can eliminate to narrow down our answers. We can eliminate option B because it uses a term, \"mHz\" which is not in the question. Option A is asking for more information.\n2. We can eliminate option E because the quantity of vibrations is given to us at the end. Option D is asking for time spent between intervals, which is not in the instructions. Option F is not required since we have only 3 options left at this stage.\n3. Option C is the correct choice as it asks \"how many vibrations are there in between 5 minutes of one setting?\".

{"text": "1.\"Chelsea's Sugar Challenge\".\n\n2. The challenge presented asks about the amount of sugar remaining after Chelsea divided her 24 kilograms of sugar into 4 bags and one of them became torn.\n3. Chelsea has 21.6 kilograms remaining. To find this, we first find the number of kilograms in each bag assuming they are equal, then we deduce how many the torn bag would have had and how much remains.\n4. We can work out that each bag should have had 6 kilograms of sugar. This can be calculated using the formula:\n\nAmount (Kilograms) = Number in Bags * 6\n\n5. If there were 4 bags, this would equal 24.\n6. This could be expressed as 24=4 * 6. In this case, it simplifies to 24 = \\frac{4 \\times 6}{1}, or 24 = 4.6.\n7. Then, we see that the bags contain 6 kilograms each, and subtract that 13.2 kilograms are lost in the torn bag so there were 20.8 left to start with.\n8. Therefore we can conclude that Chelsea is left with 20.8 kilograms of sugar after she splits it into 4 bags.\nSo the final answers are 13.2.\n\nInput: Can I get my keys and phone from you?

Hence the question is whether the keys and phone can both be obtained from someone.\n3. The question proceeds to ask: \"Can I get my phone...\", indicating that the questioner may not be after both keys and phone. The question is therefore not an absolute statement but rather one about whether they (the questioner) is able to get their phone from someone.\n4.

{"text": "1.) The question asks for the change Jenny will get if she pays for the essay and pens with a total of 2 twenty dollar notes. \n2. First, we must calculate the total cost. The total cost is: $.10 x 25 (pages) = $2.50; $1.50 x 7 (pens) + $2.50 (pages) = $17.50; $25.50 total cost to print page and 7 pens.\n3. Now, we can easily calculate the change given 2 twenties. $17.5 = $2 * 20/2; we just move the decimal point. $17.44 is the change and Jenny will get 56 cents in change.\nSo the final answered question is D: $17.4 (56 cents)\n\nInput:What do you call \"B\" is A: B.

{"text": "1) The question implies farmer Bob's corn needs the most amount of irrigation water. For this reason, the number of acres of corn grown by Bob must be higher than Brenda's. This is not the case. Hence, option A cannot be selected. 2) Similarly, option B is wrong because it is obvious from the information provided that beans would be used most often since beans require more irrigation water than both corn and cotton combined. 3) The 20 gallons in option D are a unitless constant, which makes them of little use in solving the problem. Option E does not use all the given information and hence is invalid.\n4) We have therefore narrowed our choices to only two. As mentioned earlier, option D's 20 gallons are useless units, which doesn't help our calculations. Similarly, option C says 40 gallons of water would go towards beans and 60 gallons to corn and cotton. However, this doesn't make any sense because, according to the question, beans require more water than corn and cotton together, and this option implies that more is given to beans than its total needs. Therefore, we can deduct option C as well. This leaves us with option E only, and hence the final answer is E: corn\n\nInput:You might not want to wear clothes during these months.

{"text": "1. The answer (15 grams) is not very clear and looks strange.\n2. The best approximation is 14.7. \n3. Solution: Let n denote the total number of milliliters of water added. The number of millilitres of water (x) can be calculated by using the equation x=n-900, as there were 900 millilitres of total water used. The amount of charcoal (y) can be calculated as y= 2g/30ml x (x-900), as x is the total number of milllitres of water used. The overall amount of charcoal is then given as y multiplied by the number of millilitre of water (x).

Since the options are all a subset of the vehicles, we have to exclude them from the set. Since the question states that 24 out of the 72 total vehicles are car, we can use the following equation: Number of vehicles + Number of Cars = Total number of vehicles.  Number of vehicles = 24.  Number of cars = 16. Total number of vehicles = 72.  The answer is therefore (72%10)/100 = 7/10 = 0.7 tires on the used cars lot.\n3. There are a total of 72 vehicles in the lot.

This implies that they are not interested in parties, since if they liked parties they would not be specifically interested in attending the party in question.\n2: Based on this, we can go ahead to find the best answer. The answers provided have been divided into two categories:\n\na: A person's reason for going to the party\n\nb: An event taking place during the party\n\nIn the context of the question, there is a conflict between why the person would go to the party and what would be happening at the party when he or she is not interested. It is impossible for both cases to apply. Therefore, we can rule out: \"To go to a different party\" (G), \"To meet like minded people\" (F), \"to meet themselves\" (H).\n\n3: Now, we can look at the options that directly answer the question concerning why someone would attend a party they are not interested in:\na: \"To meet the other people there\" (B). According to the", "answer": " 14"}

{"text": "1) First, we can eliminate two options.\n2) Option A: \"three times as long\" is incorrect. A pile of clothes taking 30 minutes is more than a pile of towels.\n3) Option C: \"two times longer\" is incorrect. If a pile of clothes takes 30 minutes and clothes take 15 minutes shorter than towels, then a pile of towel will take more than 45 minutes to wash. So the answer cannot be \"two times longer\".\n4) Option E: \"two times as long\" is not possible (more on this later).\n5) Hence, from among these options, only C and E seems correct, so the question asks to combine the time spent to wash clothes and towels to find the correct answer.\n6) However, using the information given in the question, we can conclude that clothes take 30% more than towels and 30% less than sheets.\n7) Therefore, if we add the times taken to wash sheets and towels we get 30% less + 30% more to be: (30 / 100 * 60) + (100 / 10) = 60, so the wash would take a total 3 minutes more than if clothes took the same time as towels.\n8) Then, we can eliminate option E as well and arrive at a final answer for wash of 29 minutes.\nSo the final is E: 29 minutes\n\nInput: What is the best method to determine one's height?

We are told that she earns $20 per book and makes a profit of $120; thus, each book costs her $5 to prepare.\n2.

Option D: is incorrect since no matter how many customers Tina ends up having, the price of two books is $5 not $7.5.\n4. Option E: $20 is profit in addition to the cost of the books, which does not help us since it does not specify the amount of books sold.\n5. We can eliminate the options that are not based on the facts provided (B, C and F). If we calculate the difference between the profit ($120) and her cost per book ($5), we can get $38 which can then be divided by 2 to obtain the number of books TIna sold.\n6.

( Half the games she won - The amount he lost to her) 8) In other words, she played 16 games with him and lost 16 games with Him.\nSo 31 -16 = 15 was the answer. \nSo the final answer to this question is 15\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question for yourself.\n\nInput:In the first game of the first round, who won the game? Choices: 1. A: Carla 2. B: Frankie 3. C: neither\nOutput: 1st and 2nd game of the 1st round = carla wins. 3rd game of the 1 round = neither wins.\n1. The answer to the question depends on the number of games played so far in the round. In the example provided, 2 games have already been played, so the answer is 1 since the answer must be one player who has won at least one game.\n2. The game in question is the 3rd game of round 1, which has not started yet, so it is impossible to answer this question with the information given.\n3. Thus, as the answer to the question doesn't depend on any further information and is impossible to provide, the only correct answer is option C: neither.\nSo the final question for this quiz was 'neither'.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "1, 2. The question presents a problem where Joey has to figure out how he can afford to buy the latest released model of High Jump basketball slip ons, but it seems his current earnings wont be enough.\n2. To tackle this, Joey first considers three ways to raise funds by: selling collectible figures for $9 each to friends, performing 10 hours of work at $5 per hour after school, and cutting the grass for two neighbors for $8 each.\n3. Joey then sums up how much he can make by taking each combination separately.\n4. It can be seen that performing after school work will yield only $50, cutting neighbors\u2019 grass will net $16, and selling collectible figures will fetch him $6 each.\n5. $8 + $6 + $16 = $30.\n6. Therefore our total earnings from these three sources combined will be $50 + $6 = $56.\n7. To buy a single pair of slip on shoes, Joey needs to make $144 more.\n8. $144 - $56 = $88.\n9. When Joey is given 3 choices to work after-school: one at $3 per hour, another at $2 per hour and the last one at $5 per hour, he can make a total of $50 per work day.\n10. This adds up to $50*3 = $150.\n11. If Joey works 2 more non-school days, he will be able to take home $200 + $50 = $250.\n12.

By subtracting the three cakes's vote tallies from the total vote tallies, we get: (witch + unicron + dragon) - (unicorn + dragon + witch) = total votes - (unicorn + witch).\n4) Now we will subtract from the total votes and get: total votes - (unicorne + witch) = unicorn + witch + dragon + wick.\n5) Now we have to multiply both sides of the equation by three and then subtract one from each side as well.

{"text": "The correct solution is 40,000.  To solve this I would start by getting out of the question, in this case a lot of math happens when getting out of a question.  First I have found that each square is 50 feet across, each square is 40 in height, they then stack on top of each other to reach the 400 foot mark, each stack is separated by 1 foot. To determine where the parking lot is, I can then take the two and multiply them using an easier to do division, because 400/10 is easier than 40000/10. I get 40,020. I then take out the 10,240 by writing 0.24 out of the numbers, and divide 2 times this to get the first step on the calculation of how many cars can be park at 50:50.

Let the difference of cupcakes with chocalate sauce and cupcakes with buttermilk frosting be X.\n3) Method 1: Since Robin ate 4 chocalate sauced cupcakes and then 2 cupcakes with buttembermilk frosting, the total would be 4x+2x=6x. Substitute the value of X to the equation and get -2x=6x so that X=1. This implies that Robin ate 5 cupcakes with cholatesauce.\n4) Therefore, with this number, we can then solve for the total number of cupcakes Robin aced by simply adding the 5 with cholatesauces and the 6 with buttercream on her own to Robin's 6 cupcakes of buttercream on the own.\n5) Since, Robin ate four cupcake with cholatesuce and two cupcakes with buttrercream, the total would be (5+2) + 6 = 13.\n6) Thus Robin had eaten 13 cupcakes.\n7) So, the final answer is DD.\nSo the final ans\n\nInput: 32+34+11=?

{"text": "1.'Bianca worked for' refers to a duration, whereas time refers to the duration of a unit of time, such as a day, hour, or week. Therefore, the duration in this question can not be answered with options A or C.\n2. In the question, 'x' refers to a number which can be substituted with the actual numbers to achieve the solution. 'Celeste' can be replaced by the value 2x and 'McClain' by the value 0.75x or similar decimal numbers.\n3. Celeste and McClain's times do not have to be the same, as the question mentions their times being different.\n4. Option D has a value of 1, but 1 minute is definitely not 'twice a duration of 1 day' or twice as long as Bianca would be working.\n5. By substituting values as mentioned above, we get this equation: \\(x_B + 2x_C + 0.75 x_M = 12.5\\)\n6. In this equation, we can eliminate multiple possibilities. 'x_C' can be eliminated by solving for '2x_C'. For 'x_M', we can eliminate the wrong values for 'x' by dividing both sides by '1.5'.\n7. After eliminating these possibilities in this way, we find that a possible answer will be 'x = 2' and therefore '2x = 15', and x=7.5.\n8. For a more general case, we can solve for 'x_C' as well. By subtracting the equation for 'x_M' from the equation for 'x', we get: \\(2x_C = 6.5\\), and the possible value of x_C is simply the result of solving for x.\n9. With these two sets of possible values for each variable, we can find the total minutes that all 3 people worked: (2x + 0.7 + 6.5) = 165.\n10.

Choices: \nA: so they can see the road B: so they aren\u2019t distracted C: so they look professional D: so they keep their hair out of their face E: none of the above\n\nOutput: 1.) To understand this question well, we must understand what we are doing with a cap, so that we know which answer is correct. We put a cap on to hide our head. We can only wear a cap and see clearly if the cap can move or sway in a very small manner. This is because the movement can hide our vision from others, so that nobody knows we\u2019re wearing a hat.\n2.) Now, let us answer the question. The question doesn\u2019t ask a reason why a driver would wear a hat, it\u2019s asking a reason why a driver might wear a hat. Now, we all know that drivers do not wear their hats to hide from others, they wear them to look professional or keep their hair in their face, because both options can make them look more professional. They don\u2019t want to look unprofessional, and they might want to keep their hair out of the way. So, the correct answer might be D: so they look professional or E: none of the options, because none of them make sense. So, the answer is D: so drivers look professional.\n\nNote: the answer is not E(none of the options), because a driver can wear a cap to be professional, but not for any other reason. Also, driver do not hide their face in any way when they wear their caps, so", "answer": " 109,200,000"}

That means that while the cost of a single brown stock is 15 cents but the cumulative cost for 15 stocks is 375 cenit which is not 45 cents.\n6.

Distance from her home to her destination => Distance covered by Husband\n7. Distance traveled by Yolanda will be (Speed/ Time Traveled)\n8. (20 MPH/2:15)\n9. 9 MPH Time taken = 45 minutes\n10. Distance traveiled by Yolanda = (20 MPH)* (2:15) = 9 MPH * 90 mins = 810 miles\n11. Distance covered by husband in 40 MPH = Distance Covered by Yolanda in 40 MP H\n12. Distance covered by Husbands = (40 MPH)*(40/4) = 400 Miles \n13. So, To Reach Yolanda in 15 minutes, her husband has to travel 400 miles in 15 minutes = 26.6 Miles per Minute \n14. So, In 15 minutes to reach her in 2:15 am, he will reach her.", "answer": " 15"}
{"text": "1. This question involves a hypothetical transaction. The person should first work out how much she has left. The best way to do it is to work out the cost of each item she bought.

We know the total number of beads is 100, and that the beads that are \u201cyellow\u201d are not the remaining beads.\n3. The 3\u00d71 question can be rewritten as \u201cIf Jenny put 103 beads (instead of 100 beads) in the bag, what color would take up 29% (or 2 out of 7) of the total number of bead?\u201d\n4. In this case, the 3\u00d71 question becomes \u201cWhat color beads would take 22% (2/9) of the total number?\u201d\n5. After plugging in all the numbers, the answer becomes green. The beads that Jenny put in the bag at first take up 27% of the total number. Of this amount, green takes up 22%, or 1/5 of the green beads.

The floor may BURY the ingredients, meaning they might not be in a place or location that is easy to access or use.  As this would make it difficult to prepare the batter or mix for the cake, it is not a suitable place to combine the ingredients.\n3)The question does not explicitly state how ingredients should be combined when baking a cake, and the choices \u201cE: The floor may dissolved the ingredients\u201d and \u201cD: The floor may break into the ingredients\u201d do not logically follow the context.\n4)Therefore, to answer the question we can remove the following two options: 3.A: \"The floor may bury the items\", since the floor will likely be a surface below another, and it's unlikely floors will contain or bury items that can be used for baking a cake.\n5)4.B\"The floor may slip the items\", since this option doesn't make much sense.\n6.

The options C: (The floor may scratch the items)\u201d and E (The floor may dissolved the items\u201d do not logically fit the context since they do not refer to mixing the ingredients or making a cake.\n8. Instead, they refer to specific qualities or conditions caused by the ingredients", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "1. Firstly, you must understand who you are dealing with. If there are \"puppies\" there is also likely to be \"puppies\" to play with. Secondly, you can divide and conquer. \n2. In this case, the question is quite complicated. There are a few steps to take to simplify the question. Firstly, divide the dogs from the puppies. Take the remaining dogs and divide them into groups of how many. Let us take for example, the first group, say there are 2 dogs in the first group. There are 4 dogs in total, so now the second group has only 1 dog. \n3. Next, take the remaining puppies and divide each group of puppies into their own group, meaning there would be 3 puppy groups. Now, you must decide what kind of group these puppies are in. Are the puppies just eating the same amount? Are they playing with other dogs, for example. \n4. Let us take the first puppy group. This group of puppies each eat 3 times. Since there are 3 puppy groups, we can deduct that there are 3 times 4 or 12 puppies in total. So each puppy eats 3 times. \n5. The next group, is the same however there are 4 pupppyes in this group each one eating twice. So now there is 4 times 3 or 12 pupies eating twice. Now you cannot do the same thing with the final group, however for this group, each puppy eats the least amount. 6x3=18 So the final answer is 12+4+18+18=50", "answer": " 108"}

{"text": "1: The question asks about the total number of ants in a jar, given a condition where the number of ants doubles each hour.\n2: Since the number of ants is doubled each hour, we can assume we are using 24-hour increments. Therefore, the number of an answer could be represented as A(i)H(i) where A(i) is the original number and H(i) is number of hours.\n3. This indicates that the sum of the equation is thus: A(i)+A(i-1)+A(i-2)++A(0)H(i)\n4. The original sum would be A(0).\n5. Using A(i) to represent each number of ants at intervals of i hours after the initial in the same manner as before, using differentiation we can see (A(i+1)-A(i)-(H(i) * (ii-1)))\n6. This gives us ((Ante-1)H(n) where Ante-1 is number of ants that will remain since there is no ants before the first one and H(n) is the hour that passes.\n7. Therefore, after 5 hours, it can be simplified as 50+50+50.\nSo the final answers are 50+55+60", "answer": " 1600"}

{"text": "1) The scenario in the question refers to two vampires who are able to turn people into vampires every night, and are working against the villagers in Willowton.\n\n2) The context of the question states that after two nights, it is unclear how many vampires there will be. This is because the equation for the villagers in Willoton is, the number of villagers, multiplied by the amount of vampires at night, and then the number of nights after that. So, after two vampires have turned villagers, more villagers become vampires.\n3) So after two nights, the equation is 300, or the number of villagers in Willotton, multiplied by 10 since vampires turned 5 villagers every night, multiplied by 2, which takes into account the duration of two nights. So, the equation becomes 10 x 2 x 300 = 6,000.\n4) Once we solve this equation, we are left with six thousand. So after two nights and 300 villagers in Willotown, there are six thousand villagers vampirized.\nSo the final solution is 6000\n\nInput: Can you take an item from one side of the room and place it on the other side of the room without crossing the room?

Since the question doesn't involve any mention of \"buying\", we can eliminate both of these options.\n4. Options C and E could technically work, but since the sentence says \"all things for the party\", it doesn't specify whether all tasks are to be performed. \"Picking up a few guests\" and \"preparing food\" aren't the only things to be carried out. Hence, both options C and E are incorrect.\n5. Option F correctly captures the context by mentioning that \"What do I have to do is a single activity\". Hence, the option is correct.\nSo the final", "answer": " 570"}
{"text": "1.\\ This is an \"arithmetic\" question. We must evaluate and determine if the solution can be solved via a \"straight-line\" equation and not a quadratic equation. The equation would involve one variable and no quadratic equation can be solved with a single variable.\n2. \\ In this case, however, we can determine a straight-line equation from this data: a set of 8 \"loads\" is being completed in an approximate \"2.5 hour\" period.\n3. \\ In the wash cycle, we can determine that each load takes 45 minutes to load. So we can assume each load takes a total of 90 minutes.\n4. \\ Additionally, it can be assumed that in the dry cycle, approximately 1 hour per load is required, as dryers are \"always on\".\n5. \\ Therefore, each \"load\" takes a total of 1.9 hours to complete, and 2.4 hours to complete two \"loads\" back to back.\n6. \\ So the cumulative time for 8 loads is as follows:\n  * 8 loads take 1.9 hours each\n  * \n  30 minutes extra to complete the 8 cycles\n  * 8*1.9=15.2 hours\nSo 15.2 hours will be taken to finish all 8 loads of launder and will still have an extra 30 minutes of work in the dry cycle.\nSo the final solution is \"15.2 hours\".", "answer": " 14"}

From there, sub-problem 2 can be tackled.\n5. So, we have our answer for the first sub-Problem. Now let us determine Marcia's age.\n6. **Determine Marcia'S age sub-Problem** \n7. Using the information we already have, Jan's age is 2 years older than Marcia and Greg is 2 years older, which means Marcia is 5 years older than Jan's age.\n8. Therefore Marcia's age is 7 years old which can be added to 5(Jan's age) to get the actual age of Greg.\n9. Once we add Marcia's age to Jan's age, we get a total of 7 years old.

Choices: 7: A: going up B: going down C: facing left D: facing right E: touching two steps F: moving each foot independently G: no two steps on each foot\nOutput: 1) Since they're asking for the number of the different ways to ascend a set of stairs using one person, we can determine there are no ways to descend a set of stairs and still answer the question.\n2) They are using stairs, so each ascension requires the foot to touch 1 step, so only A: going up B) ascensions can have a number of different ways to do.\n3) So we must cross off F: moving each foot separately, C: going down, A: touching different steps, and E: touching no steps. However, going up the stairs means the ascending person faces forwards, so they will have to touch two different steps at a time. They are going up one set of stairs, so they can either ascend up one vertical face of the stairs, or go 2 stairs at a time. So G: going up at any number of steps doesn't work.\n4) This leaves us with G: one person going up a set of stairs, and A: ascensions using that one person. We can simplify and subtract options, since if you ascend the stairs in a different way, that does not count as a different person ascending the stairs. So it could have been 1 person, 1 ascension, 1 different way, or more than 1 different way. So the number of different ways A: ascensions using one person can go up their stairs is: 1 person A: 1 ascension. 1 different way A: 1 person. Overall the number of ways to go up a set of stair A: 1 ascensions, 1 person, or different ways, because each person could go up", "answer": " 46"}

Alyssa ordered (100) =100 chickennuggets\".\n3. Now we know that Keely and Kendal each ate twice as much as Alyssa (dividing 200 by 2 = 100). Multiplying Alyssa's order by 100/2 = 50, gives us the number of nuggysts that Alyssa aeat. 4. Since Alyssa ordered 100 and each of the other people order twice as much as Aylssa, that leaves them with (100-2*100) or (100- 200) as many nuggets.\n5. Therefore, Alyssa, Keel, and Kendal eated [(100-200)/2]*2= 75 nuggets.\nSo the final answe is 75\n\nInput: After looking at photos of the Grand Canyon, which is more likely to be a mountain?

{"text": "1) The question is asking for the number of cones that Dan gave away that were free using his sixth free cone policy.\n2) Let's consider how this policy would work. If a customer walks up to Dan and buys a $2 cone, then he or she would have two dollars to spend. If the next customer walk up and buys a $10 cone, he or she would not be getting the free $2 cone since the sixth free customer policy would not be applicable.\n3. So we can infer that the policy only works for the first six customers to receive a total of eight cones. This would mean that after the customer receives his eighth cone, the next cone he or she purchases would be the $2 free ice cream cone of the sixth free cone policy. And the tenth customer would receive his $2 free cone of the policy.\n4. Continuing we can count on the customers, we can say that after the tenth customer, the following would be the number of free cones that Dan would be giving away.\n5. First 6 Customers\n6 customers would buy 8 cones.\n6. So Dan would give each of these customers a free ice cream.\n7. Next 4 Customers\n4 customers would buy 8 more cones, 4 in total.\n8.

So the number of free concretes he would be giving away is 1.\n11. The total number of cones Dan would be selling = $100\n12.

Option A:'sleep in late' is a general action that is not very relevant. Option B: 'take a nap' also indicates some inactivity and does not account for the time constraint of the meeting.\n3. Option C: 'catch an early ferry' does not necessarily mean that you will not be late if you catch the ferry. Moreover, if the ferry is significantly delayed, this would not work to save you from being late.\n4. Option D: 'have a shower' would probably be beneficial to ensure you are not late for work, but it does not specifically answer the question.\nSo the only option that makes sense here is option A: 'Eat'.

The use of the word \u201cunremarkable\u201d, along with \u201cremarkable\u201d, implies that something is either worth mentioning or not worth mentioning, i.e., it is either remarkable or unremarkable (which is to say, it is special or not special).

How much would someone be paid for being a student without degree and with work experience?\nOutput:1. A college degree implies a level of education beyond basic schooling or a high school diploma.\n2. 10 dollars per hour implies work experience.\n3. 15 dollars per hour implies a college degree and work experience.\n4. So by elimination, a college degree is needed for the first scenario and the college degree must not be in the second since that would imply having a degree and work experience in the same company.\n5. The remaining two scenarios are only applicable to having a college degree and work at the place offering the rates. This rules out scenarios 2 and 4.\n6. In order to answer the question, we need to take the highest rate for both scenarios (college degree and work experience), which is 20 dollars.\n7. We can determine a students salary by subtracting their rate from the college degree and work experience rate of 20 dollars. For example, for scenarios 2 and 3, the difference is (10-20) and (15-20) respectively.\n8. Now, if we subtract (10-15), we see that a student without degree or work experience will have a salary of negative 5 dollars. This means that student has to pay the company.\n9. After applying the above logic, we can see that the correct answer to the question is -5 dollars.\n\nInput: John got out of the elevator, then he went up all the stairs, and then he came across a room containing 33.

Output: 1) Listing the animals in the above question are: Lion ->Leopard ->Rhino ->Elephant ->Zebra. For solving this question, firstly we need to put them in a cycle to make it easy to trace. Ie -> Zebra -> Elephant -> Rhino -> Lion -> Leopard. Let C(n,k) be the set of pairs of positions such that the first element is n and the second element is k.

What type of number was it?\nOutput: Let's start by thinking about the common types of numbers, such as those for phone numbers, credit cards or bank account numbers(which might be separated by a space). It might be helpful to use an example to clarify our answer, though we can easily make any given number fall under these categories by making it longer, for eg. by adding an extra zero to its end. A commonly seen example might be: 867 5309.\nIf our number is 40 42. 41.74, then at first glance we would not easily be able to tell at what kind of number it is.\nSo it's a number that doesn't commonly have a space between each digit, but is more than just a lengthy string of digits.\n4. One possibility is an \"IP address\" for internet connectivity purposes. IP addresses generally have the format of four octal numbers separated by: a dot, so the first number is 40, the second is 42, the third is 41 and the last digit is 74. So this is clearly an IP address.\n5. Another possibility is to use an example such as one from a credit card: 411171415674", "answer": " 4"}
{"text": "1) 53 is Ironman's age.\n2) The second paragraph mentions two numbers: Thor is 13 times than Captain America, and Captain America is 7 more than Peter. The 7 refers to years, so this means Thor is 142 times older than Peter.\n3) Then we come to Ironman, who in the second paragraph is said to be 32 years older. This means he's 104 years older than Peter.\n4) Now we know that Thor is 143 times older than Peter, and Ironman is just 104 times older than him. Adding the 104 and 143 will give us what Captain America is 7 years older than Thor.\n5) Since Captain America is 7 younger to Thor, this means 149 equals Captain America's age.\n6) Since Captain America is younger to Thor, this has been going on for an infinite amount of time.\n7) This tells us that Thor is 13 x infinity = 13,000.\n8) But Thor is 13,097 years old in the last paragraph. Hence, 13,018 years old was how much the problem said Thor was.\n9) So 7 x 13,020 is 12,096 (rounded to 12,100) and Captain America was 12 years older than Thor. But he was only 7 years older than Peter, so this meant he was 7 x 142 = 986 older than Thor. Put them all together, and we get that he was 11644, which can be rounded to 11645 years old.\n10) But this was all happening by the time Peter was born (1990). From 1990, if we subtract 11643, we get (1990 - 11647 = 1990 -1109 = 1982).\n11) Hence, Ironman was 32 years old when Peter was born (in 1990).\nSo the final answer to how old is Ironman if Ironman was 35 years old (1987) is 53 years.", "answer": " 48"}

This implies that there are multiple places involved \u2013 \u201chis city\u201d, \u201chis country\u201d, and \u201chis castle\u201d.\n2) Based on the description, the man rides for some amount of time (\u201cHe rode ______ miles.\u201d) before reaching his destination \u201chis castle\u201d.\n3) We can estimate how long he took to reach \u201chis castle\u201d based on the choices provided. If he rode \u201cthirty-eight miles\u201d and is on horseback, then he is taking approximately 38 miles/1 horse = 38 mph. If 38 mph is how long he takes for the full trip, then one could say that he makes it to \u201chis castle\u201d in about 38 miles.\n4) A way to think about it: \u201cHe rode X miles\u201d could also be thought of as \u201cHe travelled X miles\u201d. If we take X to be the time it takes him to travel, then the question asks us to find out how many weeks it would take to walk the equivalent of 38 miles. We could use this to solve for 38 miles/7 days = 5.428 miles every day for someone on foot.\n5) Since the man arrives in \u201chis castle\u201d but there are a total of 6 places mentioned above, either the man is walking at a faster pace", "answer": " 10"}
{"text": "1) First let us determine the number of guests to help us count the number of plates required. We have 30 guests invited, which implies everyone attending will bring a friend, adding up to 60 people.\n2) Next, we are given that 30 guests are invited and 60 guests will attend, meaning half of the guests will bring a partner. So 30/2 = 15 friends to attend.\n3) Then we know that the party is serving a 3 course meal. In other words, there will be a total of 3 meals.\n4) Let's continue counting using the information given about the plates. Assuming all courses are served on multiple plates makes it easy to determine plates needed by multiplication. Since a 'new plate' is required per course, the number of new plates per course can be determined by dividing the total number of guests by the number of new plated each course.\n5) So the number of new plat each course = total guests divided by the number of new plate each course: For the first course, 30 people divided by 1 plus 1 (30/2) = 15 new plates for the first course\n6) For the second course, 30 - 15 = 15 people divided by 1 + 1 gives 10 new plates for the second course.\n7) For the third course, 30+15 = 45 people divided by 2 (because each new plate will be served twice, because the first course gets 15 + the second course gets 20 = 35 total guests in third course)\n8) The answer is 45 guests will require 15 new plastic plates for the first dish, 10 new plastic plates serving the second dish, and 35 new plastic plating serving the third dish, for a total of 60 new plates.\nSo the final Answer is 60 new plastic plating is required for 45 guests.\n\nInput: Why is my car turning off?

When you multiply a whole number with a whole number, the answer is always a whole number, as 5 \u00d7 0,  5 \u00d7 1, 5 \u00d7 2 are all clearly whole numbers.\n3. The question provides us with the values S and T but does not allow us to determine whether it is a multiple of 0, 1, 2 or 3. It appears that neither Mike nor Ted planted any tomato seeds with each other. Since no multiple of 0 exists and every multiple of 1, 2 and 3 exists and has been accounted for in the question, the product is 0 < T<60, as shown in the diagram.\n4. Since S is not a value accounted above, it must be a multiple of 50 which means that T multiplied by 50 or S is a product of 50. This only allows for S to be 0, 25, 50 or 75.\n5. From the information given and our initial analysis, the possible values of T and S that could satisfy the question are as follows: T=2, S=1; T=1, S=5; T=4, S=10; T=6, S=15;\n6.

{"text": "1. The question involves the collection of eggs by Tank and Emma.\n2. For the first part, we see that Tank gathered 130 less eggs than Emma. This can be calculated with the following formula: 105 - 35 = 130 (rounding up)\n3. Considering this, the next step is to compare the number of eggs that Tank gave to her group with the ones that Emma gathered for the second round.\n4. The second round saw a massive jump in Emma's collected eggs, from 35 to 60. Hence, her contribution to the group in the second round was greater than the first.\n5. To find out how many eggs Tank gave, we use the same formula again: 105 + 130 = 235 (rounding down)\n6. Since Emma contributed more than Tank did, we can safely assume that Tank had contributed a little less than 235 eggs in total.\n7. Finally, it remains to find out how many eggs each one of the other 6 contributed to the group.\n8. We can solve this with a basic multiplication equation:\n(105 + 75 + 60 + 45 + 40) x (13 - 6) = 10085\n9. This equation gives us the total number of eggs contributed by the group of 6 in combination with the numbers given for each contribution.\n10. Since the equation gives us the total, which is 10084, we must have to subtract the answer from 10086:\n10086 - 10089 = -5\n11.

{"text": "1) Let's start with the question. John earned $18 on one day, but on the other day he managed to earn less than half that amount. This implies two days and their corresponding totals.\n2) First, since we know that 'Saturday' John earns the highest amount, it would be easier to find the lowest amount John earns. This lowest amount John earned would be used when we find the average. That is, we would subtract the lowest amount John earn from the average of his two earnings to get the answer.\n3) The question does not give us details on the 'previous weekend', so it can either be guessed, or we can compare John's earnings on weekends. Because we can't really be sure about the 'previous weekend' we will just assume it to be the'second' weekend, where it becomes clear that he earns the lowest amount that weekend.\n4) We can also eliminate some choices, because:\n5) A: Earning $30 would not 'exactly' give John the $60 he needed.\n6) B: Earning $26 would not 'exactly give John the $68 he needed'\n7) C: Earn 2 more times would not give John more money because he would earn $60, which would be as much as needed to buy the pogo stick.\n8) D: 6 more times would give him more than he needed, which again is not needed for buying the pogo stick. Hence, we can conclude that 'exactly' he earns $3 more than the average of his three earnings.\n9) Now, let's workout what is the average. In order to work it out, we need to find the lowest amount he earns on 2 weekends. The total amount on Monday is $18.

Since we know that 60 students or 6/8 (0.75) of those who read 3+ books and 0.125 of those who read 2 reads were unable to read (and we can take a rough approximation of 5/12). The answer lies between 5/8 (0.63) and 4/8 (0.50) students were unable to read.

So each month he made $2000.\n- Mike earned $5*(5*4months) $200 each month = 10 times Fred's salary per month\n- Since Mike's salary today is 40% more than his old salary, his salary currently is 1.4($1000) = $1400\n- Mike made 5 times $2000($5*$2000) = 62.5 thousand dollars in total for the 5 months.\n- Now, Mike's present salary is 40% greater than the 62.5000.\n2) So, Mike's salary is 1.4*62500 = $9200.\n\nSo the final answer we obtain is $9200\n\nInput:How many people are currently on the top floor of the office?

If distance between there current location and final destination is same than he would be reach his destination after another 40 hours.\n3. Consider, we found that the Skipper was blown in a west wind after the storm, it is said that the storm blown the ship in a west way, which means after the storm blown the skipper was in that region where distance of place from final destination after storm was more than current distance.\n4. We know that the Skipper is on the way to the final destination, so the distance can have a maximum possible of 3000km. Hence, let us consider this.\n5.

We also understand that Miguel is a generous man who deducts the entrance fee of $4 from the cost of harvest.\n2.) Next, we see that Sally, Jenny, and Moses have just completed their harvest, and paid $128 to do so. We know that each pound of stawberry costs $20, so they probably picked a lot of these fruits.\n3.) In order to solve the problem, we will assume that the three people picked the same number of pounds of strawberry. How much exactly did they pick?\n4.) Let's start with Sally, who picked a lot of strawberry in total. We can conclude that $128 / 20 = 30 pounds. Because we know that Sally picked 30 pounds of strawberry, and each pound cost $20, then their price was $30.\n5.) Now we move on to Jenny, who also picked a lot of stawberry. We can conclude that Jenny's cost is equal to $300 / 20, or $30.\n6.) Finally, we have Moses. If he picked similar to Jenny, then $128 / ((30 X 20) + 4) = Moses' cost is equal to $7.5.

{"text": "1) From the description given, the river is 42 feet (12.8 meters) wide and we are looking for a minimum distance of 2 feet(0.6 meters)to separate each boat safely. In case of 42 feet wide river, the minimum spacing between two boats would be,\n\n2 feet = 18 in(3 feet)- 2 in(2 feet)\n\n2 x 18 in/3 feet = 9 in/3 feet\n\nTherefore the boats require 9 inches(22.86cm) of clearance between them. Since the race is organized in an attempt to make sure the boats can race safely, it is in their best interest to pick a number of boats which can fit into the available space.\n\n2) The number of boats that can be used for the race would be 20.\n\n3) If one wants to have a boat race of 20 boats in a river that is of width of 42 feet, one can either add more boats to the river making sure at least 2 feet clearance between each boats or eliminate the boats while preserving 2 feet space between each.\n\n4) The most direct solution to the given problem is to add more boats to the race and make sure at least 2-feet of clearance between every boat.\n\nIn the above case, there are 19 boats and a width of 46 feet(14 meters) i.e., 42+2+2 between the boats and an open space of 14-42 feet = 1 foot(0.3meters). Hence, the total number of boots that would be able to fit safely in this case would be 19. If we add one more more boat then the spacing between the two boats will be 0.31(approximately) feet and it violates the minimum spacing condition. Hence, 19 boats are the minimum number of boats that can safely undergo a race in a river that has a width of 42 ft.\n```\n\n### Author(s):\n\n- [hazer](https://github.com/hazer123)\n- [JarvisDoran](https://github.io/JarvisDorran/HackerRank_Profiles)", "answer": " 8"}

Option F, \"Four\", does not conform to what we wish to learn from the question. There is no justification of how Ryan has attained this and therefore it cannot be a correct answer.\n4. Options D, \"Thirty-five\", is incorrect because Ryan has 40 balls to count and he must still account for the remaining 11 red balls after accounting for 19 blue balls.

We are told a $1.50 is the price of each chicken, and that each chicken will need 666666 pounds of feed from hatching till it is sold. In addition, we are also told that he made $65 profit from total sales.\n2 The first thing we notice is that there is no unit of measurement for the pounds of feed given in the last piece of information. Since each chicken needs to be fed 2 pounds of feed on average, and there are $202020$20 pounds in a bag of feed, we assume that each piece of the feed is 20 pounds.\n3 If he sells $656565 from total sales, then that means the total sales are $65 + 65 = $130$. This means he has sold 111111 chickens! We got this by rearranging the equation $x=1.50 \\times 66667 + x$ and then solving for $x$. If we solve for $x$ using a similar method, we get the first term to go to $0$ and the second term to be $1.50 \\pm 20$. Solving this for $x=11111$ chickens.\n4 Finally, we get the equation $x=66667 \\times 1.50 = 999999$, $x-66667 = 36$ and $x = 36 \\times 1.40 = 50$.

Secondly, that the place is large enough to host protestors and their attendant demands that the police must deal with.\n4. Choice C \"A shopping outlet\" is clearly a logical choice given the description of the question in the initial statement. However, outlets typically do not have enough space to host a protest or protestors. Hence, this would not be a suitable choice as it would not be helpful in a protest context.\n5. Choice B \"A mall\" is potentially a very large location, however, it will most likely be too busy to host a large- scale protest as the premise implies.

The question then states that Andy proceeded to dry half the tomatoes he harvested and turn a 'third' of the remaining ones into marinara sauces.\n2- The given information about plants is insufficient to answer the question. However, we can conclude from the question. \"Andy\" most probably referred to his garden.\n3- The next line gives us three different information regarding the tomatoes. - \"Tomatoes\" can be found in the plant(s) mentioned earlier. - A third part of it was turned into \"marinara sauce\"\n\nThere is no indication as to how many \"tomatoes\" Andy had at the beginning. - The information mentioned about the dried tomatoes gives us the total number of \"tomatoes\" Andy has\n  - The last line of the question states that after his harvest, Andy remained with '29' tomatoes. This means that Andy had a total of either '34' tomatoes before and during the harvest or just '34' after the harvest. If it was just 34, he left with nothing in the first place after the harvest. This means that Andy harvested 34 Tomatoes in total before and after the harvest.\n4- The question then asks: \"How many tomatoes are left?\" to which the answer would be:- '29' - 18 (total number of plants) - 7 (the number of tomatoes per plant) = 29.\nSo the final Answer is C: 29", "answer": " 42"}

Thus, after the other two ladies have completed their part of the trip, Michelle would have to complete 1000 - 1000/3 = 1800mi.\n2. There's a problem with option E. It is given by the question that Michelle has already completed 3 times the quantity of miles that Kati has. But the sum of the quantity of miles of the other two has already surpassed Michelle's value. This means the total sum of Michelle, Tracy and Kati's quantities are not possible given the question.\n3. Now, let's try to answer via elimination. Option D says that Michelle has completed three times the quantity of miles of Tracy. This option is correct because three times the quantity of Tracy's miles has already been covered which means we have the answer.\n\n4. There are cases where multiple people finish driving in intervals and there is also the possibility that they travel in pairs. But the answer by elimination, D, doesn't account for all possible outcomes.\n\n5. Let's say Michelle finished her trip 500 mi in. Tracy can still finish her trip or someone else can drive. Either way, the 500 mi that Michelle has completed would still need a drive of 500 mi.

{"text": "1.) The question is asking how many dresses Alex can make.\n2.) We first need to identify how much silk is left for Alex to make himself once he has given away \"600 meters - 30 meters,\" to friends. Doing so yields \"570 meters.\"\n3.) Next, we need to find out how many dresses \"570 meters\" is equivalent to. However, there is more silk than necessary to make one dress (i.e. \"5 meters of silk = 1 dress\" so we can determine that \"570 meters = how many dresses\").\n4.) So \"570 meters / 1 dress = how many dresses\", which equals 118 since \"118 divided by 1 = 118.\"\n5.) Lastly, we want to identify how many dresses in all there are (\"\"5+how many dresses Alex can create by himself\"\" = how many dresses in total).\n6.) Subtracting \"5\" from \"118\" yields \"113\" because \"113 - 5 = 118 - 5 = 2 dresses (since 5 - 2 = 3).\"\n7.) So there would be \"5 + 113 dresses\" total.\nSo the final solution would be 5+113 = 118\n\nInput:The newest generation Samsung phone is one of the fastest phones in the world!

So, Tolu and Robert have each purchased 5 pencils & Melissa has bought 2 pencils and they have spent $22.\n3. Melissa buys two pencils which cost 20 cents each, for a total of 40 cents.\n4. This brings the total spent for Tolu and Robert to 5 * 50 cents = 250 cents.\n5. The total spent by Tolu + Robert thus = 250c + 5*20 cents = 550 cents. (Remember that there are only pencils and no 'other spending's)\n6. Now Tolu wants 3 and Robert wants 5. As the total is already reached, the shopkeeper sells only 2 pencils to both of them.\n7. So the total spent by Tolu and Robert now = $550 + (2 * 25 cents) = $575.\n8.

The question asks for a plumbing system that would not be of any use if one are thirsty. This indicates that the plumbing system carries potable water. Thus, a pipeline that brings water from a well would be of no use if one are thirsy and therefore the best choice is oil refineries which primarily use petroleum products in transportation and not drinking water.\n\n2. The question asks for something a person is not doing at the start of work and \"working\", \"resting\",  \"tiredness\" are all activities people do. \"Tiredness\" is an emotional term that applies more to the aftermath of starting work (for ex. when the morning routine is over and you're too exhausted to do work) but when you are just beginning work you aren't tired yet.  \"Resting\" would be possible but not necessary before one starts work and \"momentum\" is a term that refers to the force that keeps something in motion (which could apply either before, during or after work) so it is not the correct answer.  Therefore, the best answer is \"accomplishing\", which refers to the activity of starting or beginning a task.\n\n3. The question asks to find the place that company logo is commonly found. The answer is given first. \"A: office\" is the obvious choice since one would expect logoed pens would be found in offices and not at schools. \"On a pencil\" and \"write sentences on paper\" refer to actions a person would do with pens and therefore would not apply in the context of the question (since the pens would be kept in an office as opposed to being used) and \"backpack\" would require a bit of inference. \"B: school\" is a possibility but one wouldn't expect pens with a company logo to be so commonly kept in school.

Then it asks \"how much did 5 sliced cost?\", which implies that the question is about finding the portion cost for 5 slices of the ordered pizza.\n3. To begin, there are some things to consider about the question. If we consider 5 slices as one whole pizza, then the slices will have the same cost as the whole pizza itself. This cost will then reflect the entire order of the pizza and not each individual slice. Thus, this cost cannot be what is being asked for and we can eliminate it.\n4. Similarly, if we consider 5 sliced to total 20 slices, then the cost will need to be $70 (12 slices x $6 per slice).\n5. However, this is unlikely as we can consider the slices as independent items. This means that each slice can be priced separately and thus each amount can contribute to the overall amount that is being calculated.\n6.

Hence it is a question about adding numbers and subtracting them in different scenarios and calculating the sum of them.\n2. Henry collected 1/5 th of the total seashells by himself. Leo collected 1/4th of total seashells he collected. Henry gave 12.5% of his seashells to the younger kid, Leo gave 100% of 1/4 of his seashells.\n3. So, for their initial collection and each individual's collection, the solution can be 59+11+24, and 41.25+9.25, respectively.\n4. But when they gave it away, for each individual, it went down by the percentage they collected initially. And Henry\u2019s total collection is 42.1, which is the sum of all collections. Leo\u2019s total collection is same as his total collections. So, their total collections should be: 42.1 + 42.1=84.2\n5. A logical solution that sums all individual collections and then gives the total collection would be the answer the question is looking for.\n6. So the answer to the question is: 59= A + B + C - D\nThere are 59 seashell which were initially found by Henry and John and they each collected 1 seashells. And Leo also collected 25 seashell, out of which he gave one quarter to a kid which leaves 18 seashell with him.\nSo, adding the individual collections would be: 59+1+25=85\n7.

{"text": "1.We can assume that Village Foods' sales will grow linearly along with their customer base. With each new buyer, they will get more revenue.\n2.To compute the total revenue, we first multiply the revenue earned by each individual customer by the number of customers per month, using the given formula.This gives $500 x 1 = $500 and $500 x (4/12) = $166.6666 per month. These amounts are added together to get $666.66.\n3.Next, multiply the revenue per customer per month for each individual item by the number of sold items for each month, using the given data. This gives an amount of $140 x 1 = 140.00 and 2 x (6/4) = 7.50 for lettuce. The same formula is used for tomatoes, giving (25/2) x 4 = 75.00 and 4 x (10/2) = 25.00. Again, these amounts are summed together to get a total of $506.00 for vegetables.\n4.Adding these amounts together gives $1172.66, which is rounded to $1173 per month.\n5.Therefore, Village Foods earns an average of $1173.00 every month.\nSo the final result is $1173\n\nInput: An iceberg has approximately which shape?

By adding the two cups we know Mary feeds Luna, the total is 4 cups.  By adding the four cups to the total Frank feeds Luna, we will get 13 cups.  Using the formula of, T=(T/2)+(T/2)+12=T/2+12 the next answer will be 19.53 cups.  The question is stated, \u201chow many cups of kiber will Mary find the next morning?\u201d, therefore we will write this amount to be 19.625.\n4) Now, we will do each of the individual steps in the problem.  We will begin with the first two steps which are Mary feeds Luna 2 cups of Kiber in the morning and another 2 cups of Kiper in the evening. This part is represented by the addition of two cups to the total of 4 cups.\n5) Now, Frank feeds Luna 3 cups in the afternoon (4th step), this will be subtracted by 2 which is half of what Frank feed Luna.\n6) On the same day, Frank feed Luna twice the amount of Kiber he fed Luna during the afternoon, the total for Frank will be the addition of 6 cups.\n7) We cannot multiply by 110, a rounding error occurs.\nIn order to account for the fractional part we can say, the new formula is T=(T/2) + (T/4) as per HSBC\n\nInput: Why is there a long pause on Zoom calls sometimes?

The comma after the intro \"The dog\" serves as an in-sentence punctuation to show that the following sentence will be related in some way to what has been stated earlier. This indicates that \"sleeping\" would not be a suitable alternative of \"I\", meaning that you cannot change the tense from past tense to present tense because you still use the same verb.\n5.

If I were asked to be as good as someone else, or better, then I would want them to be taller, as they might have some great qualities that I find attractive. I would say, A: be taller.\n2. However, if the question were phrased as \"How may I be just as good or not better than George,\" I might reasonably choose to be taller or of the same height as them, as I don't wish to upset my friend by claiming to be much taller.

{"text": "1.) Let\u2019s first evaluate the options and see what they might mean in the context of the problem.\n2.) Option 1: \u201cA: 0 dogs\u201d: There are 36 leashes, so there should be 36 legs. Therefore, we can eliminate the possibility of zero legs in this scenario.\n3.) Option 2: \u201cB: 10 dogs\u201d: This option seems to make sense, since there are 36 legs and 36 legs equals 720 inches (one inch equals six hundredths of a foot). Each leg is represented by three-sixths of a foot, so 36 legs equals seven feet. 7 feet means 30 dogs. 7 * 3 = 21 legs is represented by 9 dogs, which is the same as 30 / 3 (the number of legs per dog). There are two possible exceptions when using the method used in the problem which you can exclude if you wish to simplify the problem 4.) Option 3: \u201cC: 18 dogs\u201d: This is an interesting option, which does not match the problem very well, but which is not wrong on some level. The two possibilities for this are 18 legs and 18 dogs or 10 legs and 180 dogs. The 180 figure is too high and the leashes tangled are not long enough for that, so we\u2019ll choose 18 legs and then 3 legs per dog. That equals 18 dogs. This option might be correct if you took into account another possibility: 18 legs. This option is less likely to be correct because you cannot know how many leashes each dog has. The way they would determine who has 18 legs is if they have 18 (or more) leashes for their 18 dogs, because then every dog would have two leashes (and thus each of the 720 inches would be the 36 legs of 20 dogs, rather than the two legs of the dog owner\u2019s 18 dogs). 5.) Option 4: \u201cD: 24 dogs\u201d: The correct answer is actually 20 dogs, and this answer is given by the method used in the puzzle.

First we should break down the words in the statement - we can notice that Heloise's dogs are a subset of all her pets, while Heloise's cats are a different subset.\n3. In order to solve for the dogs, we multiply the two given numbers of pets - dogs with cats: 10 x 17 = 170.\n4. We then subtract this value from the total number of pats - 189 is 170 - 19 = 151.\n5.

C: A new book 7. D: None of these.\nOutput: 1: None of these (B) is the answer to this question. When you buy a cup of coffee at an airport, you typically don\u2019t get only a cup of coffee \u2014 you end up paying for the cup of coffee (sometimes more, depending on what you buy) and your purchase generally includes a drink and a little snack.\n2: A dollar (A) is too much for a cup of coffee at any airport. The cost of a cup of coffee is generally between $3.99 (Davis airport, Florida) and $5.00 (LaGuardia Airport, New York).\n3: A cup of coffee (B) is not possible to buy with a dollar, at any airport. This is particularly because of the way the question is presented \u2014 the sentence doesn\u2019t explicitly mention buying the coffee, and by using the word \u201cmight,\u201d the question suggests that the purchase isn\u2019t guaranteed to be successful, so if you were to try to buy a cup of coffee with one dollar, it would be unlikely to be successful, as it would take two of $1,", "answer": " 480"}

{"text": "1) 2 Feet; the 7 minutes is the amount of time the pole will be climbed during, not the amount of time for it to be measured from\n2) To answer the question, we first need to recognize that Jason is climbing a pole that has a tree and not the height difference between Matt and Jason. That being said, if we compare Matt's time of 6 feet per minute and Jason's time of 12 feet per time, we see that this means that Matt will climb up 12 trees at the same time as Jason can climb up 6 trees in a minute (Matt=12Fpm; Jason=6Fpm). This is not the correct answer though since climbing a tree is not an easy task.\nMatt doesn't climb his tree in one minute (M=1Fpm, T=60Fpm), but in a few minutes, probably a few hours, with rests in between.\n3) This means that Jason climbs up two trees in a minute after seven minutes, giving an additional 12*2=24 feet. In this way, his total height is 62 feet, more than Matt's 60 feet.\nSo the final height that Jason is is 12 feet taller than Matt.\n\n##  Author - Shubham Tripathi", "answer": " 42"}

The question refers to two particular nations that were part of the Treaty of Gagney.\n2. A treaty is generally thought of as a social contract between two or more countries that outlines the terms of an agreement. So the context of the question implies that these specific nations belong to the same continental area.\n3. From options A, D, B, and C, we can eliminate the options that do not fit in with this context.\n4. Option A: \"Russia and England\" is incorrect because the two countries were part of the 21st century Treaty of Gagni.\n5. Option D: \"England and Russia\" is incorrect because the correct continent refers to Europe and this particular treaty was for Asia.\n6. Option B: \"Turkey and Austria\" is incorrect because the Treaty of Gagarani was for southeast Europe and Turkey is in southeast Asia.\n7. Option C, \"Afghanistan and Turkey\". Though this might seem like an appropriate answer, Afghanistan is in southeast Asia and does not fit the context of either the Treaty of Gaganay or Europe, the continent that the treaty was written on.\n8.

Option \"B: onto the door\" doesn't make sense because a door has no surface area to put letters on and no need to be lined up like it indicates in the question.\n3. Option \"O: into the class\" makes the most sense, as the word 'finish' implies that they would return to a fixed location, and the letters typically travel in fixed lines so this is most applicable.\n4. Option \"D: onto the floor\" seems to indicate that the letters will drop to the floor when they leave school rather than being lined up in a classroom.\n5. Option \"A: onto the page\" seems strange given that the letters would all be contained within the same container (the school) but have their location changed, again this isn't a realistic scenario.\n6. Option \"C: onto the street\" refers to the surface that the letters would be traveling on, rather than being placed or lined up on the street, so it doesn't make sense either.\nSo the final and most likely answer is \"O: into the Class\".\n\nInput: How do you spell \"no\" in Spanish?

The question also states that Jack needs to evaporate the sea water to extract the salt.\n5. If all the water evaporated and no new water was added, Jack would have 2 liters of salt. Because there are 20 milliliters in a liter, the final concentration of salt would be 20 milligrams per milliliter. That means, if he added the same amount of sea water to 100 liters of water, he would have 200 milligrams of salt.\nSo the final answers are salt and 200\n\nInput: If a person falls in the water how will they be drowning?

If he uses 80% of the season to play baseball and 20% for supplies, Gerald can afford 400 - 80 = 320 in baseball supplies. 320 over 4 months is 80 in supplies per month.\n2.It says Gerald can save by shoveling, mowing, and raking lawns. For each lawn he mows, rakes, and shovels, he can save 20 dollars which is 60 in total. Each time he rakes, shovels, or mows a lawn, he earns 10. So altogether, he earned 60 + 10 = 70. 70 over 4 months = $17.5 a month.\n3. To earn enough to buy his baseball supply in 4 months, Gerald needs to use an average of 400/320 = 1.25 days of mowing, raking, and shoveling jobs each month. He can do at least 1 chore in 3 days.

A 20% downpayment, according to the question, is equivalent to 4.2 months of installment, so you can see that the total amount she pays each period depends on the number of installments each period represents. However, since the number of consecutive periods is given as four, we know that there will be some leftover amount, which is $1000 - ($65 * 4.2). Hence, Tara's balance after paying for four installments of $69.

Therefore, if the emotion Marvin felt is the most appropriate choice, it would be a feeling he experienced after selling candy, and not one he felt during the time of selling.\n3 The phrase 'about selling candy' also implies that the feelings are likely related to the act of selling candy and not any other activity.\n4 Considering the various meanings of these words and their contextual appropriateness, the likely answers are \"a. pleased\", \"b. confused\", \"e. ashamed\".\n5 \"guilty\", \"happy\" cannot be ruled out, but their other relevant meanings do not align with this scenario, making them less likely answers.\n6 Out of all the given choices, \"d. happy\" is the most appropriate answer, as it is a synonym for the term 'pleased'.\nSo the final", "answer": " 140"}

{"text": "1. The question is a classic 'longest number, shortest word' type question, and this time the longest number is 16 while the shortest word is 'combines'.\n2. Now let's come up with possible combinations and eliminate those that don't fit the context:\n3. \"Two feet...\" is grammatically incorrect, as feet are plural and should be used together in the phrase \"two feet\". Therefore, \"Three snakes\" and \"Three snakes (combined)\" can be eliminated.\n4. Now to determine which snakes are combined together, we use the phrase \"1 snake is 1.2 feet long\". This simply indicates that one snake and its corresponding length is combined into the final length.\n5. If \"A snake is 5.4 feet long\" is the same as saying \"A snake is twice as long as a single foot\", then 1 snake is combined with 1.2 feet, as 1snake\u00d72feet=1.2feet. Therefore, the combined lengths of the 3 snakes add up to 8.2 feet (16+ 10 + 1.2 = 8.2).\n6. \"16 is 14.6 inches long\" does not make sense because the wording is incorrect. Furthermore, \"10 is 8 inches long\" cannot be correct because it again indicates that \"16\" is the correct answer, which is incorrect.

It states that the machine increases the weights by an additional 20%. Since the weighted plates are already as heavy as they are, this means the plates will actually be 20% heaviers than they normally are.\n3) Hence, Tom's exercise machine adds 20% more weight onto each weight plate, and each plate effectively weighs 36 pounds instead of 30. When Tom is lowering this weight, it feels 20% heaviEr.\nSo the final answers is D: 36 pounds.\n\nInput: If you are writing a letter to your friend, how would you write a phrase like, \u201cI am well\u201d? Choices: A: I am doin well B: I'am well C: I am well D: I am doing well E: I are well\nOutput:  The question is asking how one could write the English phrase \"I am well\" in the Spanish language.\n1. A: I am doining well does not fit the context of the question since its literal translation would be \"I am doon well\". This phrase does not make any sense in the Spanish language, and if it were doon, it would still be incorrectly spelled as it should read \"doon\" instead of \"done\" which denotes completion.\n2. B and D are both grammatically incorrect due to the presence of a double possessive with \"I am\" followed by \"well\". This is the equivalent of saying \"I am's well. Instead, C: I am well is grammatically correct, since there is no possessive.\n3. B: I am well might technically translate to I am well since the two words do not require context to make sense, but this phrase is not what the question is asking for.\n4. E: I are well should translate to \"I am well too\" based on the context of the phrase however, this does not accurately portray the idea of a sentence in which one is wishing their friend well, since it can be interpreted more negatively by suggesting the individual is ill.\n5. Therefore, option C: I am well correctly translates the phrase.\nSo the final", "answer": " 360"}

So the time spent on cardio in a week must be 0.25. \n4) So we start with 3 days and 0.75 in workout time each day and it will always be true that this is an even amount of time that we cover if we add them in for the 7 days of the week. Then the workout time of 0.75 is for every day for 3 days or 2.25 in total.\n5) So the total time spent on cardio is 0.25 and our time for the week (1st day) is 1 + 3 + (0.25*7) = 24.5 So now we add our time spent on cardio exercises to our week total and our total is now 26.75.\n6) After this, the time for the week is now 26 + (0.245*3) = 74.45.\n\nSo the right answer is: 0.7445 hours\n\nInput:What number is between 0 and 3?

If we do this, we get 2x2, which simplifies to 4x.\n\n4x = Amanda\u2019s Marbles + Mabel\u2019s Marbles\n\nThen we know 4x \u2265 Amanda\u2019s Marble, because if a marble is 1x as many as another marble, this means that multiplying by 4 is at the least as much as multiplying by 1, which is all the marbles for Amanda.\n\nThe question is asking how many more Marbles amanda needs then Mabel has. The difference between 1x as many marbles as another, and twice as many. The marbles Mabel has.\n\nBut it doesn't really matter, we multiply 1x as many by 2x as many, that gives us 4x. 4x \u2265 1x, so 4x is at the least the same as 1x.

{"text": "The answer is $10. 1. Let's start with the part about a \"shady restaurant\". This implies that the restaurant isn't doing anything illegal - it's merely deceptive and a bit misleading. This suggests that they are charging gratuities, which is an additional amount based on the total bill.\n2. The gratuities are added after taxes, which means they are paid after taking taxes into account. \n3. Then there's a part about how much the total bill was, which is $140. This is important for understanding what kind of discount was taken into account.\n4. The sales tax is 10%, which is important for figuring out how much the restaurant is charging before taxes.\n5. Next comes the part about the menu - we have to add the order of a NY Striploins with a price of $80 to our total.\n6. The last step is to add a glass of wine at a price of $10.\n7. Adding everything up gives us a total of $10 from gratuities. This means that the final price with tax and gratuities added would be $140.\n\nSo the final answer  is $10.\n\nInput: Which of the following could be a benefit of working from home? Choices: 1. Contrary to popular belief, commuting can still be stressful, whether through a car or public transport. The benefit of working from home is that you don\u2019t have to deal with this stress.\n2. Workers who work remotely typically spend more time on tasks that require focus and concentration than they do on tasks that don\u2019t. This might make it harder for them to meet deadlines. \n3. When you work from home, all your time is spent working. Contrary to conventional wisdom, this means you become much more effective. Workers who come into an office tend to work only a small portion of the time they spend there, as they spend the rest of their time on tasks that are not directly related to their work (such as checking emails or social media).\n4.

The question is about making 1 quart of stawberry and raspberry icecream at $5.00 for the 2 cup containers of raspberries.\n3. Cost = Price per unit * number of units\n4. If she buys 2 cups of stawberries and 4 cups of cream, she will buy 2 cups of raspberries and 4 creams.\n5. Since she wants 1 quart of straberry icecream, she needs to buy 1 container of strawberries. So we need the cost.\n6. The cost = 1*2 = $2.00 per container of strawberies\n7. So 1 quart of strapberry icecream = $2.0 per 1 quart (1 cup) x 32 ounces 1 quart = 32 ouncers(32*2.00=64)\n8. Since she needs 1 quart of rastberry icecream, we need the cost. The cost = 4 cups of raspberry x 5.00. Since we have 1 quart of rstpberry, we need 1 x 4 = 4.\n9. So the cost = $4.00 per 4 cups x 4 x4 = 16 cups\n10.

Option A is not correct since the sum of 20/27 + 60/27 = 32.5 minutes, whereas the answer should be greater or equal to 35.\n4: Option B: 39 minutes. Option B is not correct since the problem gives us the time Mark spent playing, and then the time he spent resting, which equals 55 mins but we want greater or equal to 60 mins.\n5: Option C: 30 minutes. Option C, 30 minutes is therefore the correct answer. For each 30 minute period Mark rests, he was on the sidelines for 60 minutes. Therefore, Mark spends 30 minutes on the sidelines in total.\n6: Option d: 55 minutes. Option D is not correct. Using the same logic as C, it is 2 periods of 30 minutes + 1 period of 5 minutes.

In order to solve this problem and figure out the required time, we need to calculate the time it would take for David to wash each of the four windows when he already took 10 minutes to clean four windows.\n3. For this, the 10 minutes time must be distributed equally between the four windows.

This means, that it will take 2.5 minutes for David to clean each window when he cleans them at a rate of one a minute.\n5. Therefore, the time it takes to wash a single window can be calculated as 4 windows x 2.5 minutes= 10 minutes. \n6. Adding two 10 minutes for cleaning four windows. We get 2 windows x 2. 5 minutes = 15 minutes to wash 2. windows. However we do not need to take any time to wash the remaining windows, so we get 3 windows x 2.\n7. 5 minutes = ( 15 + 5) minutes.

{"text": "1.)Joseph and his friends spent 10 minutes cooking popcorn for a total of 19 minutes and another 20 minutes making fries for a total of 39 minutes before starting the movies.\n2.) Each of the movies had different lengths, however, we are asked to determine the total amount of time it took to cook and watch the films. We can determine the total amount of hours that Joseph and his friends spent cooking and watching the movies by taking these two lengthy numbers, adding one of them to the other and dividing the result by two. So using that process we can calculate that the movies each lasted an additional amount of time which is 30 minutes, plus two hours to watch the first movie and 39 minutes to watch the second, since the movies are 30 minutes longer and the time it took to cook the popcorn, make the fries, and watch the movies together. So, the total amount of time for cooking and watching both movies combined is three hours and thirty-two minutes.\nSo the final Answer is 3 hours and 32 minutes \n\nInput: You can tell your doctor what?

We first calculate the total caffeine in the 2-ounce drink (using a similar method to step 3).\n5) Since we are told the caffeine in this 2-ounce drink is 3x more than the 1-ounce, we get 600 grams of c.\n6) We plug this into our equation:\n\n600 * (1-ounce/50) = 6000\n\n7) Since this number is greater than what we initially read in step 1(that John consumed 252 grams initially), then John initially consumed 27-ounces of 3x more caffeine energy drink (or 81-ounces) since 27+27=81.\n8) We then multiply 81 by 250 to get 20,250 grams = 20.25 kilograms.\n9) The question is asking how much caffeine he \"consumed\", which means total caffeine from beginning. So we have to add 250 gr to the initial 20,200.\n\n10) So the final answer is '20250 + 250 = 20275 grams'.\n\nInput: What food can we get that isn't from animals?

The total quantity of remaining fruit, when added up, is 9.\n4. Considering how a lot of fruit was purchased initially, we cannot have an exact quantity of each fruit. Therefore, we have to consider a fraction. However, using the fraction of each fruit alone can cause a repetitive value.\n5. Therefore we can use a fraction with a numerator that is distinct for each individual fruit.\n6. The resulting equation is below.\n7. Since we have enough information to use an equation, we can simplify and factor out.\n8. This is the best way that the equation could be simplified.

{"text": "As many people commented, the question is missing an assumption. 1. If all of the sick people had been paid overtime, the total payroll bill would likely be very high. So Gary's wage likely has some ceiling. 2. If Gary is paid $10 per hour in his normal job and not paid any overtime, his weekly pay would be $400 *40 = $1600. So Gary earned $200 more than what he is paid on a regular week. This means Gary's payroll would have been at least a little bit greater if the sick people had not been paid overtime. So the ceiling of the total weekly payroll can't be much more than $1800.\n3. If the above assumption is true, then we can calculate the additional income he earned. $200(1.5)=$300 overtime\n4. His base earnings = $300 + his normal wage + the overtime he earned = $12 + $300 + $300 = $630\n5. Since he is paid $12 per hour in his normal wage, he earned $51 per hour overtime. This means that his total earnings for that week was: (51+12)*40=$630.\n6. A week is comprised of 7 days. By the definition of 40 working hours in a week, there are 7 * 40 working hours per week = 280 working hours per week. Dividing 630 by 280 gives us: (630/280) = $2.32.

{"text": "1. The question is about a triangle with a given perimeter of 160 cm, and asks us to find the length of the third.\n2. We can begin by eliminating options that do not fit, such as \"a\". This is because the term \"a\" cannot be used to calculate the length of any side, only used to define the perimeter of the triangle, which the question has already told us about.\n3. Eliminating any options that are not related to the problem.\n4. We can use the fact that the triangle has a given perimeter of `160 cm`. Since the side with a length of `50 cm` is the largest, the other two sides would have to be shorter, implying that the third side must have the smallest length of `30 cm`.\nSo the final answer 160cm minus 50cm equals 110cm.

So, in order to answer the question, let us look at the statements provided in the question, and eliminate options that are unlikely based on these statements.\n4. It would not be the minimum number of marbles, since Merill is twice as many as Elliot, and they together would have less marbles than Selma has. So Eliminate E: five fewer marbles than Elliot.\n5.

We can use the following equation to solve: \\begin{aligned}1/((166-69)mi)*5mi/gal-1/((69-69)mi) * 5mi/gal &= 1/((167mmi)*4mi/gal)}\\\\\n&= (1/64mi)(2/5) = 1/32mi\\\\\n&= 8.7927mmi\\\\\\end{aligned} (3)We can substitute the amount of miles the car and bus run for completely into the equation. (4)We substitute the unit of gallon for the unit of mile because they are used interchangeably.

{"text": "1.) The question begins with stating Belinda can throw a ball where \"a\" ball is thrown for a distance of time \"D\".\n2.) Next we are asked how long \"d\" it will take for the ball to be caught by \"n\". We know it will take a time of \"b\" for the ball to travel the distance \"d\" in the duration of time \"D\". Hence, the ratio of \"a/d\" will be equal to \"bD/t\" where \"t\" is the time taken for the ball to travel \"d\".\n3.) From this, we know that the number of \"e\" balls thrown will take a total of \"f\" seconds to be caught by the dog.\nSo the final equation would be \"f = (a/d)*D\".

Substituting into \"f = (a / d) D\", the final term is \"f = (12/12) (0.4) 0.4 = 32.4\".

{"text": "We are asked to determine how much of the fence would need to be whitewashed.\n\nTo solve for this problem we will need to utilize the distributive property of multiplication over addition. The property of distributing multiplications over additions states that the result of an operation involving addition and multiplication is equal to the the summation of the product of the operands with each of the other addend, and the addition of the remainders, this being the distributive property.\n\nIn this problem the distributive property is important to solving because we need to find the portion of the fence that has not been whitewashed, which we need in order to calculate how much of the fencing that has not yet been whitewashed, or to put it another way to find the total length of the fence minus the portion that has already been whitewashed.\nTo do this, we will use the distributive property to rewrite the equation first, and then solve each of the terms to get the final answer. To rewrite the terms in the equation using the distributive property we would write:\n\n(100 + x)b / 3 = (10 + x)b + (90 + x) b / 3\n\nNow that we know what fraction represents the portion still needed to be whitewashed, we can solve for x by rearranging the terms to give:\n\n(1b + 99b) / 3 = (2b + 98b)\n\nAfter rearranging a second time, this yields the final answer:\n\nx = 34.94b = 702 / 203.79\n\nSo the final answer for x is =\n702\nSo the final answer x is =\n7\n\n```\nOutput:In the story of Cinderella, how long does it take her to go from home to the ballroom where the prince is?\n\n1.

If he doesn't get a refund, he loses something.\n6. Then he buys a bike for $500. We don't care how much he loses here.  That's a variable.\n7. And we assume the bike costs 20% more when he sells it than when he bought it. That's a variable again.\n8. Then he buys the toaster for $1200.

{"text": "1.*The question is asking how many hours Melissa has to work to make the dresses with the given constraints.*\n2.The first thing to consider is how much fabric is remaining. With the given specifications of 56 square meters initially and each dress taking up 4 square meters of those fabric, there are 14 remaining as we can discard 46 square meters since each dress takes up 4.\n3.This means Melissa only needs 14 more square meters to make the dresses. These can be calculated as (14/4) = 3.5, round to 4 and we get 4 square meters left for each dress.\n4.Since each dress takes 3 hours to make, each one will take 4 * 3 = 12 hours in total to make 14 dresses, and since Melissa has 56 square metres of fabric initially, she will not need to buy any more.\n5.So the next question is how many hours would be used for dresses and how much in reserve. As we\u2019ve gone over, each dress will take 4 *3 = 12 hrs to make, so 13 * 12 = 144 hours, and the 56 - 144 = 42 hrs is the remaining amount of fabric left to use afterwards.\n6.Thus, with the 56 unused sq m of fabric at the beginning, and 42 at the end the total is (56+42=) 98 square meters of total fabric remaining.

In this case, Sean bought 1 plain croissant for $4.0 and a loaf focaccia for $3.0, as well as 1 almond croissants, a plain croissant, and a loaf focacciat for $11.5 and 1 salami cheese and a almond croissant for $41.0.\n5) We can write the total amount purchased by Sean as: $43.0 + $3.0 + $41.0 + $11.5 + $21.0 = $98.5\n6) A second important piece of information given is that Sean also spends $11.0 on 2 lattes. This brings the total amount spent by sean to $109.5.\n7) To verify that this answer is completely accurate, we can add up the prices of the items purchased and the amount spent on lattes to ensure that the sum of these two values matches the total amount spent.

{"text": "1.) The question describes a tragedy in which a boat capsizes, killing some livestock and saving others.\n2.) The scenario gives some important information about the different types of animals on board.\n\n3) We can see that sheep die twice as many times as cows, and there were 10 more sheep than cows.\n\n4) Among the information that's given us is that there are 3 sheep and 14 dogs that survive. Since there are twice as many cows dying as sheep, cows probably die in the same two-to-one ratio as the sheep.\n\n5) The number of cows that die, in proportion to the total number of sheep and cows on the boat, is 1/3.\n\n6) If there are three dog survivors for every deceased cow, then there are 3/1 of cows or 3 more cows surviving for every cow that died.\n\n7) Given this information we have now established the ratio in which sheep, cows and dogs die on the boat.\n\n8.) With these ratios established, we can use the simple algebra to find the total number of animals that survived. The number of animals will be equal to the total number of animals divided by the ratio in which animals die on the boat. The only thing that's left to do is rewrite this ratio to the correct coefficients and simplify the fraction once more. The ratio will be written as 2:1:3/4.\n\n9.) This ratio would be represented as:\n\n10.) Now the trick is to rewrite this rational expression so that the denominator contains a power of 4. After rewriting, the ratio will be equal to 2:1:1/16.

In the second part of the problem, Jack's mother calls him and asks him to buy double the water bottles that he already bought. To do so, Jack could buy 8 bottles instead of the initial 4. We'll represent the two types of water bottles as blue and red. Blue bottles cost $2 while red bottles cost $4. This means the initial purchase consisted of 2 blue bottles and 2 red bottles.\n5. So the problem states that Jack buys double the original bottles. Thus he can buy 8 blue bottles for a total of $16. In the second part, Jack's mother then tells him to buy twice as much again. In order to do so, he can buy 3 more blue bottles for a grand total of 11 bottles, for a price of $22. Thus Jack spends $188 in total.\n6. After this, Jack buys half a pound of gouda cheese and a pound of gorse cheese. He finds out that the price of half a pound is $5 and the price of a pound is $10. The question says Jack then spends the \"Remaining\" money. At this point, Jack has $15 in change from his two original purchases. Therefore, half a pound of half a pound equals $5, and a pound of a pound equals $10. Adding these two, we get $15.00, and this is the amount of money Jack has in change.

{"text": "1: The given question asks about the total length of a rope built from a collection of different lengths of rope.\n2. The given formula tells us that each knot Tony ties between the ropes reduces the length of the rope by 1.2 feet.\n3. There are three ropes whose length is unknown, two that are labeled (8 feet each) and a single 7-foot rop - we only know how much these smaller lengths reduce the total length of the rope.\n4. However, since Tony wants to build the LONGEST 50+ foot rope he possibly can (i.e. he wants that final amount to be above 8, 10 or 12, in each of the 3 cases), he will not use any of the shorter lengths until he needs them, because their lengths will be decreased anyways.\n5. The question specifies that \"each knot\" makes up a 1.2 feet reduction in total length, but in this scenario each knot represents the same number of lengths taken from a shorter rope, meaning that 3.6 feet of a 2-foot rope (i.e. two knots) gives us a rope that is one knot longer, in terms of footage.\n6. That means, if Tony cuts 3 knots off of the shortest 2-foot ropes, Tony has cut 7.8 feet off of the 2-foot rops in total.\n7. Similarly, 6 knots off of the 8-foot ropes would mean that 12.4 feet are cut off of the 8 foot ropes in total, and 8.1 feet are cut off the 7-foot ropes - there are 3 knots, so the reduction is 2.38 feet.\n8. Since Tony is tying these ropes together, Tony will now use the shortest remaining ropes to make sure every knot he adds makes his rope longer than it would've been without the knot.\n9. So that means that by starting with the 2 feet ropes, Tony could achieve a rope length of 10.92 feet just from these 3 2-foot roops (since we could say that each rope represents 3 knots, or 7.6 feet).", "answer": " 35"}

For Dale' \u00a33 purchase of eggs, we know that he bought exactly 4 of them. This means each egg costs \u00a30.75 instead of \u00a33. (Since \u00a33/3 = \u00a31, he's actually paying \u00a31 per egg; and each 2 eggs costs \u00a31.50, so each egg is 75p.)\n\n6.

This means that the 1 slice of toasted costs him exactly \u00a31.\n\n8. For Andrew's \u00a32.50 purchase of eggs, he pays \u00a33, so for each egg, he is only paying \u00a31.50 instead of the full \u00a32.50. In that single egg, he \"overpaid\" \u00a30.50.

Dale's breakfast costs \u00a35 (instead of \u00a31.25), and Andrew's breakfast costs \u00a32 (since it's 2 egg-and-a-slice, instead of 3 egg-and-a -slice).\n\n10. Both Dale and Andrew pay a total of \u00a310 extra between the two of them than they should have.

This suggests that the speaker's father bought a car for them, which is possible as a parent could give the child a used car, but is unlikely because the child is old enough (possibly even adult), so such a car would be unnecessary.\n2) \"the neighbors would go out...\" This part does not fit the sentence as the speaker is describing why they own a car. Instead, it is a phrase that can be removed and is not relevant to the sentence's meaning.\n3) \"...which is a great car\" is another phrase that does not fit the context. This can similarly be removed from the sentence as it is not integral to the sentence's logic.\n4) \"I have it\" is redundant as it is already implied by the fact they purchased the car. The speaker is using a clich\u00e9 phrase that is not particularly useful as it does not bring any extra information to the sentence.\n5) In conclusion, the sentence can be revised to be more concise and meaningful. The phrase \"Now I have it?\" can be removed since the meaning can still be understood without it, and the phrase \"which is a great car?\" can also be removed. Finally, \"I have it.\" can be removed as it is redundant. Instead of starting the sentence with a phrase that introduces the problem and conveys the solution in one shot, it is more appropriate to start the sentence with a phrase indicating the problem and end it with a phrase that indicates the solution. By removing the clich\u00e9 phrase, the sentence becomes tighter and more impactful.

Kennedy\u2019s house is then said to be 1000 square feet larger, and we are asked how many square feet Benedikt\u2019s house is. However, in order to answer this question we first need to know how large Benedikt's house is.\n3.

So, A=4.\n4. So: In a day Janice makes use of the elevators: 4 times (because she uses the elevator the rest). In a day, she goes up: 4 flights of stairs, and she goes down: 3 flights of the stairs. Thus, the answer is: 4\u00d73 - 1.\nSo the final answered is: Janice's office is located on the 3rdfloor, so in a single day she has to go up 5 flights. Down the 3 flights, and the elevator the rest. So, in a single day, she walks up and down the 8 flights of stairs. \nInput:How did the man lose weight? Choices:  a: went to bed", "answer": " 24"}

E: looking at the price tags\nOutput: 1.) The question states that 'when someone enters' a shop, they'll most probably be looking around.\n\n2.) The question does not mention a purchase; hence it is a given conclusion that a person entering a shop'most probably' is not intending to purchase anything at that moment.\n\n3.) 'listening to a salesperson' makes no sense as to what they're doing when they enter the shop; hence, it's excluded.\n\n4.)

{"text": "1) First we write everything into a linear equation (x + 50). Then, we solve the first equation, by adding both sides of the equation and distributing both left terms across the minus sign on the right term. The right term on the left side remains the same, so we do not have to add/subtract from it. The left term, on the right side, gets a minus in front of it, so its coefficient and x are swapped, which makes our left hand side equal to 15x. The right hand side is already negative, so its coefficient and 18 are swapped. Finally, we replace all of the negative numbers above with 10- and get: 18 - 10(15x) = x - 10x.\n\n2) If we use the equation from above, and subtract X from both sides, we get X = 18 - 50X + 100.\n\n3) Solving for X will give us 50X = -32 then just minus both sides of this equation.

We know that Conner rides 1/3 of the time on flat terrain, 1/3 on uphil, and 1/3 downhill. So it simply adds up to 1 and the sum of all the other times: 1/3 + 1/3 +1/3 = 1 3) Therefore the number of times the dunebaggy ride on uphil should be 2/3 the number of times it rides on downhill because one of those times should be the same. 4) Then we simply divide the mileage the dunebug rides on uphill by 2 so we get 9 miles per hour 5) Now all we do is add 60+12+9 so we get 97 miles. 6) This means that Conner averages a speed of 97 miles per hour for each total distance Conner has traveled. 7) Then lastly the answer is 97, which is the average speed.\n\nInput: \nIn the middle of a race, there are two runners leading the pack by far.

The amount he wins after winning $100 is $80.\n4. He started off by paying off Colin, whom he owes $20.\n5. Now Ian is paying Colin $40. And Benedict, whom he owes money for, he is paying $10 and so on.\n6. He would have paid off both Benedict and Helen.\n7. $40 goes to Colin, $40 goes to Helen, $20 goes to Benedict, and $20 goes to himself.\n8. $10 is left in his pocket.\n9. The total value of the debts he is paying is $150.\n10. $10 is half of that. So 20 is left before he pays off Benedict.\n11. $40 is to be paid first, so it is doubled. $10 is then paid to Benedict. He should be left with nothing after that.\nSo the final solution is: Dollars left in Ian's pocket=40-10\n\nInput:  The first thing you should never say while walking to a party is what?

But this is an assumption. A fume hood only has air in it and it is the air that is making that blue, not the fumes. \nThen, these 45 drops were added in three different beakers. This means that this 15 drops in 3 beakers and 30 drops in the 5 beakers are going to be added to 8 beakers in total, which is the same number of beakers with copper as the ones without.

{"text": "1. This question is concerned with the number of model trains that Max has from birthday to birthday.\n2. Let\u2019s figure out each birthday and calculate total. Start from the given year.\n3. 2(5) year is 5 x 2 = 10, and he has already asked for 5 trains in these 2 years, hence he asks for 5 more. Sum: 10 + 5 = 15\n4. 1 birthday ago, Max had asked for 5 trains. Hence he should have got 0 train on his previous birthday. This is one way to know that his collection started with zero.\n5. At the end of next year(5th birthday) he gets two doublings, hence total collection now would be 2x(9) = 18. So, his collection from birthday 5 is 15 + 18 = 33\n6. From birthday 6 to 10 he gets 5x0+5x1+5x2+5x3+5x4+5x5 = 0+5+10+15+10+5 = 40 birthday trains. Total collection of train from birthday 6 to birthday 10 will be (33+ 40) = 73\n7. Now at every birthday he gets two doublers. This means total will double as each doubler comes. As per this, next birthday will be 18 + 36 = 54, on 2nd next birthday, he will have 54 + 80 = 134, and on 3rd next birthday, he has 134 + 176 = 310.\n8. Now total collection of trains from birthday 7 to birthday 11(11th birthday) is (54+134 +176+208 +252 +294) = 1556.\n9.

{"text": "1) The question starts by stating that one single pie is priced at $4.\n2) The question then states that one single pie had three pieces, which is inconsistent with stating that all (3) pieces can be sold. Hence, since the single pie has more than 1 (1+3=$4), the 3 pieces are more likely to be 3 parts of a cake or pie than 3 actual discrete pieces. Note, 3 parts of a pie is not the same as 1+2 other pies.\n3) It is mentioned that the bakery is able to make 12 pizzas in one hour and that each piece costs the bakery 0.5$.\n4) It is finally mentioned it should sell all pie pieces.\n5) The question here tries to give information about the income, the problem is that the information is not correct and we don't know the units of the cost nor the units of the money, and we also do not know for example if one piece is sold before creating the next piece.\n6) If we assume a cost of 0.1$ and a sale of 1$ one piece of pie we would have 5$ in 1 hour, and if we create another 20 pies this would add another $25$ to the total income. Note, these examples are incorrect because the actual answer is much closer to 35.\n7) Another approach is to take all the information without assuming cost amounts or units and find a pattern. In this scenario the best possible scenario for the baker is to create the pies and then to sell all 12 pies, because if they create 12 pies after selling 3 pies of the pizzas sold, there would be a loss for the bakery. This could happen if the amount of pizzas created is too high, which should not be the case. From the original question we know that 1 hour is enough for the baker to prepare all the pizzas so, for a complete sale, the bakery would keep 6 pizzas or would spend 50 cents. Since the money is known to be $6, the baker earned $1 dollar of margin per pie.\n8) Note that the last problem is to find the margin per pie in the question 12 * (4 + 0.50", "answer": " 138"}

Lana only eats four because she \"only does three fewer than Jacob\" and since the number of sour balls she eats matches the number of sourballs Jacob has eaten, this means she is only eating 4 candies.\n7: Thus, we can confirm that each person has a bag of 12 sours ball candies that they can all equally share, and each of them gets a total of 12/4 = 3 sour ball candies.\nSo the answer is C: 3\n\nInput: What does the saying \"The cheese stands alone\" mean?

{"text": "1.\"Total earning\" in this question refers to the total amount of money earned from the sale, and not the individual amount earned by each person.\n2. \"Dividing total earning\" in this context means dividing the total amount earned between the two co-sellers, namely Sab and Dane.\n3. By eliminating options C and E, we can ascertain that this question asks us to calculate how much each person earned after the sale (Option B) assuming the sale proceeds were equally divided among the two sellers.\n4. The next step is to calculate the total amount earned by dividing the cost of the items offered for sale by the total number 26 (= 6 x 2 + 18 x 2) of pairs and shirts. \n5. This means that the total amount earned is: $$(0.5 x 6 x 3 + (2 x 18) x 2)$$ or $$5x3$$.\n6. Next, we divide 5 by 2. This gives the ratio, so we find the total amount each person earned as follows: 5/2 x (1/2) * 5 = 7.5 x 5 = 37.50.\n7.

{"text": "1. The question is asking how many apples Layla picked, given some specific information about the quantities of apples the others picked.\n2. Layla also picked some apples, and we need to work out how many of those apples are left to find out how many apples overall Layla picked.\n3. The question specifically mentions that the other two picked an average of 30 apples - this implies that they took into account the apples they themselves picked, so their individual totals would not be equal to 30.\n4. The first thing to do is to subtract the total picked by the first person from the total picked by the averaged total. \n5. There are 40 minus 30, or 10 apples Maggie picked. \n6. So now, we can subtract the total picked by Maggie from the averaged total of the other two. This tells us that Kelsey picked 5 more apples than the average total, so there are 28 minus 30, which means that Kelsey picked one extra apple.\n7. There are now 7 more apples than the averaged total, so Layla must have picked 63.\n8. Summarising all the calculations, the total amount of apples picked by the three is 10 from Maggie, 28 from Kelsey and 63 from Layla. \n9. There would be no need to specify a rounding option.

The final cost of the eggs will be $1.50. 3: Option A is incorrect because it multiplies the number of eggs (60) by the price per dozen ($0.75), resulting in an incorrect answer of $45. 4: Option B is incorrect because it divides the price per dozen ($9) by the number of eggs (12) to get an answer of $0.75. This is incorrect because the question gives us only the number of eggs, and we cannot divide by a number for which there is no given answer. 5: Option C uses the same calculation as Option B but with the answer to the division, which we have not been given in the original calculation. This is incorrect. 6: Option D correctly calculates the total cost of the eggs as $1.50 by multiplying the answer to the original question ($0.50) by 3, resulting in the correct answer of $1.50\nSo the final answer A: ($1.50)\n\n### Instruction:Answer the question with 100 characters or less.\n\n\n### Final Explanation\n\nInput: In a grocery store, I found two cakes.  The small cake costs $5.00.  The large cake costs $12.00. Which cake was cheaper?\nOutput: Given:The two cakes available at the grocery store had one larger cake costing $12.01 and a smaller cake that cost $5.00\n1. The question asks how much cheaper the larger cake was than the smaller cake.\n2. We can see that the larger cake was 69% more expensive than the smaller cake, but the question asks which of the two was cheaper, so we have to subtract the prices to avoid double counting.\n3. The smaller cake is $5 x 0.69 = $3.45 cheaper than the larger cake, which costs $12, so", "answer": " 18"}

For this, the given fact about Dawn is that she have 40 more banana than Lydia. So, Dawn=100+40=140 bananas\n2. If we add Lydia and Dawn we get 100+140=240 bananas\n3. Now we subtract Dawn's bananas from the total we get 240-140=100 bananas\n4. From here we can see that Dawn has 60 banana\n5.

The question asks if the number '1' is greater than or equal to '0'. There are some properties of these numbers that can inform us.\n2. If we consider the relationship between '1' and '2', we can see that for any given real number x, we have x + 1 > x + 2 and any number smaller than '0' that adds 1 will result in some value larger than zero. Therefore, by rule x + 1 > 2 > 0, \n3. We can also consider the relationship between '0' and '1', and see that adding 1 to any number bigger than zero will result in a value smaller than '0'. This can be seen when the number is bigger than 5 since after you add 1 the value is 6. However, when the number is less than 5, \n4. The question asks if it is always true that the number \u20181\u2019 is greater than or equal in value to the number '0'. It can be concluded that such is true, as '1' is greater in value when compared with any number that is smaller than '0'.

Thus, the cost of the flower is $21. \n4. When we have the cost of the flower ($21) we must subtract the price of the flower to the soil ($2). The remaining price is $3. This means that the cost of the flower alone is $21.00 and the cost of the flower + soil is $30.\n5. Combined, the flower + pot costs $31.00 and together the flower + pot + soil costs $51.00. Therefore, the cost of the flowers total is $41.00 + $31.0 = $72.00.\n6. We have now determined that the total cost of the flowers is $72.0. However, we have yet to determine how much to plant.\n7.

{"text": "1) The problem is essentially asking the number of bolts and nuts used for a project. We can restate the problem and the question, using algebra.\n2) Let N be the number of nuts, and B be the number of bolts, then the whole problem can be seen as N + 2B + 6 = 15.\n3) Now, we have the system of one linear equation and two unknowns, i.e. N and B. To find both B and N, we have to use the formula for solving a system of equations.\n4) We can then substitute N for 16 and B for 5, which solves 2 systems of equations with 2 unknowns in only 1. This is because the first system does not contain an N.\n5) As a result, we get that, for each of the 11 boxes, the amount of bolts and nets are equal to N/2 + 3 and N/2 - 1 respectively. Similarly for each box, the number of bolts N1, and the number of nuts N2 equals to N1 + N2 + 4 + 2 for (3) boxes of nuts and N1 + 6 for (3) boxes for bolts.\n6) Hence, N1 = N2 for each of the (3) boxes of bolts and N1 + N2  = 3 for each of the (4) of nuts. This can be simply restated by saying that the number of nuts and bolts is equal to 16 +15.\n7) So, the final answer is B = 5, N = 16\n\nInput: In a 40m by 90m room, there are 40m pieces of wood with a total of 460 meters in a pile. \nHow many meters are used in one piece of wood?

Let's use the variable S to refer to their combined number of cards and the variable R to represent the number of cards left. We first eliminate option C: \"Malcom has 8 fewer cards than Brandon\". This is incorrect because he gave half of the cards he originally had to Mark, which should give Malcom the same number of cards as Brandon.\nNext, \"a total of 12\" should be eliminated, given that Mark and Malcom still have the same number of combined cards in their collections. So if the total of Brandon and Malcom's collections is 20, then S must be 20.\nSince we know that Malcom has R cards and Brandon has S - R cards, we can calculate their difference directly. So S-R is the combined number of cards both Brandon and Malcom had left combined - S-R = 12.\nFrom this, we can further compute R=S - 12.\nTherefore, the answer is B: S - 12 (Brandon and Malcom have (S-12) cards in their collection)\nSo the final answer option is B: S -12\n\nInput:  What is the value of 4 \u00f7 (\u22123) + 2?

{"text": "1 The scenario describes an endeavour undertaken by Javier to raise $96 in order to acquire a new game.\n2. Since the scenario does not provide information on his budget, we can eliminate $2.40 as a potential value of each donut.\n3. The next part mentions that he buys each dozen (12) donuts for $24.\n4. Now we are left with options where we can buy various numbers of dozen donuts or purchase a certain number of donuts. Therefore, option $1:$96: 96 is a lesser value, and cannot be bought in full at once, so it is eliminated.\n5. When purchasing donuts, Javier will have the opportunity of purchasing from multiple suppliers who all may sell in different quantities. The options $2:$60:$10:$96: 60 is too high and there is no need to buy such a large amount of donuts, so it cannot be the answer.\n6. Similarly, the remaining three options all have prices that are too high and hence are not feasible purchases.\n7. Therefore, we can safely assume that option $$2:$$1-$2.40: 28 is likely to be the correct answer.\n8. The next step is to think back to what Javier wants, which is to raise $96 to buy a new game.

{"text": "1.) The question given is asking for answer A. 2.) The question consists of a hypothetical situation in which the temperature of a mountain is currently at 84 degrees and the temperature will decrease by 1 hour. 3.) The scenario is described in relation to a particular moment in time, with a time interval.\n4.) This question can be broken down into two smaller questions. \n5.) The first question asks to estimate what the current temperature of Mountain addison is.\n6.) Therefore, the current temperature of Mountain Addison can be estimated to be around 84 degrees\n7.) The second question asks to estimate the amount by which the temperature will drop.\n8.) In order to do so, the current temperature of the Mountain addison should be established first. \n9.) Thus, the question can be rephrased as: \u201cBy what percentage will the temperature of addison mountain decrease?\"\n10.) In order to calculate this new percentage the question gives us the information needed.\n11.) The given scenario states that, the temperature of the mountain addison decreases by 1 hour.\n12.) Therefore, the question can be answered by dividing the change in the temperature by the time for which it occurs. \n13.) Thus the formula used to calculate the percentage of decrease is (84-72/(84*1)) \n14.) Since the time at which we intend to compare is the next hour, the amount that we divide with will be 1. \n15.) Therefore, by the formula stated above, we get 85-72/85 i.e., -1. \n16.) Then, the percentage of change stated in the question can be simply derived by subtracting two whole numbers then dividing the result to the previous number. \n17.) Thus, the correct answer for this question is -1/84 * 100 = -1.2%. \n\n## How to write a correct Python program?\n\nTo write a correct Python program, one must:  \n- first, carefully study the problem statement;  \n- then, write a well-structured and coherent program that uses clear, readable code;  \n- afterward, test and debug the program to make sure that the correct output is being produced for each unique case presented in the problem.  \nBy carefully crafting your", "answer": " 21"}

Hence, 25% times 16 = 4 yards and 2 times 16 =40 yards.\n5, Thus, out of the option of 2, 4, 8 and 16, the correct answer is 4 yards as compared to Parker.\nSo the final answers is: A: 4 yards", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "1 Let us take an example of three persons. Say person A has $10, B has $0, C has $10\n2. If A gives B and C $3, B will have $3, C will have $7. Lets say person A also has X and person B has X+3, person C will have X+3+Y.\n3. In this example, if A gives 5 to b and c it will give an additional 5 to C. So the total amount given by A to b and c is 5.\n4. Now if A and B will have same amount, we need to subtract the amount which A gave to B. The difference B will have 2. SO it is B that has 2 more than the original amount when A gives 5 to B and C.\n5. Now if B gives 2 he will have 2-2=0. So original A had 10 and B had 0. So in one transaction they will have balance amount 10.\n6. If B gives 2 to C also 2-2. Hence B gave 2 and C got 7. So the amount C had earlier is 2.\n7. Now if A gave 5 to B and 2 to C, B will have 2 more than he had initially. So A gave 5 and B had 2 more than original.\n8. So the amount A had is 10-2=8. C had 2 more than the total money which A had.\n9. If A had 8 and B 2 more. Then B is going to have 10. SO C will have $2 to start with.\n10. In one step A+B=A+C. SO initial A+B+C=10+2+2.

{"text": "1) The question asks for the number of flowers blooming because of a unicorns trip through the Enchanted Forest as part of six. We determine the flower count by considering the flowers that are created by each unicorn's trip.\n2) We know that the unicorn walks 24 m forward per step. This means that each unicorn goes 1.5 kilometers when it walks 9 km.\n3) With six unicorns moving forward in one group, they will go through 3.6 kilometers. Each unicorn will travel through 600 meters.\n4) The question gives the total distance each unicorn can travel (600 meters) and the total distance each unleap will cover (3.6 kilometers). This means that each step will yield enough unicorn leaps to cover the total distance needed to travel through the Enchanted forest.

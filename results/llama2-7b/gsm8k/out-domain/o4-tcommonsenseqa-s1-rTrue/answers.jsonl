What is the value of 25 divided by n?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A number n is 1 more than 4 times another numbr m.\nRationales: We know that when we divide two numbers of equal denominators: a*b = (n +1)* m, therefore b=n+1 and b*n=1+4m. Now n*m= n+1*m and b* n=1+4m  => n+1*m= b*n   , n+1=b. From that we can find n=b-1. Therefore, n = 4*m-1.\n\nNow we take 25/n = 25 divided by the number n that is 4m-1\nTherefore 25/ 4m \u2013 1 = 25/4m= 25\n\nSince we know the m*b=1 then 25*m = 100 Therefore 25 = 100/4=25\nSince n = n-1, then n=4*m-1=m+4 so we can take 4-1= -3 => 4*m-3 = 5*m-2 =m*3\n\nTherefore 26/4m =100 = 50/2m = 10/4\n\nThe number the 25 divided by is equal 50.\n\nAnswer: 50\n\n### Citing:https://www.mheducation.com/toppers/solution/c2p6-sol-tos2.pdf\n\n### Input A number n is 2 more than 4 times the number m.

Therefore, we have to calculate the total cost.\n\nTo start, we calculate Dale's total cost to make sure that we're on the right track. From the given choices, we know that he had 2 slicess, so we can substitute in 2 in the toast option with a price of \u00a31, which tells us that it costs \u00a32 for Dale. We also know that he had 3 eggs, which gives us 2 eggs x \u00a33, thus telling us Dale's total breakfast cost is \u00a34.\n\nNow that we know that Dale's total is \u00a34, we can subtract 4 from the total of 6 to give us the total cost for Andrew's breakfast.

He increases his weight, and then 1.5 times that weight, and then he is able to find a buyer to sell the cow to. The value of the cow increases in each instance.  It's the same in this case.\n\n### Rationale: \nAnswer: The cow increased its weight in two steps, from 400 to 600 pounds to then 900 pounds.  For each of these jumps in weight, its value increased 50%.  John's cow went up from $4 per pound initially to $12 per pound at its final weight.

She doesn't actually have the option to only have one inch of fish in both containers. So, she has a choice of keeping either two-inch or three-inch fish in one tank.\n\n#### Solution Method:\n\n##### Example 1:\n\n* The first gallon of water is used by fish, resulting in loss of 9 gallons of water\n* The second gallon of water is not used by fish, resulting loss of 8 gallons of water\n\nIn the first example, she only has three-inch fish. The next example will be two-inch fish\n\n##### Example2:\n\n* The second gallons of water is used by two-inch fish, resulting in loss 8 gallons of\n* The fifth gallon of water is lost by a one-inch fish, resulting to loss of 7 gallons of water.\n\nIt turns out that, she has only two-inch fish.\n\n##### Final Answer:\n\nSo, in Example1 and example2, each inch fish takes 9 gallons of fish and Example 3 takes 8 gallons of fish, so the net water lost are 27 gallons. We know that we have to multiply 27 with (2 X 2) to answer 56 gallons of water lost. This means, we will have three inch remaining in the second tank, whereas the first tank will have four-inch fish.\nAfter adding three-inch to fish left, the net water lost would be (0/1) gallons. So, at the end, she would have to take a number of three inch fish from the first tank. However, the question doesn't mention whether she have to replace the fish she just took out. \nIn Conclusion, the answer is to take one fish out.\n\n**Reference Question:**  [415764351](https://i.stack.imgur.com/415765351.png)", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Answer 91\n\nAnswer:\n1. 25\n2. 19\n3. 21\n4. 12\n5. 27\n6. 31\n\n### Rationale: I'll use the car count method to solve.\n\n1. On Monday, there are 20% less cars on Happy Street than on Tuesday. This means that on Monday 1/4 of cars (20%) will be taken away from the starting amount. That means for Monday, we had 49% of cars.\n2. On Tuesday, it's 49% of 59%. This means 49% of (49% of 25)=25.\n3. But you want more than just Tuesday. Let's make this a loop.\n4. This means you now have 49% of x = 49% of(49% of 19)=15.5 cars.\n5. For wednesday, it's the same 49% of something like 49% of the remaining amount from Tuesday, and this time is 49% of Tues: 49% of25.\n\n### If there was only traffic on Mon-Tue-Wed: I would simply keep going in this loop until the next day of traffic.\n\n6. Now, let's do Thursday and Friday. These are similar because traffic is the same for those days. This is because if the remaining amount on Wednesday(45) was enough for both Thursday and Friday for 49%, it would be enough to do three, so Friday's traffic would stay as a 5 car count, and we can ignore that. So on Thursday, traffic will stay as 14 for Thursday, then 15.5 for Friday.\n7. What about Saturday? Well, we had 25 cars on Tuesday. Then as we go by, traffic gets smaller and smaller by the day since we're going by in a loop. So for Saturday, traffic only has the 4 cars left in it from Tuesday. 25-10=15, 25-15=10, 25-20=5, 25", "answer": " 97"}

{"text": "The difference in price per can is (48/12) \u2013 (12/12)\n\n1. First, we do a little subtraction on the 6.00 that the local grocery store in charging per can and the 12.00 the bulk warehouse is charging per case. We see that the warehouse is chargen 300 cents more per case than the grocery store. We then realize that when you have a can, in a box of 12, you are probably using all 12 so we multiply that by 12 as well. That comes out to [(12.00-12.00)+(12.00*12)] = 600 cents, or $6.00.\n\n2. Now we have both prices so we have [((48/12)-(12/12))+600]] so the equation breaks down to [(48/12)+600] so we need to multiply [(48/1)] by [12, as before]\n\n3. Which works out to be the [4-case] 480 \u00f7 12\n4. So to arrive at the overall amount difference at the grocery shop over the warehouse, we would have to subtract that answer by six which would give us the 690, so when you multiply to price difference per can we see that the difference per can is (4.8-6.0) which is 1.2.\n\nOutput: 1.2$ a Can\n\n### Input 38$\n\n### Solution 38 Dollars\n\n### Input:-6\n\n### Solution:-6 is the difference.\n\n### Input:(38-6)\n\n### Solution:\n\n### Input (65-6)\n\nOutput: 65 Dollars\n\n#Input: (40-23)-17\n\nOutput: 39\n\nInput:\n```\n13/8 = 1 5/8\n13 \u2013 1 5/16 = 8/16\n8/16 = 1/2\n```", "answer": " 25"}

But if you do 5 * 1 plus 20 * 3 plus 5 * 1, you will get 1+9+5=15.\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThe question specifies that for 5 minutes, the first cat meows 3 times per 60 minutes. The second cat meows twice as frequently as the 1st, so 3 times per 30 minutes, and the third cat meows at one-third the rate of 2nd cat = 1/60, which is 1/10 minutes.\n\nFirst we start with the 2nd cat. 30 Minutes is 3/60 Minutes, so that means if we start the 2:30 Min mark then 3/60 * 2 hours = 1/10 cat meow.\n\nNow we have the second time, the 3rd cat meowing. We start this time at the 3:60 mark, so the 3/60 part is the same as above, but then we multiple that by 1/10 of the full hour, so this is 1/60. So we add the 3/6- the 2/3 and we have 3/60 = 1/15 (cat meows).\n\nThis lasts a full hour, so we add 5 1/15s together and we have our answer = 15 cat meows.\n\n## Contributors\n\n- [Brand New Guru](https://github.com/BrandNewGuru)", "answer": " 55"}

The question assumes, given that a problem, 'If 3 * 4 = 12, then 3 * 4 + x ='\n3.'x' indicates that our unknown quantity is 1, because otherwise, the question does not make sense.\n4. The question asks that we solve for x, so we divide by 3 to calculate x.\n5. We know that 3 * 4 equals 12, so 3*(4 + 1) = 15, meaning that x must be 15.\n6. Our unknown x = 15, because the product of all terms except x is 27 and the constant term is 1.\n7. Therefore the answer is 350 because \"3 * 5 = x * (3 * 5 +1) = 350.\"\n\n### Inputs for part 4:\n\n### This is John's recipe for a delicious apple pie.\n\n4. This is John's apple pie recipe.\n5.

We can determine this because the question tells us so. The question also states that he was waiting for a specific response, which was a'response'.\n\nThe person who wanted a response may have called out or they may not have said anything to the person they wanted a response from. The fact that the response was expected tells us that the person called out to the person they wanted the response from. This means that the person calling out could do something other than call out to the person.\n\nSo the response could be a call back, a letter, or the person could be expected to do something else.

We are asked to determine what his average speed would be in miles per hour. \n\nWe can start by breaking down the 1/3:1/3:1 rule we are given:  3(flat) + 3(down) + 3(up) = 90\n(downhill travel being twice as fast as flat travel, and travel on uphill slope being half as fast as travel on flat travel)  60 + 12 + 18 = 90\nSo we can substitute 60 for 90 in this equation:\nSo we can start by substituting the 60 into 60 + 18 + 12 = 80\nSo 60 = 80 - 18 = 62, then 62 = 62 - 12 = 50\nSo 62 is the amount of miles per hour Conner can travel on the flat sand.\nNext, we can substitute the 12 into 62 + 18, so we can just substitute 70 for 80:\nSo 60 + 70 = 130 miles per hour \nSo, Conner can travel 60 miles per hours on flat sand. \nSo now we know the amount of miles per hours Conner can travel on flat sand: 60, Next, we can substitute the -18 into 60 + -18. We now know one answer: 72 miles per hour. Next, we can do the above substitions, using our original variables (downhill + 60 = 128). Next, we can do 18 18 12 72 = 21 miles per hour.

{"text": "Max has 55 trains now.\n\n### Rationale:\nStep 1: Let's assume Max always got the same answer for his gifts.  In this case, Max always gets 6 gifts a year for 5 years, totaling 30 gifts in 5 years.  If this is so, we can solve it as a simple math problem.  Each year, Max asks for 2 gifts and Max always gets what he wants, so that means he has double each year.  55/2 = 27 and 27 + 27 = 54 and since it is a multiple of 2, we add 1 more.\nStep 2: Since Max always got this answer for his gift requests in the beginning, we can't really change what he asks for, right?  If Max always asked for 2 gifts, he would continue to ask for the same number.\nStep 3: This means Max always got the same set of trains.  If Max only got 2 trains in the beginning and kept adding on the same number each of the next 5 years, he would have 28 trains total after 5 years.  \nSo, Max originally got only a small number of trains and added 1 more train each year.  We know he ended on more the original amount - 55 - than he started with at the beginning - 28.\nStep 4: Max's original amount of trains = 28.  If that is the case, then his final amount would be 54 x 2 = 108.  Then we add one to get to 109 or 55.

His number of pills is increasing or decreasing based on each day, and as such, the final number of pills in the bottle cannot be determined by taking a single serving.\n\n5.)

{"text": "$37 + $5/4 = 8 dollars more than the 20 roses because they cost more and there are twice as many lillies as roses\n### Rationales: First, we have to define what we are being asked to solve for. The question is asking us to calculate the total cost of all the flowers.\n2.Next, we will break down the information being given in the question. We are told that Nadia purchased 20 roses, and she also bought 3/4 times more lilies than roses. We can simplify this because 3/4 is the same as 3/4 x 4 = 3. This means we have 20 roses that are 3 times better than lilies, so she is buying roses 3 to 4 times better than lililies. We can also see that the cost of roses is 5$ and the cost of lilies is 10$.\n3.We will subtract the cost of roses from the cost of lilils to work backwards to determine the answer. After subtracting 20 x 5$ we have 60$, subtracted from (3 x lilies cost per rose)- 10$ =(9x$10$), which is 90$. However, we have 15 lilies total meaning the cost for a lily is 5 dollars, so the last portion of the cost is (2 x 5$) + (1 x 5$) = 10$, which is 105$.\n4.The cost for each flower added up is 305$, which equates to 60 + 90 + 105 = $ 305 dollars. This answer choice, when simplified (60 + 9 10) + 105/4 = $37 + 5/4, equating to 8 dollars more than 20 roses.\n5. Therefore, the answer choice is B: $37 + 8 dollars = $ 45.The price for 20 roses is $ 100, giving us the cost for the extra lillies of 55 dollars.\nAnswer: B $37 + 45$", "answer": " 250"}

Examine each of the options and find an answer that best fits with the question.\n2. Option A \u201cnew buses\u201d doesn\u2019t make sense because they will introduce a completely different station next to the bus station. The buses cannot come from the same location as the current bus station. So, they will have no place to leave from. \n3. The bus station is under construction. Therefore, option B \u201cImprovement in Performance\u201d can\u2019t be the answer since performance won\u2019t matter until the station is finished.\n4. Option C \u201cReduction in fare rates\u201d. The station is being built, so nothing will be going on there for some time. They wouldn\u2019t need to reduce fare rates, even if that was a good thing to do. \n5. Option D \u201cReduction of waiting times\u201d. Waiting times won\u2019t reduce because construction will likely be adding traffic to the area. If anything, waiting times will increase.\n6. The question asks what can\u2019t be the first service which means that there can only be one answer, so the answer is F: No new can\u2019t be a service, so that can\u2019t be the right answer.\n7. We have eliminated the wrong answers and only 1 answer is left. \n8. The answer that we'll likely find to be the best match is E: Change in routes.\n9. The new station will take traffic from the current station and so it will definitely create changes to the routes that previous buses were taking.\n10.

There are babies in 35 minks and each has 6.\n\n### Solution\n\nYou can have a total of 7. But why?\n\nLet's go in order, the 30 minks are supposed to cover the amount of 30 minking skins you bought. What is 30 minkinks, 210minks because there are 2 sets of 6 minks in every set.\n\nNext, you can have a total of half. You have to divide by 2 because you have 90 minks now which are 10 over 20 so you have one more. That's the first half.\n\nFinally, it says if half is freed. What does that mean? Well 5.5 is the average amount of babies you get from 5 6 7. \nSo that is the first half of babies, but there is a certain amount of half you get, so 2.\n\nWith this, we have 2.5, 6-2.5 = 3.5 left.

{"text": "As you have provided, we can first solve for the number of miles paved on a single day before moving to the second day. \nThere appears to be a misconception in answer choice E - \"three\" because this is incorrect. It seems that it is missing a factor of 5. \nIf there are 3 truck fulls of asphalt per mile, then each truck needs 300,000 parts of gravel, pitch, etc. \nThere are 16 miles of road, and there are 3 trunks of asphalt per 16 mile, thus 300,100 parts of asphalt are needed per day.  \nMultiply it by five, and that is 1,500,500 parts of graves/pitch. \nDeduct 300,505 parts, and you get 1,199,995 parts of graves/pritch.  \nThus, the solution for the first day is part E: \"twelve thousand nine hundred and ninety nine parts\"\n\nOn the second day, we have 1,089,473 parts of graves/ pritch. We have 13,265 (900 - (263 parts of barrels)) barrels of pitch; therefore, we have a new amount of parts of graves/ pitch of 1,102,737. \nThe third day, we can solve for this based on the information that we have. We need to solve for the original amount, and then we subtract all the barrels of pitch we had from each day before.\nThe amount from the original day, which is equal to 1,190 995 parts. Subtracting these 3 days worth of barrels, we subtract 13,219 from 1,194 074. The new amount is 1,180,855 parts. \nBased on 13,289 barrels of pitch divided by 128 (barrels / pitch), we need 100 parts to finish the road.

Bob does not only have brothers, so he doesn't have the fewest brothers.\n2. Sue doesn't have the most brothers or the fewest, she's in the third position.\n3. Bob is the last person to be described.

{"text": "You can buy the bike you want with $220 in total.\n\nInput: What kind of job does not require a lot of patience? Choices: 1: cook 2: teacher 3: writer 4: firefighter 5: photographer\nRationales: This answer can be reasoned out by looking at the options and understanding how patience plays out. Let's look at the jobs and how patience is important in our evaluation.\n1. \"Cook\" requires good patience to deal with a hot kitchen and a short fuse.  Patience is required when cooking for the food is either bad or if it takes too long to finish your order.\n2. \"Teacher\" requires excellent patience as students are in the way and are very active. If you do not show patience, you have a high risk of losing control of your class.\n3. \"Writer\" doesn't have much to do with patience. They need concentration to focus on their work and time to write what they want for their work.\n4. \"Firefighter\" requires patience to stay calm since there are so many active fires and accidents that you need to deal with. You are always stressed and always nervous. If you do not remain calm, they might die or lose their life.\n5. \"Photographer\" requires patience to wait for the right shot. It takes time if you miss it. You need to wait until the light is right and the moment that you want to capture. If you do not, you will have taken a wrong shot and need to retake it again. If you have no patience, you cannot take photography.\nOverall, the best answer would be (2) \"Teacher\" because this option has patience involved. Being a teacher requires you to teach while showing patience to your students.\nAnswer: (2) Teacher\n\n### Input (answer): Who are you going to see this summer?\n\n### Demetrios' response: I am going to see my aunt in France on a two-week trip this summer.

{"text": "Answer: D. Three pieces\n### Rationale: 1. The statement of the whole problem states: \"Timothy has $55 to spend at the souvenir shop.\" According to the statement, this problem requires that Timothy must spend all the $50 that he has, therefore a total amount of $100 must be used to purchase all the key chains, including the three pieces that will be purchased.\n2. The options are: Choices: A. None, b. 2, c. 4, d. 6, e. 8\n3. Since $100 is the total monetary that Timothy can use, and $8 is the cost of each t-shirt, he can only purchase 2 t-shirt items with the $50 that is left in his wallet. This means that the key chains must be purchased with the other $25. 4. Since the $25 is used for the key chains, $25 is the total amount that can be used for the key chaine; this means that option b is the best solution. 5. Timothy can spend $25, a total of 3 key chains will be purchased, option c is therefore the best choice. This is according to the option for d, but the key chain prices must be used in order for Timothy to purchase all the key chain items. A total of $25 will be used for the purchase of three key chain items, this is not enough for a total 8 key chain items and therefore option b is the best choice. 6. Therefore, the options that are left as the best options are choices b and d.\n\n### Input The United States used to have a president who had two nicknames: Old Hickory and Old Public Functionary 2.

{"text": "The sum of Megan's books + Greg's books + Kelcie's books = Books\n\n### Reasoning:The question can be converted into an algebraic equation. First, we need the unknown number of books Megan, Kelcie and Greg have read in total. This number is represented as X in the equation.\nSecond, we can plug in the numbers and calculate the number of books Megan has read this year.\nWe can do this by finding the product of Megan's number of books and the number of books Kelcie reads less than Megan reads this year: 32 x 4 = 84 books.\nThird, we can then find the product of Megan plus Greg together minus Kelcie's 84: 32 +9 =213\nFinally, we can add up all three of these products to get the sum of Megan, Greg, and Kelcie's books read.

Choices:  A : 1,000 B : 10,000 C : 100,000 D : 1,048,576 E : 1000\nRationales:1. It is easy to see that the equation has no solutions for any positive real numbers if $x <.0039$. One easy way to come to this conclusion is by considering the numbers involved. For example, 401,060 > x^10 is obvious because $x^10$ is greater than a sum of a large number of small numbers. Furthermore, x > 0.0003 is true too because x/log10 < 401,956/log10 (401,960- 416/7). By using the above, we see that $x <.0394$. Given that $x >.0003$ which leads to 0.9001 < $x < 1$ which implies that $x^10 < 1000$. So, x is between 0.0039 and 0.901 and that puts both 0 and 1 out. We now know that $x ^10 < 4$, and with that, we are able to see that x is between 0 and 0.9 for it to be larger than 4. 2. It is easy to confirm that 400 > 4. Since 400 is a natural number and it falls into 400 < 411, it will be correct in this scenario. 3. This solution, however, is not as simple as other solutions. To see whether $x^10<401,000$ is feasible, we need to consider how $x^10= 2", "answer": " 12"}

To read an equal number she needs to read one book at a faster rate. Also, If Yasna wants both books to read within a matter of two weeks, it must mean that she needs to read an equal number each day so she needs to finish both by Monday.

It does not necessarily mean starving or being overweight, just missing a certain food as a result of not eating for a long time.\n6.

In the previous answer, there were two fractions: ( 7/  3 ) and ( 7/  4 ).\n\nThe first fraction shows us that we will divide 'n' into seven equal parts like 7 = 7/ 1. \n\nThe second fraction shows us that we divide n into four equal parts like 7= 7/ 4. There are then several ways to calculate the lowest of the two fractions. One of the methods would entail multiplying the first fraction by four, and the second fraction by three.\n\nFrom there, you would then add the two answers to find the lowest whole number with a decimal. Therefore, the answer would be 5/ 12.\n\nThe answer you got is correct.  \n\n### Instuctors Note 2: Answer in your own words.\n\nTo find the lowest whole number that has a decimal part different than zero, you should begin by dividing the whole number by four, and finding the remainder. \n\nFor instance, if I have 37, I would first divide it by 4; thus, resulting in 9. \n\nSince 9 is the remainder, I know that my answer is divisible by four.\n\nNext, I would divide by two. Since the answer is already divisible to four, I can be certain that the answer is divisible by two as well.\n\nFinally, I would divide by three, since 3/2= 1.5 and since 1.5 is already divisible by two, I would know that the whole number is divisible by 3. \n\nThis", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "Alyssa and Abilail need an additional 37 empty cans for 100 cans.\n\n### Rationale: The first equation is: A - 30 = 70 - B The second equation is: A - B = 70 - 43 From the first equation, we would have Alyssa's cans remaining and the new number for the second equation. From the second equation, we would have one new number for the first equation and zero for Alyssa' and Abigail's cans. Since the first equation was subtracted, Abigail's number is 0, we would have to subtract seven since Alyssa already picked that number of cans out of Abigail's pile. We would need an addition of seven for each number left in both equations. The first number in the first equation will be Alyssa' pile minus her picked amount (7). The second number will be Abigail's total cans minus the first equation's second number (7). These two numbers will have to be summed to become Alyssa' missing number to complete the science project. The result of the summation will be the Alyssa' needed for the science project to be completed.\n\n### Input What is the name of the capital of the United states state of Tennessee?\n\n#### Instruction: What is the name of?

Which of the following could describe how much work that the person does in an hour? Choices: 1. D: 12.00 2. E: 2.00 3. G: 1/2hr 4. F: 60.0 5. A: 2.0 6. B: 2.0/hr\nRationales:\n1. The answer given in the response is 12.0. This answer is reasonable because they use 2.0 to describe the wage per minute and then multiply the wage by 60 minutes to get 12.0 as the total dollar earned for the hour.\n2. 60 minutes would not describe how much work that Harry does. If he worked for 60 minutes in the one hour given, then he would not be making any money because he would only have worked for 60 whole minutes, yet the question says he makes $2.00 per minute worked\n3. 2.0/hour means one would be making $0.20 in one hour of work. It is illogical since Harry's pay rate is $2.00/minute, not per hour.\n4. 0.6 is not a reasonable answer. Even though 20/365 is exactly 0.6, it would have to remain as 0.6 and not 1/2hr, because 0.6 is a percentage and can therefore not be described as an hour.\n5. The answer cannot be 2.0/60.

The phrase \"1/7 of the **cost** of a table\" tells us that we are supposed to find the price of a table and use 1/7 of that as the cost of a single chair for 4 chairs.\n2. The question does not ask about buying a table and having 4 chairs delivered. It asks how much it would cost to purchase a table and chairs.\n\n3. So, we can eliminate answer choices A, C, and D since they would result in the purchase and delivery. \n4. Answer choice B refers to a table costing $140, leaving us with $140/7, the price of one chair for 4 chaires.\n5. There is no unit of measurement mentioned in the question in reference to chairs or any other furniture item. A chair, according to Merriam Webster Dictionary, doesn't necessarily mean a chair with four legs. It could be any type of chair, so it can't be measured by having four legs.\n6.

Or are you sure?\n\n### Reproduction/Justification:\n#### Correct Answer Method #1:\n\n1. We know that $3 worth of ingredients is used to make 20 bags.\n2. Each bag costs $3.00 total, so $3 + $1.00 profit = $4.00 per bag.\n3. One bag is sold for $6.0 or $6.00 - $4.00 = $2.00 profit per bag.\n4. $2.00 x 15 = $30.00, so Elizabeth makes that much before being forced to put 5 bags down.\n5. 5 bags down = $20.00, which means $30.0 + $20.0 = $50.00, or $2.00 left over.\n\n### Correct Answer Method #2:\n\n1. There are 3 of each ingredient and total cost for all 3 ingredients = $9.00\na.  $6.00 price tag = $2.0 profit per bag\nb.  $2.00 - $1.00 = $1.00 of profit after selling 20 bags\nc. This left for sale 5 bags\nd. To sell 5 of the bags for $4.00 each -  $4.00 x 5 = $20.

{"text": "The government will need to fence each side of the flower bed, so the total amount of square meters of fencing that will be needed would be: (4 meters)\u00d7(4 meters)=20 square meters.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Firstly, the flower bed is 4 meters wide, and 1 meter less than its width is 3 meters.\n\n2. After that, the flower bed is rectangular in shape, so the length and width are equal. The length is 3 meters plus 1 and they will find the fences.\n\n3. The government will need to enclose the property with fencing which will consist of multiple fence segments.\n\n4. Let's start with the length of the fence that will run down one side of the flower bed. The flower bed is 3 meters wide and thus the fence that runs down one of the sides will be 3 meters long.\n\n5. The flower bed is rectangular, so the total length is equal to 2*length.\n\n6. Therefore, The Government needs to construct fence segments that are 1 meter plus each 3-meter long fence segment. We will need to know what the length of the side of the flower bed is to figure out the number of fence segments that will be needed. This is the area that is being fenced with a side of 3 meters.\n7. Let's multiply a whole and 3 which give the value of 2 which is the total of the sides of the flower bed are three meters.\n\n8. We will need to subtract 1 meter from each fencing to account for the 1-meter separation between flower beds. \n\n9. The length of the fence is 1 meter plus each fence segment that is 3 meters long. To find out how many fences are needed, we will simply multiply 3 meters by the length of the flower bed (i.e., 1 meter longer).\n\n10. The answer to the question is: the 80 square meters which is the result of multiplying fences that are 3 meters long by the flower bed's width of 4 meters.\nTherefore, the government will need 80 square meters worth of fence to fence each side.\n\n### Input\n\nInput: How many different three digit numbers that can be made from", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "Tom swims for two hours at a speed of two miles per hour, then runs for half the remaining time at a speed of four miles per hour.  After this, Tom has covered fifty-three miles in total.\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question gives us specific information about Tommy's speed and duration, which means we need to analyze them independently and add them together since both cannot be multiplied together or divided by each other.\nThe first thing we know is that Tommy swims for two hours.  This gives us a total swimming distance of two miles.\nNext, while Tommy swims during the first two hours, there is a remaining duration of 2 - 2 = 1 hours that Tommy did not spend swimming, which is where the running begins.\nThis remaining time is exactly half of two hours, so the remaining time is 1 hour.\nThis means that Tommy runs for one hour, in which he runs a total distance of 4 x 1 = 4 miles.\nThen, we combine the results from his swimming and running.  Tommy swims for 2 miles in the first two hours, and runs 4 miles in the last 1 hour.\n4 miles + 2 miles = 6 miles in total.  Combining the results, Tommy travels a total distance of 6 miles.\n\n### Input:`Cross the streams.`\n\n### Demostration:First, let's understand and eliminate the logical fallacies that are often used here.\n1. **Begging the question**:This often appears in the form of \"if this is true, then this should be (or should not be) true.\"\n2. **False dichotomy**:This often appears as, \"you can do one thing and not do other things.\"\n3. **False dilemma**:This often appears, as, \"you can only do one of two things and never both.\"\n4. **Appeal to popularity**:This often appears with, \"it will benefit everyone so everyone will want it.\"\n\n5.

First we need to clarify each option on the question.\n2. \"Adding water\" is not the first step in a general recipe, since this is a process that usually happens at the end, after the dish has been fully cooked. It is not the first step of a recipe because preparing a dish requires more ingredients than water. \n3.\"Cooking\" is the process of preparing food by heating it. It is not the initial stage of the process, as it usually starts off with washing the food you are preparing. \n4. \"Washing\" may not be the first \"step\" in a recipe, but it is the foundation of preparing any dish.

Choices: 16 miles, 12, 6, and 7.\nRationales: From the wording of the question, we can infer that the car took a straight path along two roads. It could be a race to the finish line, or simply taking the car on a test drive around a city, but with a goal of going exactly 61 miles. \nIn this scenario, we have to figure out how many miles the car would have driven had it been going at the speed limit instead of below it. Then, by simple math, we can simply subtract that number from 61 to find out how many miles the driver may have driven below the speed limit. \nThere are 3 possible scenarios that could result in 61 miles, assuming the driver was driving steadily and straight. \nAnswer Choice A - The car would have driven for 16 miles at the speed limit.\nWe can conclude this based on the question where the car went 61 total miles, and also would have gone 16 miles at speed limit, meaning it must have gone 45 miles under speed limit.\nAnswer Choice B - The car would have gone for 12 miles at speed limit.\nWe could come to this answer via the same logic as previous answer choice. If we know the car went somewhere between 16 and 45 miles under the speed limit we could simply subtract it from the total trip of 61 to find the 12.\nAnswer Choice C - The car would have walked for 6 miles.\nThis is not a possible scenario in the context of this question. The only realistic answer options are driving or staying home.\nAnswer Choice D - The car would have traveled exactly 7 miles at the speed limit, meaning the car would not have driven less than the speed limit, or not traveled 45 total miles. \nThe only reasonable scenarios are driving steadily for 12 miles, or not going anywhere at all.\nThis leaves the correct answer to be answer choice D: 7.\nAnswer: B.7\n\n### Input 1:\nI was born on December 8", "answer": " 50"}

We know that each car is worth 1 seat on average, and Lana watched the play with her 3 friends.\n4.

{"text": "Jane played 10 rounds of the card game.\n\n### Justification:\n\n1. First, you must understand the gameplay and rules of the card game to solve this problem. The question states that winning a round nets you 10 points. With that known, you need only understand how you are awarded points in the game.\n2. Next, the question tells you that in playing the game, Jane ended up with 60 overall points, that is \"two rounds\" of 10 points or four rounds.\n3. You must understand that a round is a distinct period of card play. Therefore, this means that there are multiple rounds of card play, as indicated by the 2 rounds and four rounds.\n4. Now, you must understand the rules of the game to figure out what a \"round\" is or contains. \n5. The game doesn't say how Jane won the points, so we can't assume that she won because she had the game's best hand in the round.\n6. In the round, there must be some sort of reward based on that round, and you need only to figure out that it was 10 points.\n7. There could be many different actions that could earn you 10 points in the round, such as calling out Bingo, or naming a celebrity or answer to a trivia question.\n8. Since the other players are also in a round and Jane ends up with 10 points at the end, it means that she called out Bingo.\n9. We know Bingo has to be the action that gets you 10 points for that round, and we can assume that there are multiple rounes.\n10.

{"text": "Lavinia\u2019s Son is $4$ years older than her daughter. Thus, her son age is $14$.\n\n### Demand: The question tells us that Katie\u2019s daughter (the younger of two daughters), is 12 years of age. Katie\u2019s daughter must therefore be younger than Lavinia\u2019 s daughter, who is referred to as the \"mother\u2019s daughter\". The younger child is therefore Lavinia\u2019s younger daughter.\n\n### Rationale: First, the question states that Lavinia\u2019s older son, is 2 times the older than Lavinia's daughter. We are given that Lavinia\u2019 s younger daughter is 10 times younger than Katie's younger daughter. We first need to simplify before applying the order of operations. To do so, we use the distributive property. This means that we multiply the term $2$ times the term $X$ times $5$. So, we multiply $2 \\times 5$. In other words, to distribute, we can multiply each individual term by the number before the parenthesis. The simplified equation is therefore $10x$. Next, we divide the two terms. Doing so, we have $x$ dividing by one. Therefore, dividing 10x by 10 is essentially just dividing $x$ by $x$. This reduces to $x = 1$. This means that the mother\u2019s son was $10x$ times older than the younger child. Now that we know the value of $x$ as 1, we can plug into the equation of 10x. The finalized equation is $10x = 2x$. Solving for x gives $x = 5$. We then apply the distributive property, multiplying both sides by 5. The new equation becomes 50 = 10x. Factoring the 5 out of 10 gives 5x = 10. Since $x$ can only take numerical values, the equation reduces to $5 = 1$, which gives $1$ as the answer.\n\n### Answer: 1\n\nInput: In how many ways can four black cubes and two red cubes be placed into a bin if three or fewer black cubes appear in a row?

As stated before there are 2 problems being addressed. If this were true, all of the alligators would have to live together in Paul's home, which is not logical.\n\nThis can also not be the answer, as the question also mentions there are 6 other alligators going with Paul. This information is not needed nor is it valid to the conclusion stated in the premises\n\nThis can not also be the correct answer. Because while Paul took 4 hours to go the first time from the River Nile to Nile Delta in the first part, he came back with more time in the second part of the question. \n\nThis can be false because there are too many alligators, thus the equation should be multiplied by 6. Paul would need to multiply the first trip by 6. And this makes the total time 24 hours, while the question asks for 29.\n\nFinally, we come to the final answer, the correct answer is choice C. \n\nPaul went 4 hours going one way and 2 hours traveling back. Therefore he would have gone 6 hours going one way. If we multiply that by 6 (the other alligators), then we would have 36 hours total. It therefore would add up to 44.

{"text": "$400 (400 USD)\n\n### Dem:In-context\n\n1. $400 = $40 * 12 - (1.05 * 10) - (1.00 * 10)\n2. $400= $40 * 32 - (2.10 * 10). The answer should follow as $40 * 21 + $0 = $820.\n3. In the question, there was no mention of the tickets being multiples of $10.\n4. You can solve the sub-problems using either the \"rounding\" method, or directly solving the first \"40\" tickets as $400 = 2*20 + 10*4 - (2.1*10).\n5. $290 = 2*10 + 10*(4) - 5. This is a little easier by rounding, however. The method of finding a specific ticket price that is more than $10 but less than $20 is not in the realm of this question. \n6. $400(approx.) = 40(20) - (2.1)(20): you can simplify this into $40(2X20) - (8.2)(20):  which in turn simplifies down to $80(X20) - 164(4): you can then round down 190 to be 180, and so on.\n\n\n### Inst:Answer the following fraction math question.\n\n\n## Dem:In-context;\n\n1. The first step would be to identify what could be done in terms of equivalent ratios. The answer choice options are in terms of whole numbers, so the method of fraction elimination won't likely work here. \n2. Fractions with the same numerator can be converted to equivalent ratios (and equivalent fractions): 1/4 = 1/2 + 1/2 = 4/4. Fractions will need to be reduced to lowest form before using this method. For instance, 2/3 is reduced to 2/6 or (1/3). \n3. For example, choose 1/4 and", "answer": " 476"}

How much is their rent?\n\n### Solution-2: We know that we are comparing the cost of living and we want to know how much the rent is in this circumstance. We're looking to divide the rent by $400 and find out how much is the rest, therefore the rent would equal $400/.070 or $56,667 per month.\n\n### Solution: To solve this one, you need to find out how much is $400 to the 30th power and round it to the nearest dollar. To do this, you can just write the number in scientific notation. To do this, just multiply $400 by 10-3 and then divide by 10-4, to get $1,200,000 or $1.2 million.\n\n### Notes:\nWhen trying to ask a question, you first decide on what type of question it is based on the way the question is phrased.\n\n### When answering a question, you start by reading the question and then looking at how everything is written. \n\n### When writing a question, you have to first decide on what type it is, and who it's directed towards, whether it's a grade school level and up to adults, or teens at the very least.\n\n### You have to consider what the question's asking, what it's trying to determine.\n\n### In answering a question, you have the option of first attempting to answer the", "answer": " 300"}

A company bought it to upgrade their network.  The price was more than the selling price.  The new price was more than the cost to upgrade.  The new price must be greater than the selling price because it is an improvement.\n\n## Response:  Yes, we would certainly expect that a computer that was used at the work was not connected to internet, would have at least price of $25 dollars.\n\n## Demonstration\n\n1. Given the first sentence, we can conclude that the computer at work was not connected and the computer had some sort of upgrade.\n2. If the company bought it to upgrade, it's only logical that this computer must have had a selling price to begin with (that would have been the price from which the upgrade is made). \n3. Also, the price of the upgrade cannot be greater than the seller price. This is because the purchase is done at a discounted rate, which would also mean that the company will be charged less for doing the upgrade.\n4.

One bill has to be affixed to 2 stamps if it contains a $1 stamp on the bill as a payment. For the job application or rebate, 1 stamp can cover all the mails since it already consists of just a single mail. We are only subtracting 1 rebate or job application from the total number.

Now, from here, we will assume that the same pattern holds true on Friday and Saturday. From Friday, we have 5, a third of 15. From Saturday, we have 16, a third of 24.\n3. Now, the key is to understand the question. The question says the number is the same as it is the Thursday as it is the Monday.\n4.

The question then asks us who put \"the man\", so it's clear that \"put\" is a verb that means \"to place\" or \"to position something in a certain way\".\n4. The next premise is about a \"man on the Moon\". This suggests that \"man\" refers to an individual and \"moon\" refers to a physical object.\n5. The last premise is \"Who put a human on the moon\".

First of all, let\u2019s make sure that we really understand the question being asked. What is the \u201cpaper\u201d that was \u201cturned in\u201d. Here we see that the grade is to be given for a paper; the student did not write the answer on a white board nor a blackboard. Thus it stands to reason that the paper the student submitted was not one that he wrote himself. This is one of the big giveaways that answers choice 2 D and choice 5 B are incorrect. The paper was written by another so it was not one that the student wrote. Also the question indicates that the student is asking what grade will he get NOT the actual grade he got on the paper.\n2. If student is asking he doesn\u2019t want to know the grade, he wants to know what grade he will get on the paper, and then the student does not have to know the number that he got on the paper in order to select a grade which gives more options to select.\n3.

So, looking at the five options, you are left with two letters.\nFirst we know that answer 4 C is definitely out for the two letters chosen. Why? Because if it is C the student got an F or a D or an A or a B. We know this because the letter D indicates a D or F below or DF; this indicates that the student who earned a DF will not get a C, therefore answer 4 C is out.\n4.

{"text": "15 minutes more than 30 minutes.\n\n### Rationale: The first step in this problem is to identify the variables at play. The washer's cycle takes 30 minutes to complete, and we can use that to calculate how long each pile takes, as follows:\n\n`($ \\text{Towels} + $ \\text{Sheets} - $ \\text{Gentle} \\times 2) - ( \\text{Gentleness})$\n1. \n2.\n3.\n\n$15 \\text{ minutes} - \\text{Gentlness}\\$\n\nWe can see in our equation that towels and sheets take up 90 minutes, but gentle wash only takes half as long. This means that we can subtract the wash time for gentle to equal the time to wash one pile. Subtracting from our equation gives us:\n\n$(15 \\text{minutes} - \\text{ Gentle}) - ( \\text{ Gentle} \\times 90 \\text{ minutes})$\n\nNext, we can calculate this with our given data that we know how long gentle is and subtract that from our equation.\n\n$$(15 \\text{ minute} - 60)$$\n\n60 minutes accounts for the time to wash twice as many towels at the same time as sheets. So we subtract and find that the washer needs 540 minutes to do these batches at once. Lastly, we must add the total minutes for these wash batches and see how long it needs. This gives us 565 total minutes.\n\n## Conclusion", "answer": " 135"}

Choices:  A) B) C) D) E)\nRationales: First thing that you need to do, is to eliminate the options that do not make sense with your scenario. When you choose the 4th option, you have to determine what kind of toys it means. \nThe first assumption you need to make is what kind of \"big kid's toys\" means to you. As you consider the options, you need to try and form a story in your mind with every answer choice you come across. \n\nIf you think about choice D like a little kid, they mean a toy that they are not able to play with or something their parents will bring them. \nIf you think about it like a teenager, these toys are not only for little kids, therefore they don't make sense for this person.\n\nLet's choose C as our best option, we will have to do some math to determine how many teens we need to have in order to fulfill this requirement of \"I want to play with the toys the teenager can play with.\"\nThe ratio of teens to kids is 3:5, which means we will need to add 2 teens in order to have 3/5 teens. \n\nOption E is clearly not correct, because this refers again to the situation of a little kid.\n\nNow for B option, it is clear that the author wants to play with the toy that a teenager can play, the only problem is the math. How many teenagers are there in this scenario. Well, the answer is 6, but since we don't know the names of those teens, we have no idea if those 6 teens include our main character. \n\nSo now we only have our options C and A, and from above paragraphs, we know that the correct answer is C.\nThe answer is: I have to be in the same age group to be able to play with someone's teenage toys.

{"text": "The weight of Karen's backpack is the same after six hours as before. Karen is hiking at a pace of 1 mile per hour and walking uphill for 25% of every hour she is hiking.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe question asks how much weight Karen is carrying each hour, so we know to find how much she is carrying weight (W) at any given point during her hike.\n\n#### We can eliminate the options we know to be incorrect. We know Karen packs 20, 10, and 20 and after six hours, she is drinking 2 and eating 1, which means she is losing 3 (21-18=3). We can eliminate the options that are less than 3.\n\n#### We know the hike takes 6 hours so that means she is consuming 4 pounds and her backpack must have 4, 1, and 2 in it respectively. This means she started the hike with 5, 2, and 3 in it.\n\n#### This means the weight of the gear, food, and water are changing during the hike (for a 3 lb increase in food weight for each lb lost in water weight), so we can eliminate options F and E.\n\n#### We do not know the time it takes her to hike each 1-mile section and we don't know how uphill she is walking (although these can be calculated and if they change her answer, it's a good opportunity to do so).\nOption B assumes an uphill climb (as it describes it's easier to go uphill than downhill) and this would change the weight of her backpack because she would gain weight because of the weight of her own body added to the weight of the backpack on her back, resulting in a higher uphill walking speed due to the increased weight.\n\nOption C is based on uphill walking being even for each mile hiked regardless of the direction of motion. If this were the case, it would mean that Karen needs to drink at the same speed as she eats, which is impossible.\n\n#### Option D contains some errors, such as the incorrect use of the variables, the units are not matching, and the logic does not work within the question's values.", "answer": " 34"}

First, let's work backwards. We know that the depth of the river by mid-August is the product of the mid-May depth and addition of the mid-June and mid-July depth.\n2). To find the mid-June depth, divide the product from before by 3.\n3). To find the mid July depth, add 10 to this new mid-June depth. \n4). The remaining is to solve to mid May depth. To do this, we need to find the number associated with the 3, which is the 1990 ocean floor depth to half the depth.\n5). For the 1991 depth to the ocean floor, the equation would be 1991 ocean floor depth = 1990 + (x-1990) in which x is the 1989 Ocean floor depth. \n6). Plug 1990 into the equation above to find the 1999 depth of the ocean floor.\n7). We use the original 1990 depth to solve for the mid May depth by removing the negative in the above equation to yield the following equation.\n8).

{"text": "He paid 700.\n\n    TotalCost = ((3 * 150) + 4 * 300) + ((3 * 100) * 25)\n\nInput: What are the last two cards? Choices:  \"54\" B: \"34\" C: \"92\" D: \"75\" E: \"123\"\nRationales:\n 1. The first step is to look at the context of the question itself. \"What are the last two cards?\" indicates that there is some set of cards, but the last two specifically. The question does not specify a size or number of cards, so it can be assumed that the two last cards are the only cards in the set.\n2. \"54\" can be eliminated fairly quickly, as 54 is not a correct sum and does not make sense in the context of the situation.\n3. Similarly, \"92\" can be eliminated. The sum of 92 is 143, still not a correct response.\n4. \"34\" can also be eliminated because the sum of 34 is 58, not 42.\n5. Now that the incorrect answers have been eliminated, we can analyze the other remaining answers. \"75\" would only be true if the number of cards were exactly 4, as 75 is the square root of 4. This cannot be the correct response because there may be other numbers with the square root of 3, so there is no way to ascertain that this is the sum of the last two cards without knowing the number of cards. \n6. Therefore, \"D: 123\" is the correct response, because the last two cards would be the same as the square of the last card.\n7. Note that 123 = 3 squared.\n8. We can think of a similar problem where we add two cards to get a square -- for example, if we had two cards 39 and 40, then the sum of 39+40 =179 which is 4 squared. (Note that you can arrive at a square by adding two cards, but in the beginning, they aren't the square of any number to begin with, so you'd actually have to calculate a square in this scenario).\n9", "answer": " 1825"}

Choices:  I: 99  II: 76 III: 59  IV: 11\nRationales: Let's work on answer choice I\n\n1. The key to understanding is that the number 99 is divisible by 5 and the rest of the options are divisible by 5. So 99 is the only one that may be divisible by 33 or 17.\n2. For 99 to be divisible by 17 the number after 9 is 9 and the number after 1 is 9 too. Since 9 has already been used the only possible number that can make 17 is 7 which is 76. So, 76 is the most likely option in 1 and 2 will be true.\n3. Similarly, answer choice 3's numbers need to be divisible by one number which is either 14 or 9. Therefore the numbers used will not be divisible by 9, they will be divisible by 5 which is 59, hence 59 is the option for 3. (Note that the number 76 was not an option for 3 or 4).\n4. Finally, answer choice 4 is the only option that will be divisible by either 14, 9 or 2. The first option that works is 2, but it's already used in 3 therefore the only feasible option is 11, which is the only option with 11 that fits, hence this is the answer to 4.\n\nHence the answer to the question is I : 99, III : 59 and IV: 11", "answer": " 26"}

{"text": "30\n\nInput: What is the temperature of an oil lamp? Choices: 1. hot 2. no heat 3. warm 4. normal 5. cool 6. frozen in the cold\nRationales: Option 1: hot: the lamp will get hot when it is on and the wick is burning.  Option 2: no heat: when the wick is out and not being used the oil lamp will return to a normal temperature. Option 3: Warm: this temperature is usually the time when the wick is in its normal position and the heat is getting to where it can be used warmly by others.  Option 4: Normal: this is when the heat is normal and warm for most people to use the lamp for the daily needs but not to a warm as the hot option.  Option 5: Cool: this means that the wick is out of its normal place and may need cleaned or need other action to put it back in the way and keep it on the lamp.

{"text": "Mr. Callen's total loss was :$517.00\n\n### Demostration:\n\nRationales:\n1. First, we will state each equation and then, solve for each one.\n2. For the sales price of paintings, we have: Sale Price * P - $40 per painting, where P is the price that Mr. Callen originally bought each painting for.\n3. For the sales price or wooden toys, we're going to have: Sales Price * T - $20 per wooden toy, where T is the price that Mr.Callen originally bought the wooden toy for.\n4. Using these equations, we can set them up like a mathematical equation as such: S1 = P - $40 and S2 = T - $20 and, substituting 1 for S1 and substituting 2 for S2.\n5. Now we can solve for S1 and S2 on the equation and it will give us: S1 + S2 = 1000 - 160 or S1 + S2= 840, and in this case that is 45%.\n6. For the final answer that equals Mr. Callen's actual price, we will take the total sales price of both items, multiply it by the sum, and subtract it by the total purchase price of both items.

{"text": "Jenny had $51 left of her original money.\n\nFirst of all, we need to determine how much Jenny started with, as we know her new total is $24. From the question, we can only speculate that Jenny started with an initial amount of money equivalent to the $24 dollars she started with but spent 3/7 of it, or 5/7 of it. \n\nNow, we can simplify the problem to the following, where A is Jenny's initial money and B is the amount left after the expenditure:\n\n$24 = $(1/7)*A + (1/7)*B\\implies24 = (1/7)*(A\u2013B)\\implies\n(5/7)*(A+B)=24$\n\nNow, the question asks for the amount of Jenny's initial amount, so we're asking for: $A/(A+B) \\implies A/A+B\\implies A/(A+1)\n\n$24 \\implies A = (1/1)*1 + 5/7 \\implies A = 5$\n\nTherefore, the answer is A: 5. \n\n### Answer:\nJenny had five dollars left of her original money\n\n### Instructions:Alice's mom has two daughters, her oldest and her youngest.

{"text": "7,000 baby tarantula legs\n\n### Justification:\nLet's break this down into its components:\n1. If a tarantula has 8 legs,\n2. and a tarantula egg sac typically contains 1000 baby taratula's,\n3. then\n\n$$\\text{ number of tarantula legs } = \\text{number of eggs } * \\text {number of baby tarantula's in each eggs } = 8 * 1000 = 8000$$\n\nand\n\n$$\\text { number of baby tarantula legs} = \\text { number of baby eggs } * \\text{number of legs in each eggs } = \\text{8000baby tarantula legs}$$\n\nFinally, to find the number of baby tarantulas legs in one egg sac less than 5 egg sacks, we can subtract the egg sacs:\n\n$x = (8000 - x) + 5$\n\n$x = 8001 - x,$ which means\n\n$8001 - 1 < x < 8001$\n\nTaking the range of $x, x = 7,001$ to $8000$ gives us the answer of 7,00.\n\n### Input : When you are in the bathroom, what are you not doing?

{"text": "Option E, 12 minutes. Note: this answer came from calculating minutes from hours and minutes.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The questions asks us how many miles the husband must ride at 20 miles an hour. Yolanda leaves home 5 miles from her work. She has 5 minutes to make it to work, 7 AM minus 5 minutes before 7 AM. If she travels at 20 miles a hour, she will reach work in 3 minutes. \n2. The next question asks for how many miles it took to reach her work. The answer is 2 miles. \n3. Therefore, the next answer asks us how long it will take, with her husband traveling at 2 speeds. Yolanda leaves 2 minutes before 7 AM, the husband must travel 2 miles at 20 mph, and the husband must travel 1 mile at 40 mph. We calculate this by adding the minute time when Yolanda leaves to the minutes it takes to reach her work. So when Yolanda leaves her house, there are 5 minutes before 10 AM to get there. If she's traveling at 20 m/h, it's 3 minutes, 2 miles traveled. Next 2 miles at 60mph is 12 minutes. So in total it took 15 minutes to travel 4 miles. Her husband must travel 5 miles at 40 m/h. \n4. Now you must multiply those values together. You must multiply by first, then multiply out 5 to get from minutes to hours. Then you must multiply 1/4 by the last value for the final minutes. \n5. So her husband will in 12 minutes be 1 mile ahead of Yolanda, total amount of time is 15 minutes plus 12 more minutes, 27 more minutes to travel the 5 miles. This is option E.\n### Note: \n* The speed of the bike is 40 m/ph, the speed of the car at 20 m, and the speed at 20mph is half the car's speed, so we double the time which would be 24 minutes.", "answer": " 15"}

{"text": "In this question, we are looking at a scenario where Susan is wanting to throw a party for Mom. We know that she is planning on having 28 people, which is 30 less 2. The question states that each pan of food makes 2 servings, and that each batch of one pan of food costs $5. We can eliminate the variable of $0.50 because that is equal to half of a cent, and is therefore is unreasonable. We can also eliminate $0.01 because that seems to be something very small that may not be worth spending resources on. We can cross this off the list because we know that Susan can buy 100 servings for $5. Looking back to the question we see that each pan makes exactly 2 servings, which means that each pan must be $5. We can also use logic to eliminate that we are talking about one pan because each pan costs $0.10, which would seem to indicate at least $0.20 per pan. Therefore there are 100 servins per pan, which are $0.50 each, which means that Susan will need to spend $50 to feed 30 people.\n\n### Input\nQuestion:Matt was a student in high school.

We need the answer to be 10 drinks D, 5 cakes C and 90 ice-creams I.  There is not enough money left because I is $50 and she only bought $80 worth of drinks. There are no more cakes to buy because C is $50 and D is $80. This leaves ice-creams. We know she bought 100 icecreams, but all the drinks she bought cost $20 and she only has $80. We know there are no cakes because we spent it all, so if we cannot buy any more cakes, we must buy more ice-creams. So we can buy 20 more ice-creams for $100, leaving us with $15 for her shopping budget.

Choices:  A - Bake more pieces B - Fill in the missing ingredients C - Flip to another recipe D - Add icing E - Blow it up\n\n### Dem:The first thing to do when attempting to solve this problem is to simplify it. It's pretty safe to assume that we are not considering any ingredients that are not already on the cake or that aren't in our possession. \n\n### Since that seems to be a given, the only thing that is causing this problem is the fact that the cake is too large, which is an indication that the cake is currently too big, or that the cake was originally larger. Additionally, when considering what the cake is too big compared to, this could be compared to the cake prior to someone eating it and that is no longer the case. \n\n## Dem: So the real question becomes \"How do we cut the cake so that it is the correct size\"? The next step is to isolate what is the same, while removing what is different. The main thing that is not different is our goal which is having a \"right sized\" cake. But we can exclude options 2,5, and 6 because the goal is to have a \"right sized\", not small sized 1, or huge sized 6.  \n\n## Dem: This removes the word \"small\" from 2, and the word \"huge\" from 6, leaving only the size \"right\" from 4 and 5. However we can disregard 4 because it was eaten. \n\n## Final Dem: So the only options left are: 1) Add ingredients to the base cake 2) Reduce the ingredients 3) Reduce the number of pieces\n\n## Final Dem - Final Dem: The goal in this case is to have the right size cake.

{"text": "Michael: 50 cards\nLloyd: 19 cards\nMark: 20 cards\n#### Rationale:\n1. Mark has 10 fewer than Michael and twice as many as Lloyd.\n2. Mark has 125 cards, meaning he has 2 more than Michael.\n3. Lloyd could not be the correct answer because he only has half as many cards as Mark - he doesn't have 100 cards.\n4. Michael has 110 cards and doubled it by now collecting 50 cards. Thus, he has 160 cards.\n5. Since Michael has 2 times as many as Lloyd and 2 times as many again as Mark, his total would be 4 times as much as Mark's.\n6. There's only one person left to find and this is Michael, the person that had the least amount of cards.\n7. As a result, the only person who can end with 300 cards is Michael.\n8.

If Jason goes 6 times in 4 weeks, what is William\u2019s number of times of library goings?\n\nAnswer: 2 times.\n\n### Solution:\n1. Subtracting `6-4` from 6, we get `2`. So, Jason goes to the library `2` more times than William.\n2. Subtracting 2 from 24 (we know how many times William goes to library per week), we get `22`. So, Jason go to library `2` times more than William in `4` weeks.\n3. Jason goes to library `22` times and William goes `40-22` times (22-5=17).

Choice D is irrelevant since it's impossible. If the water never reaches boiling temperatures, then the pasta will always have an irregular shape. So this choice cannot be correct.\n4..Choice E is not the answer to the question.

{"text": "Answer: 28 cups of flour\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Given the provided information, we can assume that the measurements of a cup will be consistent and therefore Hannah needs to have a total of 80 cups of flour.\n2. To make 20 banana mushes, we need 80 bananas. But we have only 20 bananas (this is the question we are looking to answer.)\n3. So that leaves us with dividing 80 by 20 to get the answer of 4. This means that to make 20 bananas mashes we need 80/4=20 bananas. This means there's enough flour for 80 cups.\n4. To get the number of cups of flour, the answer is 80/1 = 80.\n5.

{"text": "She has only half the amount of money in reserve, so double that and you get the extra she need, $100*1/2 dollars, which is $50.\n\n### Input and Question:Lisa said she was going to give a concert performance. She said that it might go on longer than what is normal for these concerts, and that it wouldn't be a simple or boring one-piece concert. \n\n### Demand:What concert performance does the sentence concern?\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. First, we have to identify the concert performance that Lisa is referring to.\n2. One concert performance for the sentence refers to a music performance by one person, usually in a small venue or event. In contrast, a concert generally denotes a multi-performer event.\n3. In the context of the question and response the option \"A. a one-off concert B. a live concert\" is the correct answer because, if Lisa had said it might not be a \"one-off\" or \"one piece\" performance, she was referring to a concert. \n4. Therefore, \"a one-off concert\" and \"a live concert\" are the two options that are in the context of the sentence, which would make answer choice \"a one-off-concert\" the correct answer.\n5. In short, the proper answer to this question is: A. a one-off-conert\n\n### Demands:You can see that it was not a simple or boring on-off-concert.\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Simple and boring would only refer to a one-off- concert, so we can eliminate the incorrect answer choices that suggest a \"live concert\", which would be too generic.\n2. The second answer is correct because it's a way to explain exactly why the concert wasn't simple or boring at the time it was given. \n3. Therefore, the correct choice \"It was not a simple or a boring on-off concert.\" will apply to the context of the original sentence.\n4. \"A. It was not a simple or simple concert B. It was not a boring or boring concert\" are both incorrect because simple and boring don't really apply to a whole concert except a one-off- performance.\n5.

What is the maximum speed of an airplane when the car can travel at its maximum speed at a speed of 1 hr per 32 mph?\n\n### Rationales: 1 - A car's maximum speed is 60 mph.\n2 - The airplane's speed depends on one thing which is the distance it travels. So the plane flies 30 hrs to cover a distance of 120 hours.\n3 - Therefore, 32mph = 3600 min/h = 48h hours.\n4 - Since the plane travels at 30 hrs and is faster than the car at a speed of 48 hrs. The plane will cover a distance of 2760.\n5 - If car travels with a speed of 120mph and the car will be travelling 2760hrs. That's 120 X 27 hrs. 120 X (27 days) X (27 days).\n6 - If the car travels at a speed of 5 seconds then 120m x (27 days) = 3096 hrs.

Choices: \tA: community C: school B: government D: church E: home\nRationales:1. Considering what is in the question, we know that \"Marth\" is a person helping children. That means this person is not helping children by themselves, but through an organization.\n2. A: community - As a nonprofit, the community is the main area where \"Marth\" is helping children\n\n3. Choice A: community - It is the most plausible answer. First, a community is a place where several people gather. And what is a specific purpose of a nonprofit?\n\n4. Secondly, \"Marth\" is working for a non-profit. It means that she works and helps people and children.\n\n5. Therefore, we can eliminate Choice B: school.\n\n6. As a non-profit, \"Marth\" helps children, not teenagers.\n\n7. Also, school helps children learn and grow, but the main goal is not to help children.\n\n8. Therefore, we have to eliminate Choice C: church.\n\n9. A church doesn't work with the main purpose of working for people and kids. Their main purposes are helping God, worshiping God, and learning about faith.\n\n10. Also, a church teaches teenagers how to have positive relationships and helps with family affairs.\n\n11.

{"text": "There are two methods for arriving at this answer.\n\n**Demonstration**:\nStart with the problem:\n\n| Starting Week | Total Juggled | Increment Per Week |\n---|---|---|\n| 1 | 3 | 2 |\n| 2 | 5 | 3 |\n| 3 | 7 | 4 |\n| 4 | 9 | 5 |\n\nAbove, the number of objects juggled increases linearly with every week. The increment per week, is the number of objects the juggler could do each following week.\n\nIn this case, this increment is equal to 2, because each week the juggler could be able to juggle 2 more than the previous week. Note the total number of weeks is equal to 5 and the increment per week is equal to \"2\" in this case.\n\nAs a result, each week, the total number of juggled objects increases by 2.\nFor instance, at the beginning, 3 is equivalent to 5 because the increments are each week. In other words, \"2 + 2 = 5.\"\n\nThe total in the last week would be 15, because of 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 and then two more.\n\nIn other words, each week, the final number of objects juggles is doubled from the previous week.\nFor example, when starting at 3 objects, the first week is 5, the second week is 7, and so on. Therefore, if Jeanette is able to juggle 3 objects after 3 weeks of practice, then she could probably juggle 7 objects in 5 weeks of practice.\n\nNext, let us determine the total amount of objects that Jeanette can juggle over 5 weeks.\n\n| First Week | Second Week | Third Week | Fourth Week | Fifth Week |\n---| ---| ---| ---|---|\n| Original Juggled Objects | +2 | +4 | +6 | +8 |\n\nAdd it all up, and you'll get 17 objects total in total over 5 weeks of juggling.\n\nThis demonstrates that Jeanette can juggled 17 objects by the end of her 5 weeks.\nNote: this method is for only the", "answer": " 13"}

{"text": "$25\n\n### Justification:Glenn is first shown to have gone to the movie theater twice, once on Wednesday, and once on Saturday.\n\nThe first thing to note is that Glenn didn't go to the movie theater every day. He only went once a week, and the question does not say whether he went to the movie theater the first time on Wednesday or the first time on Saturday.\n\nTherefore, we need to ask:\n\nSuppose that he went on Saturday. How much does he spend? The first three prices are as follows:\n\n$5 on Monday, $10 on Wednesday, $20 on Saturday.\n\nWhat do these prices mean?\n\nThe movie costs $5 every Monday, $10 every Wednesday, and $20 every Saturday. This means that the prices triple on Monday, double on Wednesday, but only double on Saturday.\n\nThis means that if the first time Glenn went to the movie theaters was on Saturday, then he would spend $5 + $10 + $20, or a total of $35.\n\n### However, suppose the first time he went to the movie was on Wednesday. How much would he spend?\n\nThe first three prices are as following:\n\n$5 is the cost on Monday, $15 is the cost on Wednesday, which is twice as much as on Monday, and $30 is the cost on Saturday, which is 4 times as the cost on Monday, the first day he went.\n\nThis means his first time at the movie theater on Monday = $5.\n\nHis second time at the movie theaters on Wednesday = $15.\n\nHIs third time at the movie theatres on Saturday = $30.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\nFrom the first time he went, Glenn's movie ticket prices are tripled for every two days he goes, and this happens each time he goes to the movie theaters until the day where movie tickets cost five times more than on the day he first went, which is Saturday.\n\nThere are thus three possible cases Glenn could go to the movie theaters: The first two days were Monday and Wednesday. The next two days were Wednesday and Saturday. The last two were Saturday", "answer": " 35"}

Choices: A: 39 times B: 48 times C: 58 times D: 61 times E: 40 times\n\n### Response;\nThe best possible answer is A: 39 x because there can never be equal to or more than total times than the original number of objects.\n\n### Rational;\nIf marbles fall 100 times, then the number of times that each one falls only can be 0.4 x times. Since 0.4 x can\u2019t be more than 100 times and can never be less than 0, we can only get 39 x which is equal or less than 100.\nSo, A: 39 is the best possible answer.\n\n### Solution2;\nThe answer to the following question is Option B: 48 x, we can get this answer if 40 marbles in 40 trials. If the total number of trials is 105 and the total number of marbles is 100 so, the total number of marble falls = 105. if 40 marble falls 100 times which is equal of 105 so 40 marbles falls 100 x.

Thousands of years ago, the young man Ramses II was in the final stages of his reign. He was feeling confident in his achievements, so he built himself a luxurious tomb in which to die. It would be built to last, with special precautions for the pharaoh's burial by placing his body in an airless chamber and filling the whole inner chamber in the tomb with stone blocks so that nothing would be able to pierce the chamber's walls and disturb his body's last resting place. Too bad that he forgot something- a certain 3000-year-old tomb that he built for one of his servants back in the day was built with a rather large crack. It was a huge oversight that his great grandson Pharaoh Ramesses IV himself repented, and he decided to redo the tomb with a more reliable design. However, when he realized that the tomb could be breached, he did something unforeseen, and he put the young pharaoh\u2019s body in the tomb he built for his servant a thousand years earlier, hoping that he would be protected even if the tomb were breached. Unfortunately, the body never received this honor, because within the next 500 years, tomb robbers did in fact break through and rob the servant's tomb, even finding and looting the mummy!\n\n\nThis is not an input, but an illustration of the prompt.

How much more time will it take for him to purchase the book?\n\n### Rationales:\n\n### Correct Response:45 minutes\n\nThis problem asks us to solve for the unknown amount _x_ and then make use of it. The question doesn't specify that the answer is a number of minutes, so we must figure that out on our own. If the question was asking to select the quantity without solving for _x_, we could select \"hours.\"\n\n### Solution:\n\nLet _x_ represent the number of minutes it takes the teacher to get the book.\nIn order to figure out how long it will take the teacher to reach the desired dollar amount, we must write the equation with the unknown and the desired outcome. Our equation will be:\n```\n$1 = _x_\n```\nWe know that:\n- 1 is the unknown\n- $1 is the desired outcome\n- _x_ represents the number of minutes\n\nThe teacher needs to get a book that is $1 more than his budget, which is stated as \"the price is a dollar _more_ than he has.\" Therefore, we know if the teacher has $1, it is 1 dollar _less_ than he needs. We can use that information to manipulate our initial equation.\n```\n$1 > 1\n```\nSince we know that our problem requires our output to be $1 greater than the input, _x_ is actually going to be negative. Negatives are counted as negatives when multiplied or divided.\n```\n_x_ > 0\n```\nNow we can manipulate our equation to solve.\n```\n_1_ > -_x_\n```\nMultiply both sides of the equation by -1\n```\n-_1_ < -1.00* _x_\n```", "answer": " 52"}

So we can solve this as a simple multiplication problem. \nLet _______ be Jills basket capacity, _______ be Jacks basket capacity, _____ be Jill's basket, and _______ be Jack's basket.\n\nJill' basket - 8\nJack' basket - ______\nJill' basket x ______\nJack' basket x _____\n______ x ______ = ______\n\nJills basket x ______ = 8\nJack's basket x _____ = 8\n\n8 x ______ = __ 16\n\n8 x Jack's basket capacity - 8\n\nJack's basket capacity = ______\n_____ = 8 x Jack's Basket Capacity\n\nTherefore Jack's basket capacity : _____ = ______ apples which is 8 times as much.\n\n#### Rationales:\nThe solution uses the knowledge of the problem and the values provided in the question. First, we must find the capacity of Jills basket. The question tells us it can \"hold\" twice as much as Jacks basket. That means that both baskets have a capacity of 4 apples, when they are each full.\n\nThe next step is to find the capacity of Jacks basket. Using the knowledge that Jills basket capacity is 4, and using the given values from the question, we can find Jacks basket by multiplying _Jills Basket Capacity_ x _Jills BasketCapacity_\n\n4 x 4 = 16\n\n16 is what Jacks basket capacity is, so 8 is what his basket can hold when full.\n\nFrom there we know Jills basket capacity = ____8 ______\n\n___8 _____ = 8 times as much as Jack' basket. \n\nWhen Jills basket was full with 8 apples, Jacks basket was full with 12 because Jill currently can fit twice", "answer": " 3"}

This is all written correctly but we have a logical problem with this math problem. We have no idea how many marbles Katrina has. If we assume that Katrina just has the amount Amanda does, is this math problem saying that Mabel, Amanda, Katrina each have the same amount of marbles or does someone have more marbles than Katrina. The assumption with this is that everyone has the same of a certain amount of marbles, when in reality they do not. This information is crucial to solving this math problem. If Mabel has exactly 13 times as many marbles than Katrin, Katrina having some kind of odd amount, then Mabel would need 81 marbles to have the same of Amanda and Katrina. If Katrina has 12 or more marbles than Amanda, then Mabel would still need to need 85, not 81. We must also have an idea of Amanda's marbles, or we could be thinking Mabel needs to get exactly 85 even if Mabel has twice as many with Katrina, Amanda would still need 12 more. We as humans cannot say that someone is 5 or 12 times as something without actually knowing the value of something, this could mean that you have half or almost as much.\n\n#### Input:Amanda needs an extra 12 marbles if she wants to double her amount of marbles. \nWhat is the smallest whole number of marbles that Amanda has?\n\n#### Rationale (Answer): The smallest amount of total marbles would be 12.\n\n#### Logic:  Amanda needs 16 marbles\n\nTherefore, she would need 12 more marble to have twice as many as Katrina.\n\n#### Demostration: \n\nWe know that Mabel has at least 5 more marbles than Katherine, and we know that Amanda needs to have 12 extra marbles in total.", "answer": " 63"}

{"text": "There were a total of 10 girls including the 8 that were already on the minibus, so 2 girls weren't able to go on the trip.\n\n### Explanation:\n1. The question asks \"how many girls were not able on join the trip?\" and provides that the girls that were already on the bus were 8 (they call this a starting value).\n2. We eliminate answer choice 1 because 18 is a starting value, which would make it incorrect.\n3. Answer choice 2 is incorrect because one of the students in the minibus is assumed to be a girl, and since there are 8 (a starting value) girls in the minibus, we already have one plus the rest of the girls.\n4. Now, we use the distributive property, but since we know the starting value we already multiplied the quantity in the middle to the starting value. \n  \n```math\n(n * (m - n)) - n = (n * 18) - 18\n```\n  \n5. Therefore, we are now left with 18 - 18 = 0, which is not a valid answer, and the only option that leaves is 3. The question is \"how many were not able to join\", since the other 8 could join, 3 girls were supposed to be on the minibus, but since there were only 8, 3 girls couldn't make it to the trip.\n6.

How many problems does a person need to avoid in order to not fail?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: A new employee has to pass a test to work there, there are 24 questions in a test, to pass he or she must answe 8 of the 24 questions. To fail, he must fail 16 questions. To not pass he must fail fewer then 16 questions, he must then answer 2 or more questions. To answer the question of what number he must not fail, we would need to find what number would be more then enough to not fail. We know that to pass the person must answer 24 questions, and to not fail he must answer less then 16 questions. What number would be higher than 16 and smaller than 24, so that the test taker would not fail. The question states the questions are unique, so we can't take any out of the equation. We know he may not answer the same question or answer less 24, to answer less then 10 he would need to not answer 14.\n\nThe question asks for the lowest number, meaning there can be no negative answers (since questions are unique).\n\nThe question asks us to answer as few as possible, meaning it cannot be negative.\n\nTherefore the answer is 15, a person with this level of incorrect questions will not fail.\n\n###", "answer": " 220"}

The plumbing you're looking for would not be in option A - the oil refinery. \n2. Looking at the remaining options in relation to a desert (a dry environment) eliminates 3 of the options. Option B: \"desert home\" doesn't provide much water either and, without water, there's probably not a plumbing system there - so that eliminates. \nOption C: \"ocean\" has water, but there's no way you'd find desert plumbing there.

{"text": "In five minutes, Missy can serve 12 standard care patients. Therefore, to serve each special care patient takes five additional minutes. (20% of 12 is 2.4, so the answer is 17 minutes).\n\n### Rationale:First, let's determine how long it takes to serve each standard care patients, as these are the biggest quantity. Each patient is standard care, so we need to find the number to use in the 12.  The number of serving times takes 5 minutes.  (5)(12) = 60.    If there are 12 standard care needs, then 12 times 5 gives us 60.\n\nNext, let's determine the amount of time that the special care patients will take to be served.  We need to find the amount of time to serve these patients.  (12(12/12)) = 12, which is the amount of time that it takes to serve each patient.  With a number of 12, we know that the total is 12 times itself, which is 144.    So, multiplying 2 by 144 gives us 288 minutes of a special need patient.  Now that we have this, let's calculate the time needed to serve all patients for each situation.  We need that total number, and we know for 12 standard needs it can be done in 5 minutes, (5)(12).  If all of that is true, then dividing 5 by 12, we get 0.4166666, or just over 4 minutes.    The time added on top of that would be for special needs, and we know that it takes 288 minutes.  This means that 288 is 10.8 times higher than when we are serving standard needs.    If 12 times 1 is equal to 144, then we multiply (10.8)(144) to get 1535.6 times special needs patients.  This leaves us with 1535, so 1535 + 324.\n\nFrom this, we see that it takes a total of 1535 minutes to serve 12 standard patients + 324 special patients, which", "answer": " 64"}

Therefore, they spent 30 minutes before the movies began. \n2. The first movie is about 1 hour and 20 minutes long, so it took two and a half hours to watch it. \n3. The second movie is 20 minutes before the first movie began so the friends got a head start on time spent, as it's 30 minutes long, so that means the second movie took 50 minutes to watch. In total, it took one hour or 100 minutes to watch two movies, so then 200 minutes for 2 movies x 1.5 = 300 minutes total, which is equal to 5 hours total. 6.5 hours, not 6\n\n### Demolished Response:\nInput: A: B: C: D: E:\nRationales: For A, the answer is not 20, because 'twice as long as' is being used as a comparison to the time spent to make fries, and in the question, 10 minutes was spent to make popcorn, so the two have to be equal so the math wouldn't come up with the wrong answer, so that means A can't be the right answer. For B, 30 is the correct one because the second movie's length, plus the amount of time spent to make french fries is 30, and if you add that to the 1.5, you get 1.5+30=31.5, which can't be converted to an hour, so 1.5 does not equal 1.5+25, so 20 will be the correct answer.

This is because by Friday the least rain (2 inches) was reached.\n\n### Counterarguments:\nOne counter argument would be to use the assumption that an inch of rain does not represent the same volume as one inch, and by doing an actual calculation that an inch of rainfall would add up to a greater number of inches of rainfall. The calculation would be as followed: if 2 inches of rain is enough to fill a water bottle that is approximately 5 inches tall, then every added inch of rain could fill the bottle a tenth of the original value, adding up to a large number, where as an inch and three ounces (another way to think of inches of rain in terms of measurement) we could calculate that an inch of water would take up 27.413 oun", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "$180 ($9 per slice and 20 whole slices of custard pie)\n\n### Explanation: 1. The first set of questions is designed to lead up to the core question. We know each slice is $3, and a whole pie costs $30, which is $100 of profit to the shop. A pie is then cut into 10 sized pieces, and this leads us to the core question. The shop will take a $100 profit, and then divide it by 10, which means they will take 10% of the original pie.\n\n### 2. We know that each slice is $3 and the shop will take a 10% cut of each whole $30 pie. This leads to the second part of the core question. Because the shop takes 10% of $30, they will make profit on each additional slice. Each 10% cut means that you will make $3 more for each additional slice sold, so the shop would make $3 for each slice.\n\n### Input:$6,890 $9 $556,603$2 $5,030,447 \n\n### Response:$5,566,160$556,603/2$2\n\n### Expanation:\n\nThe first set of problems asks you to find the total amount of money in the bank account.

{"text": "Answer in dollars.\n\n### Explanation:\nInput: The IRS will arrest Jack, the scammer, if he receives multiple $500 gift cards from Jack, for a total of over $1200. If Jack returns only one $200 Wal-Mart gift card for a total of $200 and another $500 gift card from Jack, then Jack will still have multiple gift cards with a total value of over $1700, which includes over $1000 worth of gift cards from Best Buy.\n\n\n### Input - Rationale:\n1. Firstly, we must address the scammer who warns Jack of the IRS's intent to arrest Jack if he doesn`t send the codes from 6 x $500 Best Best gift cards and 9 x $200 Wal mart gift cards.\n2. Secondly, We are given the information that Jack wises up and decides to hang up.\n3. Thus, the final value of the gift cards that Jack doesn`t give to the scammer is 3 x $500 + 2 x $200 = $1300.\n\n### Input; Rationale:\n1) Firstly, the task states that Jack calls scam artist. Jack doesn`t really mean it and is trying to test him.\n\n2) Secondly, we have an instruction stating that Jack sends a few codes to the scam artist.\n\n3) Finally, the task mentions that they want to get a total amount of $1200 so they start stealing cards. They need 15 of the $500 gift-cards and 18 of the $200 gift-cards.\n\n### Solution:\n4) In this task, we've been provided with all the information we might need in order to calculate the desired amount.\n\nIn this task, we have 6 x $550 + (9 x $20) as the total value of gift cards that they can steal.\n\n5) If we divide 6 x $580 + 20 x $240 by 18, we get the result of $580/18 + ($240+20)/18 which equals $580/9 + $30/", "answer": " 3900"}

{"text": "He needs to save another $22.\n\n### Explanation: Using only the information provided, we know that he wants to save up for the video game that costs $60. If his earning for the previous weekend was $35, then the amount he had saved previously was $22. Furthermore, the question states he \"caught five fish this Sunday.\" This does not include how many fish were blue-gill and how many were trout. After taking into account the information from the question, we can determine that we only need to multiply the number of blue-gill by 4 and trout by 6 in order to get the right answer. Let's denote the number of blue-bill and trout as X and Y, respectively: $$ X\\times 4\\text{ and } Y*6 = (80\\text{ X }0.6=48), (12,000 \\text{X} 0.6 = 7200)$$ After setting all values to one constant, our formula becomes X * Y = ____. Multiplying X and Y gives us 10,000 = 80, so X = 1 and Y = 90.\n\n### Input:\"Betty and Joe each earned 2/5 as much money as Ann last year.\n\n### Response:\"Last year, each of them earned $80.\"\n\n### Explanaition: From the question, we can clearly conclude that, each of Betty, Joe and Ann, works as a plumber and they are equally paid. Now, if a given year, each of them earns 2/5 as amount as Ann then it means that, the Ann's annual income was 5x/20 or 2.5x of other's and hence Betty earned 5x/25 or 200 dollars and Joe earned 5x/50 or 100 dollars.\n\n###Input: A baker had a large supply of white flour but none at all of white sugar.\nIf the baker had a large quantity of white flour (quantity X), how much white sugar did the baker have?

The width of a cat is equal to 4.8 times the width of a parrot. If the height of the cage is 2 times wider than the length of the cage. How wide can you make the cage so it can contain a parrot, a parrot and a cat?\n\n### Demos:\n1) First we have to convert the measurements in centimeters and meters to inches\n2) Parrot width=210 cm -2*cm=208cm=8.42 inches\n2) Cat width = 48cm-2*cm=46cm=1.81 inches\n3) In order to have a 2*length cage we have to multiply the length by 2 in order to multiply the length by two cm you have to multiply by 0.125cm and cm by meters=25.4 and 2 meters will equal to 50.9 centimeters.\n4) The answer will equal to the width 212cm which =8.39 inches, 4.8-0.125=4.675=1.8.\n5) Since the cat is 1.81 it will just fill up the left over because the width is 8.39 inches.\n6) Then since the width is 25.4 inches and the height is 25.5 =4.19\n7) Then since the height is 4.19 centimeters and the width is 208 cm =8.59 inches.\nanswer=", "answer": " 54"}
{"text": "The total number of miles the friends run together is 40 miles because Sam ran a total of 14 miles while Harvey ran a total of 26 miles. \n\n### Explanation: I solved this using the following steps:\n1. The problem says that the two friends run a footrace, which is a short race between people usually meant to be entertainment.\n2. The problem also says that this footrace is to see who is better at running. This helps us know that the purpose of the footrace is to determine better at running, not to run the fastest.\n3. From looking at the choices, we can eliminate any answers that do not have a total of 40 miles, including answer choice C - \"24.\"  We can infer that the answer must be greater than 24 since the choice is listed under the answer choice that is 24.\n4. Next we look at answer choices that have a total that exceeds 24. We can see that answer choice A - \"26 miles\" - is the first of these, and is the correct answer. Therefore, in the long run, Harvey ran 8 miles more than Sam, which totals up to 26 miles.\n5. Finally, we take the total of the both of their runs, and we can see that after the race, the two friends added up to a total of 48 miles. Because we already know that the answer is 26 miles and the two friends' total is 48 miles, that leaves the remaining 22 miles attributed to Sam.\n6. The final answer is A: 26 miles.", "answer": " 32"}

The sun rises in the east and sets in the west.\n> D.

As you could see in the picture below, it would still have the ability even if it is rising and setting in the opposite direction of the window.\n> Choice D is incorrect because light comes through the windows because sunlight is shining below the horizon, below the window.\n\n### Answer:\n> E. As the diagram shows, in the direction of sunlight, the sun rises in the East. It then travels to the West as the days pass. As it travels towards the west, the entire sky gets darker. It then travels below the horizon, where it sets at night. In classrooms, windows face the opposite direction of the sun, so sunlight would only travel directly to the classroom if the sun was directly above the classroom, at the exact mid point of its path across the sky.\n> Classrooms in this school often face the South-West, where the sun is positioned directly above the classroom in the morning, then traveling below the horizon at night.\n### Instruptions:\nAnswer the following question regarding the following text.\n\n### Question:\n### What does the author describe as the \"perfect balance\" of a student in regard to their academic performance and extra-curricular commitments?", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "Jack and Jill split the bill of a cottage rental. They each paid 25 dollars when renting for eight hours.\n\n### Rationales:\n  * The two friends rent the cottage for eight hours. Each of them paid 25 dollars.\n\n### Explanation:\n  * Jack and Jill shared the rent of $5 an hour. Their time rental must be multiplied by the $5. If each of their time cost each another 25 dollars when combined, Jack and Jill paid 325 dollars. If the cottage cost $5 an hour, the sum can be broken down to how much each friend paid when one of them rented the cottage. When two friends rented it, a half of the cost must be added, 63. 63 dollars is equal to 126 dollars and 12 cents.\n  * Since the calculation showed that each of the friends paid 25 dollars, the answer is correct.\n\nAnswer: 25 dollars\n\n### Input. John ran his race faster than Jim. If they ran the same distance, the difference was three minutes. How fast does John run the mile?\n\n### Rationale:\n\nJohn ran the mile in seven minutes.

{"text": "45\n\nInput:  What isn't an example of a vegetable? Choices:  B: fruit C: cheese D: meat E: milk\nRationales:\n1. First, determine key points that the question is asking. What isn't a vegetable is the answer choice, which indicates that there are some qualities that separate a vegetable from a non-vegetable.\n2. To eliminate options based on logic and common sense, begin with answer option F \"fruit\". While fruits are technically considered vegetables, when used as culinary terms, \"fruit\" tends to have more of a \"sweet\" meaning. For example, a fruit smoothie is a sweet, fruit-based drink, but a vegetable smoothie is often an un-sweet, vege-based drink. In the same way, while carrots, broccoli, and potatoes might be called \"vegetables\" by culinary standards, they would typically not be labeled \"fruit\", so option F: \"fruit\" can be eliminated.\n3. Next, option B: \"milk\" is almost correct. Milk can be called a vegetable, as a mother's milk can be considered to be derived from vegetables. However, milk on its own is far more likely to refer to dairy products or cow based creams, and so, option B: \"fruit\" is also eliminated.\n4. However, answer option D: \"meat\" could be confused with this, because of its similarity to \"milk\". While meat is indeed a \"vegetable\", it is not a type of vegetable that we tend to consume in its raw state, rather, meat is derived from animals, rather than vegetables. It's not clear if the question is expecting the answer to be \"meat\", or if it simply wants the answer to be a vegetable that isn't meat, thus option D: \"meet\" cannot be the correct answer.\n5. Therefore, the correct response is option C: \"cheese\". Cheese is indeed vegetable \"based\" in that it is derived from vegetable-based products and foods, such as milk and cream. However, it's highly unlikely to be found in raw form, which is more typical of meat, which is why option \"D\" is not a fit.\n\n**", "answer": " 210"}

Choice D is a violation of the chronological order, because the years start in spring and end the calendar year in fall. This is not a legitimate answer.

From the question, it is given that:\n* x + y = 60 (height)\n* xy = 26 (area of the card)\n\n\nFrom the information given, one can derive that the height of the card should be less than the width of the card.\nAs a result, we get 'y=14', but 'x = 40', so the width of the card is more than height as the given.\n\n\nSo, the area of the card is '26'.\n\n\nWe can do the same process for the house of 2 persons.\n\n\nFor the first card:\n\nThe width of the card will be 40: 2 * 40 = 80\n\nThe area of the card: 26\n\n\nAnd the height of the card: 14\n\n\nNow, we will start the second card.\n\nThe width of second is: 40 x 2 (since 2 people are building the card).\n\nThe height of the second card: 15\n\n\nNow, for the third card.\n\nThe height of third card is 16 because the total height of 3 cards are combined to a total of: 16\n\n\nNow, if you put this cards side by side vertically, it forms a triangle with total height as 16 + 14 + 15 = 45 \n\n\nThe base of the triangle will be 360 \n\n\nAfter finding the base of the triangle, we", "answer": " 1200"}

Choices: B: water D: drinking cup C: sink C: pet E: bathroom floor\n\nRationales:\n\n1. There is no logical sense that there is no water at all lost to evaporation if the faucet isn't actually turned on. Perhaps that's not lost to evaporation at all.\n2. Answer choice A: \"water\" is not lost at all. If evaporated no water is lost. And furthermore, there's no mention of a cup in the prompt, so you can't lose it either.\n3. Answer choice C: \"sink\" is likely to be the cause of water loss.\n4. Answer choices D: \"drinking cup\" and E: \"pet\" are not the causes of water loss in the prompt.\n5. Therefore, \"sink\" should be marked as a likely cause of water loss here, especially if the user of the sink is not present to turn off the faucet.\n\n### Response\nIf someone leaves a faucet on and nobody is around to turn it off or shut it, it will cause it to evaporate. This water would evaporate into the air if it were not caught by a sink. Likely, if you turned on a faucet, it would flood your sink with water. And evaporative loss from your sink to the air is usually prevented by the presence of a sink.\n\n### Write a response that appropriates the instruction below:\n\nInput: Where can I find a good dentist in my area.

{"text": "They received 10 turtles together.\n\n### Justification:\n1. There are a total of 50 turtles collected, so Marion received 30 and Martha 20. \n2. With 20 more tally marks in total, this means Marion received 10 more turtles.  \n3. We do not know how many turtles Marion received, but with 10 turtle more than Martha, Marion received a total of (10+20) turtles.\n4. Therefore, Martha received (20+20), so a total of 40 turtle.\n5. Therefore, Marion received 32 turtles, and Martha also received 32, but since she received 20 more Martha's total is 10 more.\n6. With 10 turtled from Martha and Marion's total being Marion's, therefore Marion received 12 more than Martha (with 40 more from Martha), therefore Marion received 20 turtles, meaning Martha has 20 more.\n7. For Marion: 10 + 12 = 20 more so total is 20 more. \n8. For Martha: 10+20=20 more so total = 20. 12 is not in the formula so that is incorrect \n9. Therefore (since 12+20 are both Martha) = 32 so Marion received 22, Martha received 22, to get to (20+220) you would have to add all 22 together (22+82+86+100+0) which is 220, meaning that together they both received 12 which is a total of 42 turtles.\n\n### Discussion:\nAs we can see in the previous justification, the 12 is not actually found anywhere in the solution and can be misleading to not add for the missing pieces that are found in the formula.\n\n### Input1:\n\n<button type=\"button\" onclick=\"submit(document.getElementById('form1').getElementById('question1').value, document.getElementById('form", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "$12.00\n\n### Instructor:Betty, Weng does not work more than 50 minutes. So, she makes exactly $12.0\n\n### Response Rationales\n\n1. Betty is answering the question as follows: Weng's rate for babysitting is $12 an hour. If she works more than one hour, she makes more than $12; if she works less, she makes less than $12.\n2. The premise of the question is that Weng worked less than one hour, so Betty is saying that Weng would not expect to make more than $12. This explanation is incorrect.\n3. The explanation does not match up to the question. The question clearly states that Weng did less than an hour of babysitting, not that she worked more than one hour.\n4. In the context of the question and the numbers involved, Weng earned exactly $12. She either spent over 50 minutes or under 50 minutes babysitting. If she babysat for over 50 minutes, she would have earned more than $12 and if she babysat under 50 minutes, Weng would have earned under $12.\n5. As such, the correct answer is $12.\nAnswer: $12\n\n### Instructions:Find the sum of 2,13,27,42,68,99 and 127.\n\n### Response\n\n2,13, 27, 42, 68, 99, 127\n\n### Response rationales\n\n1.

The only answer is 641, and the reason why is because the answer is the total number of all the numbers above the line.\n4.

In this case 5 pieces of hammers is $15 (5 * $3), 4 sets of French Fries is $5.60 (4 * $1.20), 5 cups of Soda is $2.5 (5 * $0.5), and 1 platter o spaghetti is $2.75 (1 * $2.7)\n5. Now, divide the total price that you come up with by the number of people in the group to find how much each person will owe. \n6.

So, $120 - $40 = $80.\nSo, Stella is out $40 total.\n\nBeth brought $20, which means she gave the other two guys $20 each, $20 +20 = $$40.\n\nNow John:\nJohn is out $40 and Beth is out $40, which means he is out the same amount she is, so $20.\nBringing it all home: \n80 - 20 = $60\n\nSo if Stella brought $120, she is out $60 which means she took $60 of her own money.\nHence, when it's all said and done, the total spent is $60.\n\n## Explanation: Firstly, we don't know if the options are mut", "answer": " 6"}

There are 10 students present but absent, so 10 students are in the canteens - 40% of those present.\n2. 3/4 of those present = 30/40 are in the classroom - 75% of the class's present population.\n3. As per 2 above, 21 of those present are in the classrooms - so, 75% of 1/2 of that number is still 57/2 of a student - then, 57 * 75 = 42.75 of those present are in classrooms.\n4. 42.74 present are in classrooms - and so, 1/4 of those present are still 10.67 in classrooms.\n5. So, 10 remaining left = 10(0.67) = 6,7 = 6.7 students.\n6. We know 30 students are present but in the classrooms, we know 1 student in absent but present, we know 10 students are present but are absent, and we assume 30 students are in the classroom.

{"text": "A total of 7 wash cycles are necessary for 3 families of 4 sharing a vacation rental to wash their beach towels, each family having 1 per day for 7 days.\n\n### Explanation of Response: The first step was determining the volume per load that the washing machine could hold. We are given in the problem that the washing machine can hold a total of 14 towels per load, and since each towel is described as \"oversized\", we can assume that a towel's volume equates to that of a load. In other words, the washing machine of the vacation home can hold 14 towel's worth of volume per load.\n\nNow to determine what the total volume of beach towels necessary per family is.\n\nThe first day, each family gets a new beach towel. So the volume per family for that day is 4 beach towels. \n\nThe second day, each family also gets a new beach towels. The total volume for the second day in a family's beach towels is 8 beach towels.\n\nThe third day, each family gets another 4 beach towles per family, so total towel volume in beach towels for the third day is 8 beach towel per family.\n\nThus, by summing these volumes, we see that each family has 8 beach towles on the third day. \n\nWe continue working in this manner. Every day, a family gets a new towel, and by the end of the 7th day each family in the vacation home gets another new towel. Therefore, each family now has 12 beach towel. But, the beach towels do not get any larger each day. So, each family's towel volume can be summed together. \n\nSince 12 beach towels can't fit in a washing machine, each day another 2 are washed for the group totalling at 7 loads of washings.\n\nThus there are 7 wash cycles necessary for each family on the trip of 3 families to wash their towels.\nAnswer: 7.\n\n### Question:What will be 100 percent the minimum number of people at my party?\n\n### Answer", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Tim paid $87 for his visit with the doctor and $60 for his cat\n\n### Demostration:\nThere are a few terms that could confuse someone looking to solve this question in a straightforward manner: \n1. It reads that Tim had insurance that covered 75% of his costs, so presumably Tim and the cat incurred $87.50 between them.\n2. In addition, there are two visits involved, so the solution cannot simply be doubled to account for this, as his pet insurance would have already done that. \n3. Therefore, to find the correct answer, we would need to calculate how much Tim would have spent if his insurance had not covered the costs, and then we would be able to find the amount after his insurance covered some of the cost.\n4. Let's say Tim's insurance covered 70% of the costs, that still leaves us with $57.50 (100% - 70%) that he would need to pay.\n5. We also had mentioned the $60 from pet insurance which was left after deducting the $120 he would pay for his pet's visit.\n6.

Let S represent the time that the hare takes to go 20 feet.  \nThen, let T represent the time the turtle takes to go 2 feet.\n\nWe know that the hare travels 10 feet per second, so in 2 seconds it would travel 20 feet. Then, the turtle travels 10 times slower. So, the turtle will make it in more time if it starts at the same place the hare finishes as the hare reaches the first 10 feet in exactly two seconds, then travels the remaining 10 feet in only one more second.\n\nLet T be the time the turtles take to travel 2 feet. \nThen, from the hare point of view, the turtle takes T + 2 seconds.\n\nThe hare takes 20 seconds (2 + 18) to finish the race. \n\nThe turtle starts 2 seconds after the hare ends so it takes 20 seconds - 2 seconds\n\n20 seconds - 4 = 16 seconds. \n\n20 - 4 = 20 - 20 = 20\n\nThen we solve 20.4 = T (we subtract 2 from both sides because since the turtle starts after the hare finishes)\n\nThen 20.4 == 2\n\n20.4 ==> 2\n\nLet L be the length of the race. Let a be the speed of the hare and b be the speed of the turtle.\nThen a = 1 and b = 0.2 (2 meters/second)\nThen 10(b) + 0 + 20(a) + (a + b)(L - 2) = 10 (a + b)(b) + 10 (a) + 20(b) + (2a + 2b)(a + b)(L)\n\na + b(L - 2) is just the time it takes for both pets to finish the race.\n\n2 + 2(L - 2", "answer": " 18"}

{"text": "The tree grew 10% more in height than before. A 10% increase means an increase of 10 cm for every 100 cm. So, at the end of 1 year, the tree will grow 10 cm. At the end of 2 years, the tree will grow\n20 cm more. So, the end of 11 years we will have 170 cm increase. In 3 years, it will get 48 cm more. So, at the beginning of the 14 year, we will have 218 cm. This is an\n88.8% increase. \n#### Rationales:\n1.At the end of 218 cm, it will not be 100 m anymore, as it increased in height 10% every year. \n2.By simple multiplication we can say that by the end of 2 year 2 x 10 = 20 cm, by the end of 3 years 3 x 10 =48 cm. Now if we just add the increments we got we\ncan calculate the increments. So by the end of 4 years it grew 68 cm from 218. \n3. At the end of the 5 year 5x10 = 50 cm, so at the end of 6 years it grew 138cm. In order to reach 100 meters we just need to subtract the 62cm we already had.

{"text": "Answer choices: Choices A. 20 seconds B. 12.5 seconds C. 25.5 seconds D. 25% less Choice: D. 25.0%.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n#### First, we have to find the number of seconds that the original commercial was, because we have to then subtract that number from the answer choice, and multiply it by 30%. To do this, we have to look for keywords in the question (i.e. we are told that Ursula created a 30 second long commercial.)\n\nWe then have to find what the word % means. We can look at an answer choice if it's in the question itself. A question can only have one answer choice that has % in the answer. (i.e. 5 / 30 %. This question is a multiple question. To answer a multiple choice, you have to find all the answers. The answer choices are 5 / 3, 5/9 and the fraction 5/30. For each answer choice, you have to use rules on fractions, decimals, and percents that are given for any type of math on the test.\n\nIn this question we see that the answer choices are 30 /10. However, we can rule this answer out because 1% of 30 seconds (the desired answer) is 0.3 seconds, not 30 seconds.)\nThis will provide us with the fraction to multiply and substract.\n\nThe answer choices we have are: Choices A. and B. which are both incorrect. In choice A, the fraction we would multiply and substract is 30 seconds divided by 10 seconds or 3. The second answer choice B.\nThe fraction we have to multiply and substract is, 30 - seconds divided by 12.5. That gives us (30/12.5 or roughly 2.37) which should not be the answer in the correct answer.\n\nTo find the correct answer, we have to divide that answer by 30%, or (30/100) Which gives us 1/3 or.33.\n\nTo check if my answer is correct, let's see if an answer choice is wrong as well.

{"text": "The total amount of time Carlotta spends practicing, in addition to throwing tantrums and performing in the final stage performance is 16 minutes.\n\n### Rationale: In order to find the total amount of time that Carlotta spends, we first need to determine the amount of minutes that she spends singing onstage during the final performance. She sings for a total of 6 minutes.\n\nFirst, we assume that she sings for an uninterrupted 6 minutes.\nThe minutes spent singing on stage are 6. Then, we calculate the amount of time that can be subtracted due to the time spent before/after.\n\nWe are interested in how much total time it takes for her to prepare and throw the tantrums for each 6 minutes of singing, so, we subtract 9 minutes from the 6 minutes of singing. Since 3 + 5 are greater than the 6 minutes spent singing, she will perform a tantrum after the 6 minute singing time. Thus, the amount of minutes that Carlotta spents preparing and throwing the tantrums before she sings on stage for 6 minutes is 1 minute.\n\nTherefore, we add one minute for preparation of the tantrums and singing together. Add another 3 minutes for preparation and tantrum throwing, followed by 6 minutes of singing (no preparation). Thus, Carlotta spends a total of 16 minutes on stage practicing, throwing tantrrums, and singing.\n\n### Solution: Carlotta spends the amount of time in minutes that are the sum of 16 minutes, which is 16.\n\n---\n\n### Input I'm taking an air-conditioned train home from campus.

{"text": "### Rationales:\n\n1. The sum of her work, school, and sleep is 12 hours per day. Since this is true, then the total number of hours that she has daily must be 24 hours, as in any given day she has equal amounts of time for all of those activities. By plugging in these values into our equation to get the total number of hours left over for Madeline, we have her total hours daily = 24. 2. Let's break down the answer by considering her activities one by one. Since we are given that she works 8 hours/day, then her time at school and sleep is 16 hours. 3. She works part- time, therefore her total number of hours for work weekly is 20. 4. Our equation for work, school, and time left is:\n\n\\$\\text{Time left over} = 24 \u2013 (9 + 16 + 20)\\$\n\n5.

{"text": "1. The logical approach to solving a question like this is to identify the unknown value of the question then use equations and division to get the answer to the question\n2. Starting with the first equation (the total number of animals is 2x +4 + 56 cows= 2x +9), we find the value of x.\n    \n    x = 56 + 9 -2x  \n    which simplifies to: \n    2x + 0 - 2x = 56 +9 - 2x\n3. This translates to:  \n    2x + x = 56+9 - 2x  \n    (x +x =50)\n4. Now using Subtraction, we can see x = 25.\n5. Next let's look at the 2nd equation (100-10=90 total pigs+goats; if he has 56 animals), we first need to solve for the unknown value (x).\n    \n    x+y=90  \n    x=90-y  \n    100-15 =x  \n    105=x  \n    x=15   \n\n6.

Start with the $128.\n4. Now, let's find the number of dollars it will cover.\n5. We first subtract $4 for the entrance fee.\n6. This leaves $124 towards the cost.\n7. Next, we factor in the entrance fee of $4 and subtract the amount for the entrance fee. \n8. The total price of the strawberries is thus $128, which leaves us with $4 to subtract from the entrance fee.\n9. We now have $124, which leaves $20 for the cost of each pound of strawberry.\n10.

{"text": "The group of ten decides to spend $175 on an end-of-the-year gift for their math teacher. They decide to split this cost equally amongst the group of twelve students. $175 dollars divided by twelve students equals $14.58 per student. Each student therefore spends $14.59 which equals the cost of the gift.\n\n### Explanation of Solution\n1. After the answer was found, we can see that the group is trying to spend $169 before splitting the expenses.\n2. This would allow each student to spend $16 less after the splitting happens.\n3. So after the splitting, each student is left spending $16 for the gift.\n4. So this would cost $16 x 12 for the total of $192, meaning a total of $9 of profit was made from the sale of the gift.\n5.

Calvin's score is thus: 600 + 3 * (625 - 600) / 625 = 525\n\n4. 2 is the difference between 600 and 2 x 625 = (1250 - 2 * 600). \n\n5. 200 is the remainder as 1250 - (2 * (625-600)) % 200 and there is only one possible remainder that is a multiple of 200 (1600,1400,1200,1000,800,600,400, and 200).\n\n6. Thus, the answer is 200, as Paislee would need to have scored 200 points to tie the game. \n\nAnswer: 200 points \n\n### Instructions:In the last basketball game, Sally averaged 16 points per game.

Choices:  a: be quiet b: stop c: don't d: politely start speaking e: say \"you have bad manners\"\n\nRationales:First, we need to interpret the question, which asks us to tell an American that they have behaved rudely to an Australian. This tells us the following information:\n1. An American and Australian are in contact, but the American acted rudely towards the Australian\n2. From this information, we can infer that an American has likely not been taught to treat Australians with respect\n3. The correct answer will describe how to tell an American that Australians expect to be treated with respect without directly insulting their culture.\n4. Option A: \"be quiet\" is unhelpful. While quiet can be seen as polite in some cultures, in Australia \"shut up\" and \"be quiet\" are seen as rude.\n5. Option B\"stop\" is an interesting option, but it could be misconstrued. It should probably say \"stop it\" rather than just \"stop\", especially if there's been rude or threatening behaviour.\n6. Option C: \"don't\" is a useful suggestion, but Australians and Americans generally get along well and aren't at odds with one another.\n7. Option D:\" Politely start speaking\" may convey the right message, but it's not the most succinct. A short blunt statement such as \"you have acted un-Australian\" will convey the message most clearly.\n8. Option E: \"say \"you've got bad manners\" is a useful phrase to", "answer": " 736"}

Choices: \tA: Old bottle of wine B: Water C: Bottle of champagne D: None\nRationales:  1. There is a question mark following the entire statement. This usually indicates that there are no right or correct answers.\n2. The first three statements say nothing about the \"bottle of champagne\". Therefore the only logical conclusion is that water (if it didn't break, lose pressure and seep into the container) and old bottles of wine are items will keep indefinitely.\n3. The last statement states the bottle of champagne, presumed to be filled with champagne, is considered \"none\". This means that the options do not include the bottle of champagned and therefore all are correct.\nTherefore, all of them are possible choices.\nAnswer: All of them are correct\n\n### Input A recent survey found that the average American spends over one month's salary on clothing annually.

{"text": "The question is about Jackson, and his plan to fill the hot tub he is renting. So, the question can be reduced (at least) to \"How much does Jackson spend on champagne if he wants to fill the hot tub rent he is using?\"\n\nAfter reducing the question to only talk about Jackson's spending, I calculate the hot tub volume in gallons, and the cost of each bottle in dollars. This leaves us the amount of champagne needed, and we know he is getting a discount for volume, so discounted champagne is one-fifth of the amount.\n\nThis is a very easy question to answer and there is no way a calculator or any other mathematical tool or manipulation could assist with answering this because one has to first understand and solve the entire question and the answer is provided easily. \n\n### Rationales:\nGiven we have a hot tub that holds 40 gallon (g) of liquid and each bottle can hold 1 quart (q) (there are 4 q/g).

Since the person knows to use a ruler to read a number, they obviously know mathematics.\n\nThere is no reason to use a ruler if one does not know what to look at on it. Therefore it must be implied that the person knows how to read an object they are looking at, so they must also know how to read it with their own eyes (without the telescope).

Therefore, he gets 10,00$ for the week. \n\nNow that we are done with the bonus round, let's think through the bonus round first: \n\n1. Our 3rd player scored 10 more points than the average of his previous 4 games. This is the same in the 4th player. 2: Our 5th player scored 4 fewer points than the average of the previous 4 games, but we already know how many points he scored in his last game, which is 5 more than his previous 2 games. \n2. Our 3 players would have combined to be paid for 84 + (4 x 5) =130 points. 3. Since this is more than the bonus round is offering, we know to subtract this and add 84 for our 2nd player, we get the bonus round award: $130 + 220 = 350 in total, so the player scores 350 dollars instead of $10,900. \n\nNow, let's go back to just the question without thinking about the bonus round: \n\n1: James gets $10,910 in total: (4 x $10,0) + (10 x $8,00)\n\n### Input : What does a dog catch when it plays frisbee?

{"text": "Carla needs to spend a total of 8.99 gallons of gas.\n\n### Rationale:Given the context of the question. Let's list everything out first before breaking down the numbers. \nCarla has a total of 4.62 miles to drive to each location.  1. 8 miles to the store, then 12 miles to the soccer practice, then twice that distance to get to home again. So she has to drive a total of 46.2 miles.  2. The car gets 25 mpg, or 25 miles per one gallon. Therefore, 46.2/25=1.88 gallons.\nNow that we know how much distance to cover, how many stops we make, and how many miles the car will get to the stop, let's plug in the numbers into to formula we know to see how many total gallons we get. As per the formula (gallons used) = (miles between gas stops * mpg / 1000 + total miles driven to all other stops). \nTotal miles driven to all other location: 46.2 and total distance between the gas stations: 8.99. So, gallons used(g) = ((46.2m)*(25/1000) + 8.99)/(1000) = 8.99/1000 =.0899 gallons.\n\nThen, let's calculate the answer. Total gallons (g) divided by number of gallons per 1000 ml (g/1000 mL) = gallons needed(g). So,.0899/3 =.02666667 gallons. So, the number of gas stations to fill up the car is 4.62/3 (.15) gallons.  \nSo, Carla needs to spend a whopping 8.99 \u00f7 3 or.2799 gallons of $.24=$0.59 for the gas.\n(I don't want to waste any space writing out how to calculate it, but yes, the correct option to choose is B:.2799)\n\n### Input, Choices, and Rationale:", "answer": " 5"}
{"text": "If your cost is $2 per ride and the 30-days pass is $50, the least number of times it would have to be used is 25. Rides cannot be shared.\n\n### Rationale:We can do a simple calculation to figure this out. Let's say you are driving your car. $100 dollars to fill up the tank. You get 500miles per tank. The minimum number of trips you would need to take is calculated by dividing the cost of the pass (50) by the cost of rides (2). 50/2 = 25. 50/3 = 16.66. 50/4 = 12.5. So, if you want to use the pass, it will be strictly cheaper per ride. You got it!\n\n### Rationales 1:If you're using the pass instead of riding the bus, you're going to take a lot more rides per day than most people. For example, a typical bus trip would be about 1-2 rides to and from work daily, and 1 or 0 rides to the grocery store, and maybe an evening trip back home. On the other hand, getting a 30-day bus pass means you probably won't have a car for 30 days or drive at all, \nusing it every 2.5 days.

First, consider the context of the problem. There are 90 students at an elementary school, with each student having a total of 7 siblings, with each of their siblings having 4 teeth.\n2. The sum of all the students totals 90, so that means each student has a total of 738 + 4 + 4 = 746 siblings.\n3. Next, the sum of the siblings totals 739 because each sibling has 4 teeth each.\n4. So, we know that each student has 738 siblings, and those siblings have a total of 748 teeth ( 739 + 4 = 4 - 4 = 738).\n5. Since the total number of siblings of the students adds up to 738 for each student.\n6.  And the total number of teeth each sibling has is 748.\n7.  This means that each student will have 56 ( 748 / 738 = 56) sibling teeth and 1 (1 / 738) of their own teeth.\n8.

{"text": "1. Let the total depth of the snowdrift be represented by T. Let the initial depth, or starting depth, be represented by S.\n2. We know that the initial depth was 16 inches deep at the start of the day.\n3. We also know that the depth increased by 18 inches on the fourth day, and 30 on the third day. That means that the total depth increased by 54 inches: 18 + 34 = 54. \n4. This leaves us with the fact that the total depth of the drift increased by 54. 54 represents the difference between 54 inches, which is the drift's total depth at the end of the third day, and zero, which is the drifts's starting depth, also known as the initial depth. \n5. Thus, the additional depth during the fourth day is simply 30 inches.\n6. We know that the depth of the snowdraft grew by 54 inches on the third and fourth day. \n7. Thus, we want to find out the starting depth, or \"initial\" depth. \n8. Therefore, (S - 18) + 30, which equates to (76 - 30) + 34 = (46 + 34) = 80 = T. \n9.

When we study language at the university, we mostly study a native speaker's English.  When I began working, the Japanese are often unsure of how to speak to a foreigner when the foreigner speaks Japanese.  I have found that the Japanese think most Americans speak very fast.   When I speak to them, my speech is slower than most Americans,  and they speak slower than I do.  After I show them that my speech is not very fast, why do they talk even slower than usual?\n\n### Dem :It can lead an inefficient communication method because sometimes when a person is speaking to another person, and they both speak at high speed, it might be difficult to know when the other person is done because it is unclear the other person is done if both of them speak quickly. The example of this person's experience is why the Japanese do not speak slowly to a foreigner who they think will speak at high speed that is actually slow for a native speaker. \n\n### Input  : I'm going to watch a movie tonight.

Renting a VCR lets you see a new movie without long lines.

{"text": "Her taxes were $23\n\n### Clarification:\nIn the question, we have the information that Angeline is part of a household where expenses are shared. She pays $42 per month for necessities. Her salary is $80 per month, and she also pays her share of taxes.\n\nAfter the end of the month, Angeline has $18 left over after her taxes and necessities. We can see that these two options are inconsistent with her taxes payment and household expenses. \n\nAssuming the $42 is used for expenses, we can see that Angeline must have paid $29 + $20 + $21 (tax) = $60 in total, or $26 more than left over, which clearly is impossible.\n\nThis means that $60 can only be for her earnings.\n\nThus, our answer is:\n\nAngeline had to pay $20 for necessities.\nShe had left over $16 after that.\nAngeline also paid $21 in taxes, so her contribution to the household taxes came to $37.\nThus, the taxes was $23.\n\n### Input\n```\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\n2x + 3x + 4x + 5x = 14\nFour times 6 + Five times 3 = 26\n18x - 8y = 30\n7a - 2b = -22\n\n20 - 1x = 10\n80 + 1.5x = 225\n\nFour more than 40 = 40 + 4 = 44\n\nA boy is 9 months older than his sister.

A family buys 10 boxes of cereal, 2 bags of bread, and 4 gallons of milk. How much did the family save?\n\n### Rationale: The grocer's sign says buy one, get one and it says each item counts as one. The family buys 12 boxes of cereal which cost 10 dollars. Each box costs one dollar so add one more dollar to the cost of every box. That gives us 110 dollars. We also need bread. The price of bread per bag is X dollars. The family bought two bags of bread. We need to multiply 2 by the number of the bread which is X. The price that we get is 2*X dollars. Next we need to find the number of gallons of milk that was purchased. Each gallon of milk is Y dollars. We need to find X multiplied by Y. That's 2*y dollars. It is not specified how many pounds of bread and cereal are in each box, so we need to find the total number in the family's possession. If the family had the boxes, it is the same as the number of bags of bread and gallons of milk. However, this is not true. The total number in their possession is 12X+2Y+4X+10X which we will keep written for the rest of the problem. (12X+2*Y+4*X+10X).

Winning isn' t everything because this sentence makes it seem like winning is a lot and winning isn't everything in the context of this sentence because everyone wants to win and it is not necessary\n2) C also can't be correct because winning isn't everything because this sentence makes the winning spirit seem like it's bad because it's not all there is to wanting to win\n3) D also can't be it, either. Because winning competitions is in the context meaning the person is competing so I can't be correct\n4) We can also eliminate E because this sentence makes it sound like wanting to win is a waste and winning isn't always everything, so this sentence would make it seem like you would always give up, so this sentence isn't what the person said\n5) So finally, we know that answer A.

{"text": "5\n\n### Input\nIn the picture below, there is an equal line between each box.

In this case, the census workers state that nobody's house survived the 1917 Chicago Fire. This means that if you're asking about the number of houses that survived, then the answer has to be 1,386.\n* B) Houses in a particular census year cannot have been burned down. This means that nobody in Chicago could have had their house burned down between 1916 and 1926. If 1,500 houses were burned down that year, then nobody had their house burned in Chicago.

{"text": "Mr. Caiden would have to pay $222.00 for the remaining metal roofings.\n\n### Explanations for the logic:\n\n### Demand: Consider all the things that he might purchase using the $388.00 he is given.\n\n1. Firstly, consider that the metal roofing that the supplier is giving away is free, which means it is part of the $388 he is given to. That means that the number of feet the supplier is giving him is not considered when he wants to have 300 overall feet of metal roofing.\n2. Mr. Caiden is given $388. That means he can simply buy $388 of things. Consider that he wants to buy a product for $350 and $30 to buy the material for his metal roofing. Therefore, he is left with $8.44 left to spend.\n3. Consider that Mr. Caiden wants 300 feet. Since he has already gotten one for free from the supplier, he would need 301 feet. Consider now that the 1 foot costs $8, the last foot would cost around $8.01.\n4. This means that the last foot would be around $8.02. \n5. Consider that Mr. Cain must pay $8.02 for the last foot. If he bought 299 feet of metal roofing, he would have $1.02 left over. Consider that the supplier is bringing 1 more foot of the remaining metal roofing. This would cost him an additional $1.03. This money would be spent by Mr. Caiden.\n6. That would bring him up to $2.05, which would now mean that he needs to spend another $222.\n7. Consider finally that he had a total of $8, $350, $30 for the supplier, $204.75 of his remaining $2.05 and the $222 he is trying to pay for. Since he does not have the money, the supplier is not able to provide him with these.\n8. That leaves Mr. Caiden needing $222 for the metal roofing.\n9. Therefore, Mr. Caiden needs to spend $222", "answer": " 400"}

{"text": "The answer is: 49.45kg.\n### Demonstraion:\n1. Find the difference: The shop sold 29 + 17 = 46 bags of potatoes altogether. Then: 29 + 46 = 75kg total. Now subtracting 46 from 75 yields 29.\n2. Now divide 29 by 2 since there are two morning's worth of potatoes. 29 \u00f7 2 = 14.5kg\n3. Therefore: 75 - 29 = 46\n3. Now add the two morning's worth\n4. 75 + 14.5 = 89.5kg\n5. After this, take the one afternoon's worth and add it to the overall total.\n6. 89.5 + 17 =96.5kg\n7. Now we are left with figuring out who many bags of potatoes there were that day, so we can then find the quantity.\n8. Since we started with 46 bags, and now we've accounted for 46 + 17, there are 63 bags of potatoes over 2 days.\n9. Then, we simply take the quantity per bag and multiply by how many bags we have, so 75kg \u00f7 7kg, and then multiplied by 63.\n10.

Your response should incorporate an appropriate, complex analysis into it along with specific rationale for your responses.\n\n### Response\n```\nIn my opinion, the answer to this task in questioning is \u201cE: I don\u2019t have enough information to evaluate.\u201d The reason why the answer in my mind is not \u201cB,\u201d \u201cC\u201d or \u201cD,\u201d is because, the question does not tell us when it is 9 o\u2019clock, or what the month is. So in my mind, we don\u2019t know when 9 o\u2019clock is, and since the month is not mentioned, it could be a month with any day, or it could be a day with no month. \nEven though this answer choice is the incorrect one, this is the closest answer in my opinion, due to the way of explaining a rhetorical device, in which is the use of irony. But, if you were to use irony, you need to incorporate a pun, and you don\u2019t know the time, or the month. \nAlso in this task, the question is not specific. It does not tell the reader what was used. Like, the answer, or the object that the 1.5 cups of oil was used in, which is why the answer \u201cB: Oil\u201d is not right to this question. The reason why I think answer\u201d C\u201d is not either, is because, the reader is not told the size of the pan. \n\nIn my opinion, after this question was responded to me, I can now answer this question without looking at it again, from the fact that we don\u2019t know the exact time it was 9 o\u2019clock at in the morning or 9 o clock at in the evening. Therefore, since we don\u2019t know what the month is, the season that might have been during the month, and what objects or utensils are involved in the question, I think the best answer is \u201cE: I can\u2019t evaluate this question properly.\u201d \n\nAlso after giving my answer for the question, I would like another person to give me theirs in order to clarify that I answered correctly or incorrectly.\n```", "answer": " 7"}

First, consider any factors that could change the answer. The word 'french fries' indicates that we are talking about freshly cooked fries, perhaps with any remaining salt still on it. It is unlikely that this person is using a ton of salt to cook the fries, considering the amount of fries it is expected to cook.  \n2. Next, consider which choice best describes the scenario. In the scenario, Bill added the fries to the oven after it was heated. The only choice that meets these requirements is option A - 'he hadn't added too many pounds'\n3. Finally, let's look into which choice is the most logical. Based on the premise, it makes sense that Bill didn't add too many pounds of salt because the premise gives the reasoning behind it. If there were more than that, the recommendation would still be accurate even if he didn't use all of it.\n4.

Drivers on the 105 need to get off 101 at the soonest opportunity. 3. Local drivers should avoid driving on the 103 expressway. 4. John needs to find a better way to get from one place to another. 5.

While it is true that the other modes of transit may be very safe, the conclusion doesn't state that, and it's not the point. 2. While it may be true that drivers should get off at the soonest opportunity, there is no evidence presented to support this claim, and it doesn't make sense. 3.

{"text": "Jeanne has 5 regular tickets. She should buy 4 tickets so she has the total of 9 tickets and 9/5 equals 1.8. That is the total of the tickets to ride all three attractions together.\n\n### Rationale: First we will start by determining how many total tickets are needed to ride all three attraktion. We can solve for this by doing 5(5)+4(4)+4(4)=28. The total of all the tickets we have here is 83. Jeanne is missing 2 tickets to fill in the gap. So she would need to buy 10 more tickets to make up the 83-5=78.\n\n### Response A's Rationale: We can eliminate three of the options because they are not part of the ticket problem. We can't use \"none\" because Jeanne has to buy some more.\n\nWe can't use \"fourteen\" because it's too many. That means we are left with \"seventeen\" and \"one\". Now we have to compare them to the answer options. Answer choice \"none\" is not one of the options we came up with originally, so we will eliminate it and move to \"seventeen.\" Seventeen is not the same as 83 because it is too many. \"One\" would equal to Jeanne buying the total of 83 tickets, which is one too many, so we will eliminate \"one\" and go with choice B's answer: \"seventeen.\"\n\n### Rational : Jeanne would not have 83 tickets if she bought more than seventeen more tickets. Jeanne had 5 tickets and got 78 more tickets. 83-5 = 78. 83 = seventeen more tickets (ex. 90, 78, 5, 18 ). Answer: choice B because Jeanne bought 78 more tickests and not 83 tickets", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Jenny ate 75 chocolate squares.\n\n### Rationale to explain your calculation: The first thing we need to determine is how Jenny feels a pain so it means the number, 75, is not a whole number. Jenny feels a pain. This is what she is feeling, which is indescribable. If it were, she would not be feeling pain but feeling the word. I would like to say that this number is not a whole number, it is not an integer. What is it then? It is the sum of two whole numbers. There is a reason why I say 75 is uncountable: it can represent any two whole numbers that make it a whole number; any time there is a gap, that represents a place, for example, a cup can hold any number of water. That is the reason why the answer is 75, any two consecutive numbers that you can count will make it a whole number. In this case, 42 and 33 is the best option because it is a natural number. How is there a negative in the calculation? A negative means that something is missing, in this case, 33 and 42, they are all missing from the calculation, so in order to put them there or to add them back you would subtract or make them negative. This can be explained by using any mathematical example. For instance, in the equation x+y+2, the 2 is always positive; it doesn't mean that there is 3 and 1 but rather 2 and 1; it is positive no matter how you look at it. This is because it is part of the summation, like every other number, all of them. 137 is one more than 7 but the 7 is higher in comparison to 1; in this case, 137 is the total but when we start to count up, 7 is higher, it's where is the whole process started from.

{"text": "The correct answer is A: $5\n\n### Solution:\nThe correct answer in this question is choice A: $5. We begin by understanding the relationship between the price of the tickets and the time spent in the theatre. As we've been informed, the price stands at $5 for every hour spent there. Therefore, the number of tickets a person will purchase will be based on the number of hours spent in the theatre.\n\nFrom here, we need to understand how many hours a person will spend in the theatre. We can do this by multiplying the number of months (i.e., 6) by 3. From here, we simply subtract the initial price ($25) to find that the number of tickets sold can be calculated with an equation: [ticket price (i.e., $5)] * [hours purchased (i.e., x6)] = $5 * 3 = $15.\n\nFrom here it is easy to solve for the variable and find that the answer is choice A: $15.", "answer": " 90"}

Cash sales are done by giving money directly to the person making the purchase, whereas credit sales instead mean the person can pay for the purchase later by either paying it off at once or making installments.

The 11th trip is when Caleb and Cindy both carry their buckets to the pool at the same time.\n\n### Input \uff1a\n\n[30, 5 ]\n\n### Reponse \uff1a\n\nThere is no solution to this problem. Since the length of 5 is greater than the width of 30, the area  of the triangle is less than 30 square. When the product of a number(n) and the absolute value(M) of this number is greater than n times m, it is considered an impossible solution.\n\n[40, 3 ]\n\n### Response \uff1a\n\nWhen the product of a number and its absolute value is more than n times m. Since both parameters are less than 40, the values are considered impossible.\n\n### Rational \uff1a\n\nSince both parameters are less than the threshold value, it is difficult to calculate whether the area of triangle is less than 40 square. So the values are considered impossible solutions.\n\n### The first two pictures indicate  that 10,000 cubic meters of ice are stacked in a pyramid. The second picture shows  that each cube weighs 5,000 pounds, or 2,267.98 kilograms.  A 500-square-meter building requires 10,099 square feet of flooring. If we stack every cubic meter of ice (volume of one meter cube = 1 cubic meter) on top of each other, we could fill the space where flooring should be with a large pile of ice. What is the difference in the weight of each floor if a building's flooring is made of ice cubes stacked on top of each other in the building?\n\n### \n\n10,009 square feet of floors are made of ice.

At all times, the left enclosure is twice as large as the right enclosure. The dog then chases another dog out of that enclosure to the outside of the kennel. At first glance, none of the dog's actions seem logical. That is, as the dog moves, it appears as though a dog outside the enclosure in a 0-dimensional space is moving randomly in an unpredictable manner.\nYou have decided to create the 0-dimensional space to see what the dog is doing by creating lines of an equal distance from each other. You create enough lines to create a 0-dimensional object so that a space can be represented. For example, if lines spaced 0.26 inches apart are placed together, you will be creating a cube. Each line represents the surface of each side of the cube. If you would place lines 0.52 inches apart, you would be creating a sphere. You can continue to create objects by increasing the number of lines. You can create any object that you can imagine.\n\nYou then see a math professor and your teacher working on an equation. You discover that the equation relates to how far each of the animals traveled. The dog in the enclosure is moving at 1 unit per second (miles per day, in any linear measurement). The dog from the kennel is moving at 1.5 units per second. So, how many units did the second dog move per second?\n\nOutput: 1.5\n\nInput:If a person runs four miles and the dog walks it, it will take exactly how many minutes?\nOutput:35\n\nInput:A man walks into a museum and looks at the paintings and the sculptures inside.

{"text": "1 chicken\n\nInput: The old lady found the numbers 4, 5, 1, 5, 5, and 7 hidden in some baked goods and had to figure out how to arrange these numbers in a sum less than a certain amount to get the answer. She first took 5, the middle number of the series, and added it to the first and last number in the series to find that the sum of 4 + 5 = 9. She then subtracted the first number from the last number. She now had the result: 4 + 4 = 8. The next step was to take the number closest to 1, which turned out to be 5. Next, she subtracted the middle number from the answer to get 3. Now, only 1 more number remained. She knew there were several ways to add the middle number with the answer with the remaining number, but the only way that resulted in a sum greater than 3 is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

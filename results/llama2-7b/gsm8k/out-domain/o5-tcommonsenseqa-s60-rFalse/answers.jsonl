{"text": "Because of a misunderstanding of what Albert is trying to do, it appears that the student has missed the point or, at least, was too distracted to perform a simple computation to solve the problem. In this case, it appears to be a matter of reading and comprehension, not a lack of skills.\n\n### Alternative Answer:\n\nIt is possible, that the above response could have been corrected. The student could be told to think of how many slices he would eat each day and then how much pizza he would need to get that number of slices.\n\n#### Response\nAs mentioned, the student inadvertently omitted a step from completing the assigned task. Specifically, the student needs to show his or her work from start to finish.\n\n### Lesson\nIt is important to provide feedback on correct responses that will help the student understand how to properly perform the task, not just how to complete the task.\n\n### Input\nBetty likes to have a snack after school. One day she ate 5 pizzas. Then she ate 4 pizzas. How many pizzas did she eat on that school day?\n\n## Response\nBetty ate 4 pizza the first day. Then she ate two more pizza the next day. It is unneeded to complete the question, but if I had to figure it out, I would have Betty consume 4 pizzas on the first day and 4 more on the second, so she would have eaten 8 pizzas in the same school day, one day and the next.\n\n### Response\nWhen Betty ate 4 pizadas on the first day and then 4 more pizza on the next day, the total of pizza she ate was 8. That total is the same the teacher wanted us to solve.\n\n### Reference\n\nTony Fry.

But in English we normally write how many ways there are.\n\n### I/O Input:\n\n- First we have a word that means two solutions:\n\n```\nThere are two ways to get to the school from this side of town.\n```\n- The second word we have is \"two\":\n\n```\nTwo people are left in the jail with the thief.\n```\n\n### I-O Example 3\n\nA house has 20 windows. There are 72 ways to rearrange them, so they all face the same direction. How many possible combinations are there for a window on the right side of the house, a window in the back,\nand a smaller window on the bottom right corner of the house?\n\nAnswer: First, there are 20 windows, so we multiply 72 (possible combinations) by 20 (windows). We have to do the other part also. The other part is (The house has 20, for every 5 windows in length it has 5 possibilities with 10 windows in length, with five more spaces open to put any of the ten windows from the 20 windows in length to add to have 15 windows in length. Then the last 5 we add to have 10 windows", "answer": " 310"}

{"text": "Answer: 1250 domestic wine bottles and 1200 imported wine bottles\n\n### Coding logic\nWhenever you are reading through a test case you should always follow a \"walk through\" procedure, which is to first imagine every line of the test case as a separate code block. Once you have gotten this \"picture\" of everything that needs to happen it becomes easier to see the problems that could arise. \nThen once you have a picture, write your code in a way that it flows through the test cases. It should be able to go through a test case without causing an error. \nFinally, once you have gotten this far, make sure you add some sort of exit to the code that is a way for a user to tell the code when to quit (i.e., a print statement). Doing so will help keep your code cleaner and easy to read! \n\n### Challenges\n1. I encountered trouble with my logic for the question where the answer was solidity. The code I had written for the question included \"if i is not None and i!= 0 else\" but the expected output was 0. In this case I realized that my if statement was actually wrong. I tried to use the same logic but change the values so that it made the problem easier and the logic right. After some trial and error I was able to understand that the way the question asked was not the way I initially approached it. The question gave the answer first and then it moved to ask the question so the way I approached it was wrong. For any logical challenges, make sure that you keep looking at the problems from a few angles. This helped me recognize what was wrong with my initial strategy.\n\n2. Another challenge I faced was making the output display show progress. Using the code from the first question I began to code what would happen if we had to display progress in addition to the answer. I used the 'print' function, but the 'print' function did not display the progress we were making (I used a for loop that counted up each time through). Instead I looked at other methods such as'sys.stdout.write' this worked because I placed each 'print' function into the sys.stdout.write function.  This helped the 'print' function act the same way as a'sys.stdout.writeline' would. With the way I used'sys.stdout.printline", "answer": " 2400"}

I can offer some help with some hints. 1. Write a system of equations and then solve. (The question hints at the equations you will need. To show this, we create two equations, which means we will be adding these to get one equation (solution). In our example it was: $$ x_{1}+x_{2}=\\text{5% of 2500}$$ $$ x_{1}+\\text{5% of}\\ 2500= x_{2}.$$ We know the solution is $x_{2}=0$ so all the added sugar could possibly be from the soft drink. (We did not know this when we started, so if we could we should get more information.) The soft drink had 2500. Multiply 2500 so you get 2500 x 1 in order to convert the percent to a number. Also the bar of candy was 25 calories. Now $2500 x1$ is 2500 since the percent was 5. But 2500 divided by 25 calories is 100.

Make a note for how much one pays on a loan, the more they borrow the more interest they pay 2. The rate is the multiplier that the amount you borrow by to show how much interest is paid.\n\n### Worked example: Suppose you have $1,500 to pay for expenses, one example is groceries.\n\n#### 1. Your income is $1,000. How long would this amount last if you are given $200 per week?\n\n#### 2. What is the rate?\n#### 3. The rate is 3, which means that you earn $200 for every three weeks that you work.\n\n### Challenge answer: $300 x 3 equals $900\n\n### Instrumental response example: Suppose you had to borrow money for your grocery store. The 1,500 you have is not enough so you ask for a loan, you are given you $750 but have to pay $100 interest. That means you have to spend 750 + (100% of 750).

He decided to have appetizers, entree, salad, and dessert. The appetizers got served on small cocktail plates, but the main dishes got servied on large 12\" plates. He was sure to have a full selection on hand to satisfy any whim of his 30 guests. However, he didn't expect his guests to bring food, and there were enough left over leftover food that it was eaten by the 30 people as well as some friends who came in after the party. Wickham was impressed by his own skill at feeding guests, and decided to throw the biggest party the following year that he could.\nWickham hosted another Christmas party the following year with the exact same guest count. He made the recipe for his popular mashed potatoes even bigger and served it on bigger plates. Guests also brought food to pass that year, but he didn't serve any of the food. After the party he realized that he had cooked even more dishes for that party than he previously.\nHaving enjoyed how successful his party was, Wickham decided to host 300 guests at this years party. He decided to have them get in line by the entrees so that the food could all be served at the same time as opposed to the previous years line of guests getting one course at a time while waiting for the next course. Guests all brought food to pass, but it was too much for his guests to eat so he ended up hosting another party to eat all the leftover food.  \nWickham is throwing the biggest Christmas party for a large group, with many courses and people bringing food to pass as well.

{"text": "To arrive at an answer that takes into account for how much was paid for the strawberry picking, I would assume that there would need to be a mathematical equation used to arrive at Sally's, Jenny's, and Moses' harvest. Using the given information, and assuming that there is a price of $20 for each pound of strawberry and $128 was paid for their harvest, we can then solve the following equation: $128 = 128p * ($20 / $128)\n\nThe standard price is not an issue here as the standard price for Sally, Jenny, and Moses' strawberries would be $20. In the scenario the given information also indicates that Sally, Jenny's and Moses paid $128 and had to pick strawberries to arrive at their total bill. The math equation should be something of the form $128 = Px * ($20 / (miles/pounds)) where P represents the number of strawberries picked and m represents the price of strawberry harvest. As such, with the information given the math equation for Sally, Jenry and Moses would be $128 = (40x * ($20/400)) because they picked four hundred strawberries in total.

{"text": "You cannot use numbers such as 1/4, which we can also write as 0.25, since we are not using a decimal. This is why we write in fractions. The answer is 1250 kids in camp.\n\n### Input There are 7500 birds sitting on top of the tree. 1/3 of those birds are eagles, and 1/8 of the eagles are sitting in the back. How many birds are sitting in the back?\n\n### How to Answer: Since we know that 1/3 of the birds are eagles so that means that 2,600 are not eagles. 1/8 of that number is 300. So the answer is 300 birds are sitting in the tree branch.\n\n### Bonus Question: \n\n### How do I know that 1250 are kids who went to soccer camp in camp, when I know that 7500 are kids in camp?\n\n### Answer: Since your first sentence doesn't match the amount of how many kids there in the camp, you have to subtract the total amount of kids that were in camp without the kids that went to soccer camp (1250 out of 7500) by the amount of kids that went to day soccer camp (750 out of 1250).\n\n### How would you think if you had to solve a problem with letters?\n\n### Bonuses\n### How to Add\nAdd 12 + 24\nYou can add by changing it to 12(x) so (12)(x)+24(x). You solve for x by (12)(x)/4 and do 10/4 to get the answer.\n\n### How To Add Subtract\nYou change the equation to be x(9) - 5. So 9(x) - 5x. So you can add 8x's and x's and make it easier. 9(x) = 9x + 9x so that is 9(x) which means you add 8(x) and then divide each number by 8 and then you will get your answer as 5x.\n\n##", "answer": " 2000"}

{"text": "I found that in order to get this answer we would have to use the proportion method to solve. This method tells us that you take the whole set and break it into equal groups, then you take the smaller set and put it in one of those equal groups. From there you can figure out the percent of the smaller set in the larger set. Lets look at this using an example below:\n\nProportion is used whenever people are talking about a part of a whole and how much of that part is a part of the whole. So, the fraction is 20%, because there are 20 frogs less than there used to be. \n\nLets look at the proportion method in an example. A group of 8 people had been working on a project, now 3 people quit. The part that is left of the 8 people, is now 5/8. And this means that the part that isn't left, is two thirds of 8 people, hence 6/8\n\nLets take a look at this in a visual representation like so:\n![A picture using the proportion method](image/frog-1462597_1280.jpg)\n\nWith this information, we are able to take each fraction and turn it into a percent. This is because every percent is made of a fraction. Percent meaning, what percent of the whole? So, when it comes to this problem we have two fractions on each side to figure out the percent on each side, once we know the part we know the whole.\n\nSo, 5/8 means the first half of the whole is left. Likewise, 3/8 means the last half of the whole is not left. 3/8 also means that 2/8 of the whole is left, and this means that the first two quarters of the whole are not left.\n\nWe will put these fractions into percent format:\n\n\\begin{code}\n50/80 = 0.625\n30/80 =  0.375\n20/80 =   0.250\n10/80 =    0.125\n\\end{code}\n\nThis is an alternative way to do the problem:\n\n\\begin {equation}\n(100-10/100 -1", "answer": " 81"}

From a quick glance around the neighborhood, he saw 12 total trucks and 33 cars, adding up to 45 wheeled vehicles. But according to his calculations, since there was 4 whees on each truck and 4 wheels on each car, he counted 48 total wheels. Since he started with 12 total tricks and ended with 48 total wheeled vehicles, there must be 36 more wheels than what he counted. Because he only counted 45 wheeels and not 48 wheels.

{"text": "James has an old printer that always crumples the 7th page and blurs the 3rd. Now he has 42 pages. If the 7th one is always crumpled then James has had 68 pages.

{"text": "If you knew that 25 minutes were taken for part 1, and it took twice as much time for part 2, this would put 50minutes into part 2 alone. If you put the time used for part 1 on top of part 2 you would have 1 hour, then to equal the 2 hours you would have to put 2 more into part 3.\nSo, 50+2=52minutes used for part 2 and 52+2=54 minute used for part 3. This would amount in a total of 106 minutes, 1hour, 44minutes used in total. However, this isn't correct! Since if he took the time of 25 minutes to finish part 1 he would have used 54 minutes to finish part 3. This puts 29 minutes left.

Then they would be asked to work on how 15 cases being sold in the same day would affect them? And then also show how changing that one to a case being sold each day would look.\n\n### Output\n\nInput: The store sells cases of  juice daily.

{"text": "The answer is: 21.\n\n### Solution:\nCecile bought 4 apples. Diane bought 16 apples. 15 + 16 = 31. The teachers wanted the step-by-step calculations to solve, you can do it the same way or in your own way but I'll include below.\n\nIn order to solve this you first need to understand this problem: (Cecile + Diane) = 31. I know you can do it but to show you the steps that they wanted I'll include them.\n\n1. Make the groups: (Cecile15 + (16-15)) = (Cecile5+1) = 4\n2. Sum up Group 1: Cecile + Diane = 4+16 = 20, therefore we have to add: 20+2 = 22, therefore (Cecile+Diane) = 20\n3. Now: (20+0) = 20, 1=1: Cecile+Diane=31, therefore (Cecilediane) =31\n4. Now: (10+2) = 12=22: (Ceciledianed)+9 = 40, therefore (Cecipeciledianed)=40\n5. Now: 0+16 = 16=40: (Ceecilediane + Diane) =101, therefoer Diane = 10\n6.

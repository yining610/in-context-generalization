Choices: A: apartment B: castle C: home D: tower E: mansion\nRationales: Steps 1 & 2: The paragraph says that the mouse lived in his house. \nStep 3: In consideration of the options, 'castle' doesn't fit because a mouse cannot live in a castle. This is because castles are for people to live in.\nStep 4 & 5: 'Home' doesn't sound ideal. It either needs to be more specific, or should be relevant to the 'house' referred to in the paragraph. \nStep 6: 'Tower' is not the correct answer either. A tower is a high, narrow tower in a castle for people to live in, where a mouse could not live. \nStep 7: Thus, if we eliminate the options that don't fit in consideration of the questions, it becomes clear that 'Mansion' is the correct answer. A mansion is a very large house and if the person who works there is a mouse then it is likely that the mouse lives in the mansion. \nStep 8: A mansion is usually where people of a higher social class live. \nStep1: The paragraph doesn't refer to a specific social class so it's impossible to say whether the mouse is part of a higher social class. This is because social class and money does not always have a clear difference. \nStep 2: The paragraph doesn's refer to a social class or money so it cannot be said why the mouse lives in the'mansion'. \nStep 3&4: The paragraph doesn'represent whether the person is poor, rich or middle class. \nStep 5: The passage doesn'refer to the mouse being the only one in the house. \nStep6: The mouse does not do work because he is not working in a farm. \nStep7: This", "answer": " 121"}

B: forests\nRationales: What is the source of water? Choices:  Let's begin with the answer A to see if it is correct.\nWhen we refer to the earth as the \"majority of the earth\", then the source of water is the planet Earth.\nThe answer A is not correct because we use \"the earth\" to refer to the entire planet. Hence, we need to consider the next choices: B, C, D, and E.\nIn the question, the phrase \"what is the main source of....\" implies a single location. Hence, it will not be the ground, nor will it be the mountains. \nWe should also consider the context of the question: we are looking for a singular source. If we refer to a river or a lake as a source, it refers to a large body of water. In this context, we may not be able to find the source as it does not refer to a singular location. We can only consider forests and the earth. Let's start with the forests. \nChoice \"B: forests\" is not the main source of water since there are water sources in forests such as rivers, and water sources in rivers and lakes.

Help her reschedule the classes 2. Get upset and angry too 3. Let her be instead of getting involved 4. Try to reschedule the classes on her own 5. Try not to care\nRationales: We are looking for options that best match the response that would provide the most empathy to a friend who was being negatively impacted by rescheduling classes.\n1. This option suggests that we should try to help her get it as soon as possible. This would provide the most support to a teacher because she could feel that she is not alone in dealing with this problem and someone is on her side.\n2. This would provide lesser empathy because to try to reschedule the class on her own could feel like she is being left alone to deal with a problem she might not be able to solve.\n3. This could be interpreted as an indication that we should try not to get involved in the issue. This would be an unhelpful response because it would feel isolating and lonely.\n4. This appears to be the least helpful of all the options because the statement suggests that we should reschedule the classes without looking after the teacher's well-being.\n5.

Look at each answer choice and determine if it fits with handbooks we know contain instructions, suggestions, regulations, advice, opinions, and/or rules.\n3.

Make a choice.\nIt is important that we fully consider each choice, as the task requires that we eliminate all but one choice in order to make a final decision.\n\nSo let's begin by looking at our choices in order.\n1. Instructions - A handbook does contain instructions, but the answer choice is too broad, as this could easily mean that anything in the handbook could only contain instructions. \n2. Opinions - Similarly as above, any content written in a handbook could be classified as an opinion by some, but this is too broad, especially as we know handbooks are used to instruct and provide rules. \n3.

Choices: 1. A: I was not qualified 2. B: you were not ready 3. C: I was not skilled 4. D: you were not capable 5. E: You were not eligible\nRationales: Option E is wrong because the boss did not prevent the employee from working on their dream.\nOption A says you have to be qualified to work on a dream.\nOption B says you have to be ready to work on a dream: that is, you have to be qualified, skilled, and/or have the experience to work on the dream.\nOption C says you have to be skilled to work on a dream, which is a subset of the dream's requirements. You can be incapable, but still be qualified for a dream.\nOption D is more similar to the employee's explanation than they seem at first glance: this choice is about whether the employee was capable or not. However, option D goes backward in time--how could you not be capable? The logical reasoning in option D is backwards for the context of the question, so option D is incorrect.\nOption D is a better choice because the employee in this hypothetical question wants to work for their dream, not on it.

'Pacific ocean' is not applicable as its waters are frequented by whales not by sharks. \nStep 8: 'Mediterranean sea' is also not a suitable answer because there's nothing to indicate that betting with a sharks is done during the times of Roman empire, the era in which the sea is located. Therefore, 'pool hall' is the only one left, being a place where people come to play games.\nStep 9: Based on logic and the context of the question, 'pool hall' makes the most sense, so the answer is C: pool hall.\nAnswer: C.pool hall\n\nInput: The fish are being raised here to what end?

While it is a part of the word 'chunky', it is not part of the word thin.\nD: meat. Since it is part of the word 'beef', it matches the rule to the second letter of the word. \n\nE: cheese isn't part of the word 'choc' which we are trying to find.

Choices:  [ ] A: spell casting [ ] B: time management [ ] C: spelling [ ] D: thinking [ ] E: money management\nRationales: In  Step 1: \"What does the wizard find\" hints at having an issue or dilemma with something\nStep 2: From \"is often difficult\", \"difficult\" means \"hard to do\", as in, hard to do something often, so one might need to work at it repeatedly.\nStep 3. From the sentence, \"find\" means \"learn about it\", \"find\" is in the past simple tense, which means the issue/dilemma has been identified in the past.\nStep 4 We have a few options to choose from.\nI. \"spell casting\" is a magical power given by God.\nII. \"time management\" = difficulty = hard to manage.\nWe only need to choose \"hard to manage\" if \"spell casting\" has  been used in the sentence already.\nStep 5 If (II) is an option, then (III) should've been the correct answer, but it's not one of the options.\nStep 6 To solve the dilemma, you need to use \"management\". So, \"time management\" doesn't make sense because a wizard finds it hard to always \"manage\" time.\nStep 7 The answer has to be \"money management\",  if \"time management\" can't work, the only left is \"money management\". So, (IV) & (V) makes the sentence makes sense.\nStep 8 Then \"money management\" makes the sentence gramatically correct.\nStep 9 Hence, the answer is \"money management.\" Choices: C, D, and E.\nAnswer: C, D, E: Time management, thinking, money management", "answer": " 15"}

The result of his finding was a positive one. Which result might not be true? Choices:  D: he is a scientist A: he conducted various experiments B: he performed various experiments C: he conducted tests D: he performed experiments\nRationales: Let's first go through the answer options. \nOption A: 'he is a scientist' = We already know that scientist conducted experiments in the previous sentence. Therefore, the word 'he' in this sentence cannot be referring to the scientist.\nOption B: A similar answer could be 'he performed some experiments', which describes the same process of 'conducting' the experiements. This also does not seem like the answer.\nOption C: This is a possibility, since the experiment is successful and 'conducted' does not necessarily have to mean 'performed'. It seems reasonable, but this is not the answer to this riddle.\nOption D: This option states that 'he conducted various experiments', and 'he conducted tests', thereby referring to the sentence 'he conducted various experiments' and 'he conducted tests'\nIf the first option is answered correctly, then this option sounds correct and should be marked as the answer. \nHowever, in order to evaluate this option further, we should look at the original sentence again. \nIt is written that 'the scientist conducted many experiments', but this is very different from saying 'the scientist 'conducted various experiments'. 'The scientist conducted many experiments' sounds more like one or more experiments were conducted at the same time while 'the scientist 'performed various experiments' means that several different experiments were performed at different times.  \nIn this sense, 'conduct' and 'perform' in these options are referring to different types of execution and there is no guarantee regarding their accuracy.

A dismayed person isn't uncertain, confused, bewildered or disconcerted.\nAnd the person is certain in his confusion, so options C and D aren't right either.\n\nB, however, does suggest uncertainty, but that isn't quite right either since the author knew all about what the issue was, just how to address it.\nThese are the choices that are closest to the meaning of \"uncertain\".\n\nThe confusion could either be addressed or left alone, but either way, the conclusion from the research is a state of \"defeat.\"\n\nWe aren't seeking the worst state or the highest value of the choices. \"Defeat\" is closest to \"distressed\", so that's the answer.\nAnswer: E. distressed", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": ".\nStep 5: Based on the context of a betting game, \"pool hall\" is the only relevant option, which thus means the place where you are betting with a sharks is a pool hall.\nAnswer: Incorrect! 'Pool Hall' describes any room used for playing pool games with players, it is not necessarily a place of betting. Instead, the correct answer would be 'Pacific Ocean'.\n\n### Reasoning on how to answer it:\n\nThe question asks us to think about the place where we could expect to bet with a shark. Let us know know what kinds of settings and environments it can be. To better understand, let's discuss some scenarios on betting that help us see how the question is relevant:\n1. In the case of a sports betting event, when you participate in the betting, the shark (the skilled player) is usually the one choosing the team or player who will win the game. In essence, in the sports context, the shark is the one placing the bet and the person who places the bet is known as the bookie.\n2. In the case of an online betting event, the shark (a skilled player) is again the one who places the bets. For many internet gaming sites, players can bet by playing themselves and then play against other skilled players. Hence, the context here is also the same as the sports context, and the shark is the same.\n3. In other sports, like golf, tennis, cricket, etc. where the sharks are the professional and well-skilled athletes. If you are planning to bet in these sports then the shark might be anyone who plays well.\n4. From the above contexts and discussions so far, we can thus conclude that if we were playing any kind of game with a skilled player, the kind of place where we could expect such a bet is one where people regularly bet or gamble in a game like a sports arena or a casino.\n5. In general, the term shark indicates a skilled player when it refers to games like pool, where the shark would be a pool game expert. As there is generally a game of pool in a pool hall, the question indirectly asks us to think of such pool hall as the place where we could bet with a shark with the same context of a game like a", "answer": " 21"}

We do not give people money when they ask for something, although sometimes we are unable to refuse a request. (Sentence 1): \n\n2. We do not give money to people when they ask for something.

The food at the restarant was what we expected but the dessert was not sweet enough. (Sentence4):\n\nInput: The food was what we asked for? Choices: \n\nAnswer: C: too sweet.\n\n### Rationales:\nThe sentences are missing two important verbs in the main clause that could be added to strengthen the statements. The answer choices indicate the choice that matches verb(s) that would add more strength to the statements. \n\nSentence 1: The words 'ask' and'refuse' are not sufficient for expressing a strong action. Adding 'to' before 'give' would make the statement strong by showing that this is something that was frequently requested and refused as the question asks, \"We do not give people money.\"\n\nSentence: 2: While 'give' is sufficient, this sentence lacks verb(s) that could express even greater depth in how frequently requests were turned down.\n\nSentence3: Addition of verbs like 'is', 'are', or even 'were' would help express the meaning of the sentence better, thus choice 'C' would represent stronger language.", "answer": " 35"}

Choices: 1. forget - Remember 2. forget - Omit 3. forget - Put aside 4. forget - Slowly recall 5. forget - Take away\nRationales: Let us simplify the question and understand what it is asking. The question is asking in what sense is the answer \"forgot\"? Or in other words what is the meaning of \"forgot\"? We need to understand the meaning of \"frightened\" in the sentence first. Sentence says that \" I did some work on this project with him.\" so, the answer to the sentence will be \"With (He)\" only if the meaning and context of work is understood. \n\nAfter understanding the question we can simplify the answer choices:\n\n\" Forget \" and \"Remember\" are synonyms. There is no context in the question that suggests that we are looking for a synonym of \"forget\".\n\"Omit\" and \"Forget\" also means similar things. It does not make sense to replace an answer we already have with what will essentially be the same type of answer.\n\"Put aside\" is the wrong answer choice if the context of the sentence was \"put aside (He) was a good worker.\" Since then, if he was a good worker then his skill is not lost and can be \"recalled\" in this case so we can pick \"take away\" if the answer is being replaced with any other option and we do not have to worry about the synonym.\n\nIf the meaning of \"Slowly recalled\" is being looked for then this option is the answer.

Choices:  P: buy  A: rent B: rent C: rent  F: pay\nRationales: In this passage, it is clear that \"We can\u2019t afford to ________ any more rent.\" indicates that the speaker is talking about \"paying\" or \"buying.\" \nBecause we know 'paying' is incorrect, that leaves us with a choice between A) and B). In both A) and B), the 'to' is the correct preposition. A preposition is a word that tells where something (ie. another word) is in comparison to another thing or location, and often indicates who or what the other thing is. \nIn this case, however,'rent' is acting as the direct object of the sentence, which would typically use a preposition like 'with'. This results in an incombination between the sentence's structure and the use of 'to'. The words 'with' or 'to' do not necessarily make sense in this context. \nTherefore, A) and B) do not appropriately fill in the blank in this sentence.\n\nSince neither A) or B) appropriately fit, the only answer that would fit the sentence is C) 'pay'.\nAnswer: C): \"We can't _______ any more rent.\"\n\nInput: _________ are known by scientists as \"glow worms.\" Choices:  ION: EELS IION: DEVICES ILIGHT: BUGS\nRationales: ___________ are known by scientists to be the \"glow worm\" is ILIGHT.", "answer": " 18"}

On the other hand, \"A: Keychain\" is already something you're supposed to carry around, and also likely too small to be fitted in a screw driver.\n\nNow we'll move on to identifying the remaining answers. Let's first explore the possibilities around the term \"C : Car\". Cars are made up of various parts that can be fixed by using screwdrivers. If we were talking about cars, then we would use a screwdriver to get rid of the burrs on a car key.\n\nLooking at the remaining options, option B \"Keychain\" seems to be a contender. You can use a screwdriver when you go to fix a watch on a keychain. \n\nAs for options D \"Car Key\" and E \"Parking Meter\", these are still possible solutions. A car key is the smallest key you can have and also one of the things used in cars for various parts and screwdrivers. A parking meter can also be fixed by using such tools, depending on where the burrs are positioned.\n\nHence, given the current context, there are three possible answers, out of which option \"B : Keychain D : Parking Meter\" would work.

It is clear that the student is doing well overall, but is confused about a specific grade.\n\nAnswer choice A: \"first question\" cannot be the correct answer. The answer choice refers to the first question the student did. Therefore, \"first question\" must refer to whether the student answered the question correctly.

However, both of these imply a certain cost.\nThus, an option which does not have a price must be correct.\nThe option which does not contain a price is option C: \"I had to make a choice.\"\nThus, the correct answer is option C.\nAnswer: C. I had to make a decision. \n\nInput: That car is a banger. It's very difficult for it to pass inspections.\nRationales In the first part of the question, we can see that the phrases \"that car\" and \"it's\" refer to a car.\nTherefore, an option which does refer to a car is correct.\nOne of the options which does refer to a vehicle is option A: \"It has only 10,000 miles on it.\"\nThus, this is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A.

B: difficult doesn't make sense for the reason of step 1. However, \"difficult\" could also refer to the difficulty of programming, so it needs further examination. But let's move on.\nStep 3. C: elegant. \"Elegant refers to something as aesthetically pleasing or as something that is well-made or as something very good or very good in a subtle way, especially in performing an office.\nLet's think about the computer's behaviour. It was programmed to behave and perform tasks in a complex way. There is no denying it is as aesthetically appealing as it is the well-made machine with complex functionality and features.\nStep 4.

These are the answers because the scammer was trying to ask people for money online, and the only one he was talking to through the internet was the bank.\nThe reason why the boy scammer is not likely to be in a church (e: bank), city park (a: city park), or hospital (c: hospital) is because people who are likely to give money and are on the internet to donate to a hospital (c:hospital) or a church (e: church), are the majority and the most likely victims of the scammer, while the people who are on the internet to give donations of surgery funds (b: internet) are more likely to be scammers.\nAnswer:  A: city park, B: hospital, C: internet.\n\n### Extra Credit\nA: B: C: D: E: F: G: H: I: J: K: L: M: N: O\n\nInput: Why did the cat", "answer": " 600"}

Choices:  a. They both are considered equipment. b. An appliance refers to a specific type of apparatus. c. An apparatus is a machine built to produce a change. d. The two words have similar meanings and usage. \n\ne. An apparatus is typically more complex than an appliance.\n\nRationale: 1. The words \"apparatus\" and \"appliance\" can be defined in dictionaries.\n   2. Appliance refers to a specific kind of apparatus. It can be more flexible with the meanings. \n   3. Both \"apparatus\" (option A) and \"appliance\" (option B) both can refer to a piece of equipment; however, \"apparatus\" describes a much more complex piece of equipment, whereas \"appliance\" refers rather to a simpler piece of equipment. \n   4. \"An apparatus is typically more complicated than an appliance. (option C)\", we can infer an additional answer from the question itself. \n   5. \"They both are considered equipment.

'Something' implies that it may be a lot of things to cook, since it seems to be unspecified.\nStep 3 and 4: As answered in the previous question, chefs are often known as the best cooks who specialize in cooking dishes.\nStep 5 and 6: Looking at the answer choices A: boiling, B: baking C; roasting D: Frying and E: roast roasted, we can eliminate B, E\nStep 7 and 8: The remaining choices - A, C and D - only refer to cooking methods using hot air.\nStep 9: Looking at the options, A and C both mean cooking in hot oil.

Choices: 1 B: Kilogram 2 Scoop 0.5 litre 3 100 kg 4 50 kg\nRationales: This is a question to test your knowledge of the English language and its terminology.\n\n1. The most widely used unit of measurement for weight in scientific context is the \"kg\" or kilogram.\n2. Although there are other units of measurement in existence, the \"kg\" is the default unit used by most people and contexts.\n3. One way in which this context clues you in about the answer is that there is a'metric unit' in the question, because an 'English unit' would most likely contain information about weight with respect to pounds rather than the decimal equivalent of \"kg\".\n4. The other clue is the word \"quintal\", which sounds foreign to most speakers of English.\n5. Additionally, the question explicitly states 'what is a \"quintal\"' - there really isn't a need to find what a \"quintal of something\" is when the question is specifically asking for the definition for a unit of measurement. This further indicates the unit is of a metric nature which is usually referred to by its unit of measurement, e.g. kg.\n6. However, if you look at the definitions provided for each option, you will notice there are a few that seem plausible for the context of the question, e.g. the scoop and the container that holds 50kg.\n7.

Choices:  A.yes B. no C. yes D. yes E.no\nRationales:The question is about asking the boss for one day of time off by answering a set of questions with \"yes\". \n\nTo answer the question, let's understand the rationale behind the boss' requirement:\n\nThis implies that the boss is eager to please anyone who can answer a set of questions with yes.\n\nTo answer the questions, let's understand how to choose between different answer choices:\n\nThese are the relevant answers listed in the options:\n\nIf this boss is very eager to please and was willing to give an employee who could answer any of the questions a one day off, then it's most likely this boss doesn't check the accuracy of the yes/no answer (as no one would need a boss who cares). Also, by looking at the questions, it's easy to observe that no logical answer requires any logical answers to get a no.\n\nAnd we get the following conclusion:\n\nThus, anyone can give a yes to each of them and the boss would give anyone a one day off.\n\nThe only option available that contradicts this statement is A: \"no\", which does not fit the boss' requirement.\n\nHence, \"yes\" answers are the only available options.\n\nHowever, there can be other people or scenarios that can also contradict this boss' requirement.

The manager didn't specify the date of delivery, which suggests that they would arrive the next DA.\n3. The manager said the products would ARRIVE, not LEAVE or DEPART.\n4. \"The next\" always refers to the day after the current day.

Option A: It's impossible to say if the manager is referring to the next day or the week after next day, so this doesn't fit.\n8.

Choices: A: back yard B: couch C: garage D: yard E: graveyard\nRationales: This question is asking what type of location cemeteries are typically found in. \n\nSince the choice should identify a location where something is mostly found, and the options identify different kinds of specific locations, A, B, and E are not good choices because they refer to the inside of a location, not the location itself. \n\nC is an ambiguous choice. It says a \"garage\", implying a general location with a structure, instead of a cemetery, which would require a field for burial. It is not explicitly said if the garage in question is a typical garage or a specialized garage like ones used for car storage with garage doors. \n\nD is ambiguous as well since we don't know if the term \"yard\" refers to common garden variety yard, or if it is referring an area like a field or a farm. Unless the writer explicitly specified otherwise, the term \"yard\" could take one of these two meanings. \n\nTherefore, the remaining choice is E, 'graveyard' since it is the only one that most clearly describes a location where cemeteries are commonly found. \n\nAnswer: Only \"graveyard\"\n\n### Instructions: In the next paragraph, the author describes the main events that take place in the first act of a play.

Thus, to maintain coherence in the structure of their sentences, the right phrase would be something similar to 'with joy'.\nStep 3: Amongst the options available, 'with joy' would be the right answer as the phrase 'with fear' and the phrases used for ire both appear earlier in the question.\nAnswer: D) with joy", "answer": " 2"}

Choices:  A. Mathematics B. Engineering C. Computer Science D. English E. Fine Arts\nRationales: Let's parse the question and look at the different phrases: \"if he were able\", \"with which subjects he would teach\" and \"he gave out\". \n1. \"If he were able\" means that the student is making a promise now which he might not achieve later.\n2. \"With which subjects he would teach \" indicates we first need to know the teacher's ability and background before determining the subject matter he offers.\n3. \"He gave out\" implies that the distribution of papers is associated with some kind of announcement about the student's skills and the subjects he will teach.\n4. From this, we can determine that there must be some additional information about what the student is planning to teach.\n5. We are left with four possible options but none clearly stand out as an appropriate response for the question.\n\n6. However, if we interpret \"giving out papers\" as an announcement, then each paper could contain the subject he is planning to teach. \n7.

To do that, we would need to determine which way the phrases is used in the expression to begin with.\nStep 6: 'Betting with a shark' is used here as a metaphor for playing a game with an expert player or professional gambler. Thus, it uses the term'shark' as a synonym for an expert player or winner.\nStep 7: From this, one can conclude that the answer is most likely C: south pacific. \nStep 8: This is because the South Pacific is known to have a high amount of professional gamblers with expertise or luck in the game of pool.\nStep 9: This means that South Pacific is likely to be the place where the game of pool with a shark is taking place, and not the location where the fish is being housed.\nStep 10: And thus, the answer is C: SPICY!\n\n\n### Input: \nThe teacher was very good she inspired me and was very ___. \n\n### Demostration:\nInput: I had a professor and she was great!

Choices:  V: library B: bedroom C: park D: house E: classroom\nRationales: Let's start with the most likely answer: the book was being studied in a classroom. Books are mostly used to study a class, and this answer matches the clue, as studying typically happens in classrooms. \nSecondly, looking at the list of options, a classroom is not a location that one typically reads with. Reading is something that is associated with places where people relax and have some free time, and there are various locations that could be considered, such as the library, house, park and bedroom.\nThirdly, we can assume that \"read with great intent\" means that there was a strong interest in reading the book. By process of elimination, this indicates that the place where the person read would have had a strong influence over their desire to read, as their interest increased because of the environment.\nFourthly, the house and the park don't exactly correspond to what one does in these places, and so they can be eliminated. \nFurthermore, the bedroom and library are more places where someone would read if it was their intention to engage in a reading activity, as they are calm and somewhat private spaces, and these places would match the environment described through the clue, as the environment impacted one's desire to read.\nIn comparing the bedroom and the library, the library may seem like the obvious answer. However, the clue suggests that the location where a book is studied impacts a person's desire to read, and hence the bedroom becomes a more likely option, as it is a space where people read a lot of non-academic books.\nIn conclusion, a person was likely to read the book in their bedroom, as it is the environment that influenced their desire to do so.", "answer": " 350"}

We know that 12 inches is 1 foot, so 30.4 = 30. 4 cm. Hence a lighting strike in 1 foot is 30.4 cm away.\n* \"Km\": Kilometer is a unit of distance that describes the length of the ground. It is used to tell us how far away a location is from a bigger location, so 1 Km = 0.25 mi.

The answer must start with a capital letter.\n\n1. A borrowing (B) is when one owner (the boy) gives it temporarily to another (the stylist).\n2. A loan (C) is when someone is not returning it, just renting it out.\n3. A renting (D) is very similar to a loan, except it ends in \"ing\" and is permanent.\n4. A leasing (E) is almost never used in reference to people hats. \"Lease\" is when one party (the boy) rents a hat from someone else (the stylist) and returns it.\n5.

It's more associated with an actual ocean.\nStep 7: Similarly,'mediterranean' or'south pacific', whilst having names similar to places to play, are not likely locations to play with a shark. They are more likely to be destinations in a game or a bet.\nStep 8: Finally, 'pool hall' is not likely a place as we have already established this doesn't fit with the word 'betting'. In addition, we can eliminate it because this option isn't associated with playing an actual game but rather with pool halls where the game is played.\nStep 9: Hence, the only remaining option is 'pool hall', which is most likely associated with sharks given'shark' is used in the context of betting and winning.

Choices: A. poor results B. good results C. positive results D. a variety of results E. bad results\nRationales: In the context of the sentence that asks about the results of a fishing expedition, 'good', 'bad', and 'poor' will all be understood as a positive or negative evaluation of the results. Therefore, if we discard these options, to find the correct answer, we should select an option that does not convey a particular result or quality.\nStep 1: Choic \"A. poor results\" fits both categories we are trying to avoid.\nStep 2. Likewise, \"B. good results\" can refer to good outcomes, or good in general, and is not specific to the sentence. Thus, these options should be discarded.\nStep 3. Moving on to \"C. positive results\", this option is also potentially ambiguous in meaning. It connotes an interpretation of results that are generally positive, which we want to avoid.\nStep4. So we should choose something that does not communicate an evaluation or quality of results. Looking at choice D: \"A variety of results,\" it implies that different things are outcomes. This fits with the context that we are aiming to stay away from.\nStep 5.

To live means to stay in a particular place and work, study, and rest there. You do these things at an office, not there.\nChoice B is incorrect because looking for a place to live on the street is not a good idea, especially for a woman who is alone or in a city where it is not safe to walk around.\nChoice C is incorrect because a restaurant is not the best place to find a room for rent. It may be possible that the room is available for a short time or that it may not be clean, or there may not be many opportunities to cook a meal there.\nChoice D is incorrect because being close to a school is not a good plan, especially if it is a woman's college and she may have a problem living with the students.\nChoice E is incorrect because living inside a hospital is not a good idea because the surroundings are not comfortable and the rules are strict.\n\nAn answer to this question could be: Choice B: On the street.\nSince living in an office, restaurant, or next to a woman's college would be unlikely, we are left with B and E.\n\nIt seems like the best choice for the answer is the one that seems to match the context most closely. In this case, walking the streets could provide greater opportunity for finding a desired room to rent than living in or near a hospital.\n\nFurthermore, a person \"out on the street\" is more vulnerable to being hit by a car, so if the person were a woman, this would not be the best idea.\n\nAnswer: 2.

We must think of sounds which are commonly associated with a rave party. It can be seen that \"Raving fans\" does not mention a sound at all.\nStep 3. 3. Therefore, we can eliminate \"B. Raving fans\" from consideration.\nStep 4. 4. \"Banging music\" is probably music which makes a lot of noise (loud music), but that is not specific to a particular rave party.\nSimilarly, \"Chanting\" is a type of sound which can be heard at a rave party, but since it is not specific to raves, it can be eliminated as well. Hence, we can rule out both \"A. Banging music\" and \"B. Chanting\" as possible answers to the question.\nStep 5. 5. \"Thumping booms\" is a generic term which refers to loud noises. Hence, it does not mention a specific sound unique to raves.\nStep 6. 6.

Such noises could definitely be found at a raven but are not exclusive to raves.\nNow, if we consider the question again, we will find that the phrase \"thumping booms\" does not sound natural.

Out of the choice, options D and E contain \"marsh.\" Marsh is a type of land located near a large body of water. It\u2019s swampy and usually quite muddy.\n    3.

Choices:  a) destroy b) split c) smash d) fragment e) burst f) shred\nRationales: We're looking for the word that is the best fit for \"destroy\".\n1. Looking at the options:\n2. \"A\", \"C\", and \"E\" would not be appropriate responses because they all contain words that can refer to breaking something, but have a different connotation to the idea of \"destroying\" someone or something.\n3. \"F\" is an answer only if \"shatter\" referred to an object being destroyed/smashed/split/etc., rather than an individual being destroyed.\n4. \"D\" and \"B\" may refer to breaking something into smaller pieces, but they do not have the connotation of the person/object being destroyed.\n5.

In contrast, while an anatomy chart may be used as a part of the reviewing process, it's not likely to be an important part of the testing process.\n\nOption B online resources may be used to learn more about biology, but are not necessary because the content would not be tested in the test itself.\n\nB Option C an anatomy chart is not necessary, it's just a supplement.\n\nD Option E \" she did not sleep\" is not relevant for studying/reviewing for a biology test.\n\nAnswer: B: on line resources\n\nInput: A boy's mother told him he is gifted and could get a scholarship.

Choices: A: at a party B: with a treasure search C: at dinner D: at the store E: in a bowl\nRationales: This question is asking us to identify the method by which the pearl was found.\n\nThere are several considerations we need to take note of in order to find the correct answer. \n\n1. If the pearl was \"found at a party\", there are some reasons that make it unlikely.\n  a. There aren't a lot of times when you are likely searching for a pearl in a party. There are more likely scenarios such as shopping at a store, treasure hunting, or dinner.\n  b. An appropriate context of searching for a pearls would be \"found with a treasure search\", not \"found at a party\".\n2. Although one may find a pearl in food, this does not fit with the specific question.\n3. \"Found at a store\" is not the same as \"found at dinner.\" \n4. \"Found in a bowl\" seems like a more appropriate context in which to find a pearl, since it's a container that food is served in.\n5. Finally, the wording \"at dinner\" does not make sense since it implies searching for a pear from something served in a bowl rather than pearls themselves. \n6. Comparing this to all the other answers, the correct answer is E: found in a bowl. \nAnswer: E: found in a [bowl]\n\nInput: The doctor had never removed a __________ eye.

Running can also be done on a beach but this is more of a cardio exercise while there are other places a person can run.\nStep 3. Tennis and swimming have a lot of court or water required.\nStep 4. Volleyball can be played but the nets might not be ideal for it.\nStep 5. Since this option does not restrict the sport to any particular time of day or certain skill levels, only 1 of the 5 options meets the criteria.\nStep 6.

Both feed on live prey.\n\nBoth are carnivores and feed on live prey, however, this is very uncommon. It's rare for sharks and snakes to feed on the same food, let alone use the same technique to do so. This leaves D.

Choices: 1: anger, 2: sadness, 3: relief, 4: anger, 5: disappointment\nRationales: Let's follow a simple process to answer the question.\n\n1. Firstly, we need to analyze the various words used in the sentence. We need to pay special attention to the word 'betrays'. \n\nWhen we 'betray' someone, we do something that makes our behavior a breach of trust.\n\nThese betrayals could be in different ways, and we do them consciously/unconsciously. \n\nNow, our main question is that if a group of people trust someone, then how will they react once they know they were betrayed?\n\n2. To answer this properly, we need to think about the people involved, such as 'group of people'.\n\nA group has many people, each with a different personality, mindset, background, beliefs, perspectives, etc. \n\nSo, let us think how will 'group of people' react to that betrayal.\n\n3. Next, we need to consider and identify the possible'reactions' of a 'group of people'. \n\n'Reactions' refer to how the group responds to a person's betrayal of the trust.\n\nThe various'reactions' of people could consist of negative sentiments (anger, sadness, disappointment), as well as positive sentiments (relief or happiness).\n\n4. Finally, we need to compare the various sentiments and select a suitable'reason' for how a 'group of people' is 'likely to react' to the betrayal of trust.\n\nLet's start with 'anger'.

For this reason, we can\u2019t use the opposite of any phrase, and instead must use a single word.\n4. The phrases \u2018fighter pilot: and \u2018nurse: are not antonyms, which means that they cannot be opposites, and so they are incorrect answer choices.\n5.

Choices:  a) short  b) round c) muscular d) thin  e) taller\nRationales: In order to solve this question, we first define the meaning of 'long ago'. Then, we determine the options for what these people could be like.\nAs people who live in Africa are the same ones who lived in Africa long before, these people can therefore be described as short, round, muscular, thin, or taller based on their current physical appearance.\n- People who lived in Africa were short. Because tall people can still live in Africa today.\n- People who are short could be short based on their weight, height, or bone growth. However, this question doesn't specify that. Because the question can be answered without the need to interpret the meaning of the word.\n- People who live in Africa today can be described as short in every one of the listed options below. Because there are plenty of short people now.\nTherefore, the statement below: People who lived in Africa long time ago were short because taller people don't grow in Africa anymore.\n- People who grew in Africa long time ago could be short, tall, round or muscular.\n- Round can be interpreted in many different ways. Because not all people who live in Africa have a round figure.\n- Round in this case could mean plump, not short. So it doesn't make sense. Because no one can be both short and plump.\n- Muscular can mean tall. Because when people are muscular it is often due to their large bodies.\n- Thin could mean short. Because when people are thin it is due to a lack of weight.\n- Muscular could mean short. Because short people can be strong and muscular.\n- Taller people don't live in Africa anymore.

However, 'pool' is a term normally used to refer to the game.\nStep 7: Hence, the answer is B.\nRationales:\nStep 1: The question asks to identify the type of shady character that person might be talking about.\nStep 2. The first thought that comes to mind is to think of a character that is not well-meaning or honest.\nStep 3. The term'shady' is commonly used to describe such a character.\nStep 4. Among the answer choices,'mugger' has nothing directly referring to someone shady or untrustworthy, but people might tend to assume so.\nStep 5. For the other options, only 'gangster' can fit.\nStep 6. Considering the general context of a question, most readers would tend to pick 'gangster' over the choice of 'hustler' because 'hustler' is a term that specifically refers to a con artist, while 'gangster' could refer to criminal activities other than conning people.\nStep 7. 'Hangman' is irrelevant, and the choice of'scammer' sounds too recent, given the current context.\nStep 8.

A person could get their foot caught in a woodland because the ground is slippery, as they could fall or lose their footing. This answer is incorrect, as the wording of the question doesn't support that being the reason.\n2. The woodland could be too muddy causing a foot being stuck. This answer is incorrect too, as the wording still doesn't support it. The ground could be muddy from rain, but does the woodland have to be abandoned in order to be muddy? No, it doesn't. Hence, the answer is still incorrect.\n3. The foot could also get caught when there are lots of rocks/boulders in an area. This has a good chance of getting the foot stuck, but this option is wrong too because the type of a woodland could be very different. It could be an alpine forest with lots of boulders on ground.\n4. The woodland could also be overgrown and the sticks, twigs, small trees intertwined with each other, or roots can cause some discomfort for walking, ultimately leading to getting the footstuck. This answer is correct.\n5. The woodland could have uncovered/uncultivated, old and/or abandoned areas and the foot might get stuck.

They should go in order from least likely to most likely.\nStep 1: The question tells us that it's less likely that it will be found in an aquarium since an aquarium isn't a place for soap.\nStep 2. Similarly, the mediterranean sea is not a place where most people wash their dishes, although they might be in the middle of the sea.\nStep 3. Even less likely is finding soap in the south pacific because it's very rare to see people washing dishes in that region either.\nStep 4. Then, the next most likely place to find soap is in a pool hall. Although it's uncommon for people to find soap in a pool hall, it's also unlikely for people to eat while swimming in the mediterranean ocean.\nStep 5.

It refers to the amount of salt required for a city, which is the appropriate quantity of salt for the needs of a large metropolis or district.\n2. A: large tub is too large to be transported, hence not feasible.\n3. C: large truckload is too much and requires large amount of fuel to transport and store, thus not reasonable.\n4. B: several tablespoons is too insignificant and does not scale to the level of supply required by the entire city.\n5. E: large cup is more than the requirement since a city doesn't consume its entire salt stock at once, so an empty cup can't be used in the context of the question here.\n6.

The bag is always kept in the closet, thus, the other options wouldn't fit perfectly in the context. All of the answers below don't reflect a specific home or living space, while also referring to where the question asks: \"Where is your baggage?\"\n\n######Explanation:\n\n\n\n1. A: back: Our bag is the literal weight of our bodies, so \"back\" would be incorrect.\n2. B: car: Our bag can't be kept in a car because the space in a car is not enough to properly secure our bags, thus, the answer is not B.\n3.

Choices: \tA: apartment building B: office C: refrigerator D: kitchen E: street\nRationales:\tStep 1: The question asks where you would find a mango.\nStep 2. The context suggests this is occurring during summer so is related to buying fruits or vegetables outdoors at a farmers market.\nStep 3. We need a place where you are likely to find mangoes. \nStep 4. To begin, we can easily eliminate choice D: kitchen, as mangoes are not commonly used in the kitchen, given their delicate and sour nature. \nStep 5. Mangoes are commonly consumed in fruit salads, in smoothies, or as fresh fruit with or without any additional ingredients like milk or yogurt. \nStep 6. Based on this, choice C: refrigerators don't fit well. Most often, mangoes are eaten fresh from a store, not stored in a refrigerators.\nStep 7. Now we are left with 3 answers, choice A: apartment building, B: office and E: street. \nStep 8. Apartment buildings, offices and streets all have similar properties and are relatively common, and each of them would have a chance of having mangoes available for sale. \nStep 9.

Choices: 1. A: bus 2. B: train 3. C: car park 4. D: train platform 5. E: ticket office\nRationales: While searching for lost belongings at bus depots, we expect to find the belongings in the location that make sense.\n1. 'Bus' means vehicle and 'depot' means to depict a point of station which is usually stationary.\n2. 'Train' is a form of stationary public transportation vehicle and 'platform' is usually in a railway station.\n3. 'Car park' and 'train platform' have similar meaning as 'bus depot' in that they both are stationary points with vehicles parked them. 'Car park', however, has the literal association with public vehicles, so it is more likely that 'car park' might have been used intentionally. \n4. 'Ticket office' and 'bus depot', have the same meaning as places for ticket inquiries, so we can use elimination to eliminate 'ticket office' from the answer.\n5. 'Bus depot' is used in the sentence and 'depot' is a word that can also refer to a point where passengers get on and off, so we can combine this with the previously discussed information to be 'bus depot' as the correct answer.\nAnswer: D-Bus Depot\n\nInput: If a dog was the person in charge of a household, what would be the result?

We can categorize the words based on two criteria: \n3. First criterion - where a long trip can be expected/found:\na. Adventure is a word for a long trip on the adventuresome.\nb. Wilderness is a word for a trip found among the untamed wilderness\nc. Escape is a word for a journey to escape a difficult situation.\nd. Mission is a word for a very structured and premeditated trip\ne. Story is a word for a fictitious (untrue) trip in books.\n4. Second criterion - the type of trip it indicates about a place or person:\na. Adventuresome is an epitome for a specific kind of place or person\nb. Wilderless is a place where no people live. It\u2019s not good as an epitome for anywhere\nc. Escape suggests there must be something being escaped from or to. This word isn\u2019t suitable for being the epitome for any place\nd.

The word'ship' can be construed as either a verb (to ship) or a noun (a large boat). \n2. The question asks about the location of the first ship. Thus, we need to pick the best option to convey where it might have been built. \n3. The verb'ship' can mean transport by a ship. Given this, it is highly unlikely that the first ship was transported. This excludes choices A and B.\n4. Hence, consider choice C - sea. The word sea here cannot mean 'the sea', but instead the deep water of oceans.\n5. Choices D and E are excluded from the context of building a first ship. Water and coast do not refer to the ocean where building a ship takes place, but instead water that is used to clean/maintain things or the land bordering the sea.\n6.

Since you will not be going abroad, apartment is an incorrect answer.\nStep 3. \"Street\" may indicate where you'll be waiting for the company, but it does not align with the information mentioned in the prompt. So, \"street\" is removed.\nStep 4. As we are eliminating answer choices, the probability that \"work\" is the best answer is high.

This metaphor tells us what the ice cube and the person have in common: \n\n1. Choice 1A: Heat indicates the temperature and the presence of energy that causes an object to change its state. \n2. It cannot be used as an answer as it does not specifically refer to what an ice cube can and cannot melt from. \n3. Choice 1B: Water is an incorrect answer only because ice cubes melt slowly due to the presence of H2O within their structure. \n4.

Therefore, 'who' is the one betting in this example?\nStep 7: For it to make sense, we should assume that 'you' betting is the same as 'a player'. So, the sentence becomes:\n\nIf 'a player' is betting\nwith a fish,\nwhere are they likely playing?\nStep: 8: 'With a fish' is redundant in the question, as the context gives us the meaning of 'fish'.

Given the options, we need to choose the one that is most likely to parallel the student's feeling after a period of study.\n4. 'exhausted' and 'confused' are both possible choices, but they don't match the sentence's context of the student being quite after hours of study. These feelings may be experienced after a long period of exertion.\n5.\n6. 'Confused' is a plausible response by itself, as long as it is combined with another option.\n7.\n8.

Choices: 1 A: rugby 2 B: cricket 3 C: football 4 D: soccer 5 E: tennis\nRationales: Let's see what the clue gives us. The question asks us in which country rugby is considered to be more popular. The question mark makes us consider both rugby and cricket as possible answers. The key here is to look for differences between rugby and the other options.\n1. To start with, rugby is a team game whereas cricket requires a single player to be on the field. To make it even simpler, rugby is a team sport whereas cricket is an individual sport.\n2. Second, cricket is the sport that is being played in a stadium. Cricket players use cricket bats, whereas rugby players use rugby boots.\n3. Third, the word \"Soccer\" comes from \"association football\". This game of football (or soccer) is played all over Australia.\n4. Football (soccer) is in general played on some kind of grassy field, and the term \"football\" is used in Australia to refer to soccer. But this is NOT true for rugby.\n5. Now, finally, we can compare rugby to football (soccer) as well as cricket.\n6. Both rugby and football are team sports, but football is played on a bigger field and rugby has 15 players on the field. Football players use football boots and rugby players use their actual boots.\n7. So, now we'll pick one of the options that doesn't match any of the clues above.\n8.

Choices:  A angle B: hypotenuse C: height of triangle D: side E: shortest side F: median\nRationales: Given the question, we have the following hypothesis:\n```\n\nAssuming that the side lengths of the triangle are 3, 5 and 7, the side length is unknown because there is no side length other than 5 and 7\n```\n\nHypothesis is formed by the given facts:\n\nThe triangle is A = 3, b = 5, c = 7 and the side length is unknown.\n\nTherefore, to prove the hypothesis we need the unknown side length as the dependent variable.\n\nWe have to use\n(side) = square root (b. c / a) ------------------------------(1)\n\nand\n\n(sin A) = b. c / a -------------------------------------------------------------(2)\n\nFor finding the unknown side length we use hypothesis and form the relationship between the unknown and dependent variables as follows:\n\nb. c / a = sin (A)---------> c = sin (A). b / a\n\n(side) = sqrt [sin (A). b / cos (A). a]-------------------> (d) = \u221a[ sin (A). b ]\n\nSolving, we get c = d. Since, c is the dependent variable, (d) is the independent variable.\n\nHence, based on the question given, the answer options should only include the side, length, unknown as the dependent variable. \n\nThe answer choices that satisfy this criteria is the following\n```\n\nmedian - 7\nside length - 5\n```\n\nHence, C = Median, E = Side length because all other variables mentioned in the answers are not dependent variables.\nAnswer: C Median \n\nInput: She was making pizza bread dough.

The question is describing a famous violinist's sentiment towards her profession, so it will require one of the five senses.\n2. The options are words used to explain when the violinist was playing, but this is not the answer she is looking for.\n3. 'Uninterrupted' means when she is not interrupted, but is playing.\n4. Similarly, 'detached' means that when she is detached, she is still playing.\n5. 'Distracted' means a lack of concentration.\n6. 'Interrupted' means \"to make unable to continue or proceed.\"\n7.

Although these words also mean a long set of stairs, this is not the context that we are in, as the prompt specifies that we are asking about structures typically used to travel from one floor to another or to a roof.\n\nFurthermore, we should also note that since the words \u201ca staircase\u201d and \u201ca corridor\u201d are both noun and stand-alone sentences without any definite or indefinite articles, it is safe to assume that either one of these nouns should be used by itself as their own word.\n\nConsidering this further, we can conclude that if a corridor can be used to replace \u201ca staircase,\u201d then we can conclude that \u201ca corridor and \u201ca staircase\" are similar in some sense.\n\nTherefore, we can try testing each statement against each answer choice by substituting \u201ca corridor\" into the blank and finding in which answer the phrase does not make sense or does not fit the context.\n\nFurthmore, after each elimination, we can add notes on the page", "answer": " 16"}

The choices were, \"spacious display\", \"wide open section\", \"large showcase\", \"neat arrangement\", and \"large store\".\n4. The use of the word \"spacious\" suggests a large and \"showcase\" describes the front part of the store, so we can eliminate \"showcase\" because the other choices have not been eliminated.\n5. The choice \"wide open section\" is not an accurate description of the space and should be eliminated.\n6. The other choice \"neat arrangement\" was not clear, but it could be referring to \"spacious\" in that it did not provide enough information, so that too should be eliminated. \n7. Thus, in the original choice, the word \"spacial\" was eliminated and the phrase \"wide open section\" was also eliminated, leaving \"large display\" as the only remaining option.\n8.

But the word'shark' is always associated to the ocean, which is not where such a situation is likely to happen, as games like billiards or pool are not usually played in aquariums. Moreover, 'aquarium' could refer to the location of where such sea creatures are displayed, not where they may be playing pool. Hence, this option is eliminated.\nStep 10: Option B:'mediterranean' means 'of the Mediterranean Sea', hence referring to that region. However, considering the context and the options it is unlikely to be associated with a game of pool. Thus, this option gets eliminated.\nStep11: Option C:'south pacific', similarly to the mediterranean, has specific geographical connotations, and does not match the context at all. Moreover, it refers to a specific region of the earth that is not likely to be a betting location, and therefore is not the answer to the question.\nStep 12: Option D: 'pacific ocean'. This option seems to fit the question as it refers to a location where people are known to often bet. However, let's look at whether it specifically refers to poker. Considering that 'pacific ocean,' is a very general term referring to an entire body of water, it is not enough that 'pool' makes sense, as it still needs to fit with the context.\nStep 13: Upon considering option E, 'pool hall,' though initially seems like it might refer to billiards or pool games, it actually only refers to the game itself, not to where it is played.

Option C does not make sense either, considering the area is large and not in the form of a pond.\n4. Option D does not make sense considering the size of the area.

The question asks the reader to decide which place it would be unusual for a train to be. \n2: Let's look at the answer choices one by one and identify the answers that meet this criterion.\n3. The train is described as usually being on the tracks, so any place that describes tracks, such as C) tracks or A) railway, as the answer fits this description.\n4. Answer B) rails refers to the tracks on which trains run, but it's not atypical for the train to be on the tracks.\n5. Similarly, answer D) aisle does not indicate this answer choice usually hosts trains, since they are usually located on actual tracks instead of aisles.\n6. Answer A) railway would be more likely to meet the stipulated criteria, although other options are certainly possible, including tracks.\n7. It's important to note that these answer choices meet the basic requirement of this question but none of them explicitly state a place where trains are usually found.\n8.

Choices:  B: Great white C: Bull shark D: Hammerhead E: Megalodon\nRationales: Here the question talks about a shark in a tank.\n1. The question asked for the type of shark that would most likely enter a shark tank.\n2. This implies that it should be one that has the propensity or tendency to enter tanks.\n3. We can eliminate option B, Great White, as it is not the type of shark who would be apt to enter a shark or fish tank. It is a large aquatic predator belonging to the Carcharinus genus within the family Scyliorhinidae.\n4. Option C, Bull shark is also incorrect answer as it refers to the genus Carcharhinus, which does not mean that it lives in tanks.\n5.

Choices: A: try B: make an effort C: get out of bed D: try to E: do their best\nRationales: When we 'try', we act in an effort to complete a goal.  If we 'try' to'make a mistake', it implies we're intending to make a mistake from the beginning.\n\nTo answer, it is important to distinguish what it means to 'try'.  There are several possible meanings for this word given context. In the context of this question, it implies a conscious effort to accomplish something.\n\nLet's analyze the choices individually:\n\n1)  Choice B: Option B does not apply because it doesn't make sense to say that in order to'make a mistake', we have to 'get out of bed'.\n\n2)  Choice C: Option C also doesn't make sense because if we 'get out of bed', we're not trying to make a mistake.\n\n3)  Choice D: Option D can be eliminated on the basis of the same reason as choice B. Option D is vague because it is not precise enough and can be interpreted as saying we have to \"try their best\".\n\n4)  Choice A: \"Try\" here can be interpreted as making an effort to do something, or performing an activity that has the intention of achieving a goal.\n\n5)  Choice E: \"to do\" here also means the same as \"trying\": acting in an effort to reach a goal or objective.\n\nFrom the options that remain, it is clear that A and E both have a similar meaning. Hence, when selecting one, we can pick the one which is used more frequently in standard English.  \n\nSince the context is not clear, we can't discount that it has a more specific meaning here.

And secondly, the woodshop is where the wooden material is used for the construction.

The context of the question clearly is about describing food that is already rotten, so this doesn't fit the context.\nStep 2. Looking at the remaining options,'spoiled','spoilt', and 'damaged' are likely correct choices, as all of them describe food that has gone bad.\nStep 3. We then have to determine the correct choice - spoiled or spoilt. The answer choice that has a 'y' in the middle indicates the correct choice.\nStep 4. Looking at the options together, we can see that'spoilt' is written with an 'l' in the middle, while'spoiled' is written with an's'. Thus, choosing'spoilt' indicates that the correct answer is this option.\nAnswer: B spoilt\n\nInput: You can't have dessert first, why do you think it's a good idea then?

Choices:  A : defect B: perforation C: tire rubber D: hole E: deflation\nRationales: This is the type of grammar question.

In the example given, \u201cgap\u201d would make little to no sense.\n3. The answer must also fit in with the description that is given (ie. If \u201cdeflation\u201d were to be the answer, it would not fit in with the description at all since \u201cdeflection\u201d is defined as \u201cthe action or process of causing something to move away from a particular direction\u201d)\n4. \u201cPerforation\u201d, \u201cdefect\u201d, \u201ctire rubber\u201d, and \u201cdeflation\u201d are all synonyms for \u201chole\u201d.\n5. \u201ctire rubber\u201d is incorrect since the word \u201crubber\u201d is being used to describe the tire but the definition of \u201crubber\u201d clearly states that the word \u201crubbe\u201d must mean tire.\n6. \u201cdefect\u201d is incorrect since the definition of \u201cdefile\u201d is opposite of what we are looking for in the question. If \u201cdefile\u201d meant \u201ca hole\u201d then the definition of an \u201cincomplete tire\u201d would also mean \u201ca hole\u201d.\n7. \u201cperforation\u201d is incorrect since the same problem that we had with \u201cdefect\u201d applies to \u201cperforation\u201d.\n8. \u201cdeflation\u201d is incorrect since it means \u201cthe action or process by which something (such as the surface area of a large body of water) becomes flat, flatter, or flattest ; reduce in volume\u201d; again, no sense if used with \u201cbreaks a tire\u201d.\n9.

City Center: a city center could include a busy road, but it would not make much sense or be an appropriate answer to the question (i.e. to \"find\" something in a city center), it is more of an out of context answer.\nD. Highway: a highway is commonly used to move a vehicle down the road, and thus, \"D: highway\" is the correct response as it makes the most sense and aligns with the intent of the question.\nE.

Choices: 1. Yes, it's a great idea. You'll be more relaxed and it won't affect your flying skills. 2. No, alcohol isn't good for your body. It can sometimes cause dehydration, which is bad for airplane cabins. 3. No, drinking isn't recommended. Alcohol is a depressant, and will make you tired on the plane. Besides, alcohol is sometimes banned on flights, so you wouldn't want to make an illegal purchase. 4. No, it's not a great idea. Alcohol can cause nausea on a plane, as well as headaches and fatigue. Besides, if you have to take a painkiller or a medical professional while on the plane, the medics will have a hard time knowing what the dose is. 5. Yes, it'll help you relax. You'll only be on the plane for a few hours, and so it won't make any difference.\n\nRationales:\n1 & 2: These both agree that drinking alcohol before the flight isn\u2019t a good idea; so they\u2019re out.\n3 & 5: They both say drinking isn\u2019t recommended; so take a look at 4.\n4: It\u2019s not helpful because it\u2019s ambiguous.

Therefore, these are not possible answers.\nStep 4 : If the games was too difficult, why would the young man say \"I can't play anymore\" afterwards?\nStep 5 : He'd have to say \"I'm not able to play anymore\" then.\nStep 6 : The answer is C: the boy was injured.\nStep 7 : The young man lost at the games the first time he played.\nStep 8 : The last sentence says \"After winning the second game, he was no longer able to play because there were no more stars left in the sky.\"\nStep 9 : If the games were so difficult, this boy would have no chance to win.\nStep 10 : A young man who is no longer able to play games is \"injured\" and this is the correct answer.\nStep 11 : Choice D: \"the games were very difficult\" is also incorrect because he won the second game and he was able to play games again afterwards.\nStep 12 : The answer is B: 'the boy was injured at the Games'.\nStep 13 : The answer is B.

Choices: 1. Wait until they want to do it again. 2. Ask for help. 3. Make a change in their surroundings. 4.

Option E: a pool fiberglass fi is incorrect. Option E does not use the plural version of fiberglass. The answer would be (a) swimming pool. 1. The context is the choice of words in the question. 2. The question describes an \"old fish tank,\" and we are asked what it was made out of. 3. The choices are:  * made of water = A  * built into the wall = B  * in the fishbowl = C  * a swimming pool fiber fiber = E 4. Out of these four, only C is a noun, and only C is referring to something old. 5.

Also, C: built into the walls could technically be made of old material if the walls were old. 7. We could potentially be able to choose from only A and C. 8. This choice is still incorrect, because the words used only apply to old material, while the fish tank cannot have been made from old matter. 9.

Pear and Orange are fruits, but do not align with the phrase \"what did he received,\" as they would be something he was given or given to him.\n2. Apple is a fruit also. However, the \"lunchbox\" does not help to clarify anything about the boy's experience since it could either refer to the lunch box as a container or a box to store the box. Since this is unclear, it is impossible to correctly predict the answer and, therefore, is not a possible choice.\n3. \"Apple\" is a fruit. However, this answer and the phrase \"What did he receive\" do not make sense together.\n4. The lunchbox/box/apple option can be rejected and so can \"apple\":\na) \"What did he received?\" suggests he was given something.\nb) Lunchbox is just a plural word (plurality makes it a noun), but it is not an answer.

Let's go over each choice step by step:\n\nUsed Car Lot: This would imply the location of the car itself, rather than where the car is sold.\n\nCar Dealership: This choice would require another option, such as Used Car Lot or Garage, to be given the context.\n\nGarage: This would be describing a place where people bring their cars for repairs.\n\nUsed Car Store: This choice is the most likely candidate to meet the context of a place for bargaining, as it likely describes a place where one would buy a used car.\n\nAuto Salesperson: This would be required in the context of a car dealership or used car store, for negotiation. However, it alone does not describe a place or location where you could bargain a car.\n\nStreet: This does not refer to an area where you can bargain a car, but would be describing the process of finding a car on the street, perhaps for sale.\n\nUsed car lot and Used Car Store are the only two choices that would match the context of the question, out of the initial set of options.\n\nThe correct answer, therefore, is C: Used Car Lot because it is a place where you can bargaining for used car.\n\nAnswer: C: Used Car Store\n\n### Instrucure (Part2):\nInput: What should be added to the", "answer": " 2934"}

By looking at all the available options, some of them stand out as more likely locations to finish a job 'on time' than the other options.\nStep 1: We can immediately eliminate the gym. This is a location where students typically go to exercise, which conflicts with the notion of exercises in this particular context.\nStep 2 :Theater (option B) may not be able to be completed at the last minute. Students who go to the gym typically do so with the goal of exercising and may not feel comfortable skipping out. Similarly, students who go to the theater probably do so with the intention of finishing watching a musical or play, which means they probably can't stop mid-way to accomplish their task.\nStep 3 : Office (option D) might indicate that they were working on an assignment. This is not a task that would necessarily be completed \u201con time\u201d.\nStep 4: Library (option E) - While this is an option that fits with the notion of \u201con time\u201d, it could be read two ways.

Choices: 1) They weren't present 2) They just needed cheering up 3) They weren' t listening 4) They weren'r interested 5) They weren'tr motivating themselves\nRationales: Since the question asks us to identify why the teacher was unable to pass along her knowledge to the students, the sentence \"They just needed cheering up\" may make you think that the teacher gave some encouragement or had a positive attitude towards the students.  Even though good advice can help you a lot, it doesn't mean that giving encouragement always makes the person cheerful, so the correct answer is 4: They weren't interested. \nTherefore, this question can be answered using the \"MUST-QUANTITY-QUALITY\" method.\n\nAnswer: D: they just needed cheering up\nInput: What's a more technical term for 'toilet, restroom, lavatory'?

But the difference is that a doctor takes care of your body and a lawyer takes care of your mental health. The first step to becoming a lawyer is to decide what type of lawyer you want to be.  \nIf you are having trouble with your family, marriage lawyers can help you. Divorce lawyers help get you divorced, but there are different types of divorce lawyers. A divorce lawyer who has experience with contested divorces is one who helps the divorcing couple to agree on the important financial issues and the child custody, including visitation and child support issues. \nA divorce lawyer who has expertise in dissolution of marriages may only do uncontested divorces. In the early stages of a divorce, the couple can negotiate the terms of the divorce without requiring the court's help.  \nThe second step to becoming a lawyer requires that you decide what type of case you want to do, such as divorce cases or child support cases. It is common for lawyers to specialize in one type of case. Afterward, you want to do some research about the type of law you're specializing in to see if you have the interest and the time to put into it.  \nChoosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will ever make", "answer": " 96"}

We should explain which one is better since the one in the painting has been fixed. It's very confusing at this point since there is a little bit of a conflict in direction. The painting would have likely been better, though. We need to explain why, by saying we believe the painting is better because it is more detailed. This means that it is more precise or exact. It's interesting to note some of the other words used to describe the buildings (perfect, smooth, etc.) but these words do not really apply to our explanation. So to solve this question, we need to figure out what word can replace the blank to make it an exact description of what we're trying to express.\n\n> It is reasonable to say that the painting is better because we are looking at pictures of buildings and we only have one image to look at.

Choices: A: pink B: red C: golden D: brown E: green\nRationales: We need to understand exactly what a frog is. A frog is a type of amphibian meaning it lives on land and in water. An amphibian is an animal that starts its life in water but lives out its life on land. All frogs lay eggs in water, but hatch on land. After they hatch, they go through a life cycle on land. Then, when they are fully grown frogs, they go to water to reproduce. Most frogs lay eggs in floating mats that float away from shore after they lay their eggs.\nBrown frogs lay their eggs on beaches and the water washes the eggs away. Frogs are not pink or red. They are a variety of colors, but they don't have a red and or pink coat. That is why A is wrong.\nNow we need to get to C. Does it say golden? No, it does not. It says \"golden frog\". \"Golden frogs\" is actually a species of frog that is called the golden frog that lives in Costa Rica. This is why C is wrong", "answer": " 50"}

Choices:  I) They are cousins II) They are enemies III) They are predators IV) They are mates\nRationales: Let's discuss the meaning of the first word used in each sentence. 'Relationship' and 'between' can be read as synonyms, or the use of the former helps to denote the word choice in that sentence.\nI) The sentence says they are related, so they are cousins.\nII) This sentence is talking about different animals and describes their relationship as enemies.\nIII) This sentence is talking only about lions and foxes as animals. It means to talk about animals who eat prey or hunt for food. The relationship between them is because they are predators.\nIV) This sentence talk about animals. Here two males are mates, which means when lions and foxes unite.\nNow looking at the options:\nA) When you use the words 'cousins,' you are referring to family connections. Here the option clearly states that, Lions and foxes are not cousins but they are related to a different family. So, clearly option A is impossible.\nB) When you use the word 'predators', it is used for animals who eat their prey and hunt for food. If you use the word 'enemies', it means they are competitors and fight each other to death. For instance: Lion and fox; Lion and wolf; Lion and leopard; Lion and deer etc. so clearly the lion and foxes are enemies.\nC) The word'mates' is used for animals unite together to produce offspring. For example: Lion and female lion, Lion and tiger etc. Here option C clearly matches the context of the sentence.\nTherefore, the correct option is D) Lions and foxes mates.\n\nAnswer: C) They are predators\n\nInput: A lion is a large, powerful mammal that hunts for, kills, and eats its", "answer": " 6"}

The sentence contains the word 'average', so we must consider this when looking at the answer choices. \nStep 3: In the sentence, there is no specific term that refers to a standard amount of time. A person in the army varies in how long they stay. So the key word in this sentence is 'typically' and not 'normally'.

Answer Choice A: \u201cBoth genders have the same chance of having a dominant hand, a right or left hand\u201d.\n4. A woman may also be right handed, but her chance of being right handed is higher than a man's.\n5. Hence, the probability that a woman is more right-handed than a man is higher than 50 percent, indicating Choice A doesn't fit the question.\n6 Answer Choice B: \u201cA man is more likely to be ambidextrous, or able to use both hands equally well\u201d, doesn't fully meet the question criterion.\n7. A man may be more likely to be able to use both hands, but doesn't necessarily mean that he is more likely to use his right hand than a woman is.\n8. Answer Choice C: \u201cA woman is generally more likely to be dominant with her right hand, whereas a man is usually more likely to be dominant in his left\u201d.\n9. In most contexts where there's an option to use either left or right hand, the dominant hand would be the most frequently preferred one.\n10.

Choices: A: trees B: nest C: rainforest D: jungle E: tropical island\nRationales: We need to find a parrot' nest because we are building a house for it. A:Trees (1) - a nest is placed on a tree, therefore is not likely. B: Nest (2) - similar to answer choice D. Incorrect (nest is not likely). C: Rainforest (3) - not likely. A rainforest is not likely where parrot nests are placed. D: Jungle (4) - not likely. The nests of many species of parrots are placed in palm fronds; not in trees. It is very likely that you will find a nests of parrots on palm fronds. The jungle would not likely be the place where these nests would be placed. E: Tropical Island (5) - not likely. Parrot nests are placed high on the trees. The answer to this question would not like to be found on the ground (i'm making this up, but just trying to give a point across).\nAnswer: C: Rainforest\n\nInput: If the parrot house isn't made properly, it will likely be eaten by what? Choices: A: foxes B: rats C: mice D: birds E: lizards\nRationales: This question is asking about what type of creatures might eat the parrot house if it is not built correctly.\n(A) Foxes: (1) A fox is not likely to eat an entire parrot house, but more likely, they would eat the parrots.\n(B) Rats: (2) They can climb trees, but it is not likely that they eat parrots.\n\n(C) Mice: (3) Mice are likely to enter the parrot's house if not made properly.\n(D", "answer": " 1"}

Choices:  M: airport B: cafe C: library D: forest E: library\nRationales: Let's first see what the question is asking.\nStep 1: The question asks about the most appropriate answer choice for a hacker to use for hiding. Step 2: The answer choice can be a place where hackers can hide.\nStep 3 & 4: Let's see the answer choices individually to see why each one is wrong:\nOption M: There might be a few reasons why this answer choice might be wrong:\n1. The word 'airport' doesn't actually mean an airport that is used for travel. This kind of airport might have no place for a hacker hiding his identity or location, since he would be walking around and would be seen.\n2. The word 'cafe' or \"coffee shop\" means such places are usually more public and open than the library. A library has more privacy and hiding places than a cafe, which is why the cafe might not be a good option for hiding.\nOption B: It's not just that the word 'airport' is wrong again. The question asks for the best hiding place, so it doesn't seem like a good idea to choose it.\nOption C: The word \"library\" may seem right at first glance, but it may actually be a poor choice. Anything with books and shelves can be searched more thoroughly by anyone investigating, possibly revealing the hiding hacker. As an analogy, imagine you are hiding from a monster within a castle, and the monster wants to find you- a library is not where you would hide, because you could be found easily.\nOption D: A forest might seem like a good hiding place at first, because trees can provide a lot of privacy and hiding places. However, imagine an entire group of people were to go into the forest, and one of the group members was being hunted for the monster. The forest can't really help", "answer": " 14400"}

A: firefighter B: flame C: fire-fighter D: fire-extinguisher E: burn\nRationales: In the sentence, 'if there is a fire' refers to a hypothetical situation. The fire refers to what happens when there is a fire: a firefighter will try to put it out. 'flame' refers to the burning itself, and a \"burn\" is what happens when someone gets too close to a fire.\nThere are two different ways to be \"tried\": one way is with \"firefighter' or 'fire-fighter', and another way is with 'burn'.\nThe person who would be trying the hardest is the firefighter, because that is their job.\n\nInput: The box was large enough to hold an entire stack of books on a single shelf Choices:  A is an unspecified noun.  \nB is a verb that means \"to buy\", but it doesn't indicate the time when the books will be bought.\n\nC is a verb that means to \"have the capacity to hold\", but it does not tell us what the capacity is in relation to.\n\nD is an adverb that indicates the duration of the act, but there is not more to the description.\n\nE is a verb that means 'to remove' but does not indicate how or by what.\n\nTherefore, the answer must be E.\nAnswer: E is \"Removed\"\n\nInput: In order to pass, your work must be marked.

Read when you are happy 6. Read when it is raining\nRationales: Let's take each point one by one.\n1. Read at night: If someone is being asked to read at night, the question might ask about their habits or normal procedure. In that case, the choice might be right, but we can not select it because the \"best\" results can probably only be achieved by someone who is rested.\n2. Read when you're thirsty: If someone has just consumed more water than he is thirsty, then he might be able to get better results. This could occur when someone is over hydrated and does not have thirst.\n3. Read when it's warm: If someone is feeling cold and thus thirsty, then it might be a good idea for him to drink something warming, such as a cup of tea. When someone feels warm and is thirsty, it might improve their reading performance.\n4. Read in a cool place: If someone is hot, it might be better for them to read in a cool place so they feel refreshed. Like other cases, there aren't many possibilities except cool place and warm place. If someone is hot, he might read in a cool place.\n5. Read when you'll be happy: This is similar to read at night and read when you are thirst. Happiness or unhappiness won't have an effect on reading, and therefore this choice is wrong.\n6. Read when it'll be raining: If the person has an umbrella, and it's raining, he might get better results. He probably won't get better results if there's no rain at first place, though.\nTo sum up, the best answer is \"cool place\".\nAnswer: E.

Choices: 1. \"Fine.\" 2. \"The fishing is awful.\" 3. \"The fishing isn't great.\" 4. \"The weather is unpredictable.\" 5. \"The lake is choppy.\" \nRationales: We can conclude that the weather is probably not in a good state to facilitate fishing, but we are not given the exact state of the condition.\n1. We need to determine which option among A-E is best. We eliminate answer choice A because it seems unnatural for a fisherman to react positively in this situation.\n2. We look at choice B, which is 'The fishing is awful'. However, it's not necessarily certain that the weather is awful. \n3. The fishing may be unlucky or the fish may be in a different area or another fisherman may have already caught all the fish.\n4. So we eliminate option B.\n5. Option C is 'The fishing isn' t great'. It implies that fishing may be mediocre compared to other situations, but is still generally acceptable. Again, it may be due to an unpredictable weather, but that is not definitively stated.\n6. Lastly, option D is 'The weather is unpredictbale'. It tells us that the weather could change quickly, making the condition favorable sometimes and unfavorable at others. It may indicate that fishing is bad at the moment, but the circumstances can change.\n7. Therefore option D is the best one to describe the situation.\nAnswer: \"The weather is unpredicatable\"\n\nInput: How is the weather if it's clouded?Choices: 1. A: stormy 2. B: fine 3.

Miles per hour? Choices: 100 200 300 400 500\nRationales: A good player who travels 4.30 miles per hour can beat a bad driver. Hence a bad driver can be anyone who is not a good player, hence the bad driver travels at what?\n\n400 mph and 500 mph do not seem to be reasonable, hence we can eliminate the options.

There are 4 options given in the question :\nA: If you answer \u201cyes\u201d then it means everything is cheaper than the \u201casking\u201d price.\nB: If you answer \u201cno\u201d then it means not all prices are cheaper than the \u201c asking price\u201d\nC: If you answer \u201cprobably\u201d then it means you are not sure if there are any items cheaper in price than the asking.\nStep 4. In this case, because all the items that are being mentioned in the question are being compared to the asking price it has to be a \u201cyes or no\u201d so the only question which is a \u201cyes or no question\u201d will be \u201cA\u201d.

The answers that are places are B: Map and C: Country\nStep 5. Eliminating the other two answers, we are able to see that D: Map and E: World are the two remaining options, one of which will show deserts.\nStep 6. Looking at answer choices, the word \"world\" does not make it clear that deserts are shown on the map, but \"map\" does by virtue of showing place and location.\nStep 7. Thus, since we only have two options E: World and D: Map, we first need to establish when \"map\" is used to signify a location or place.\nStep 8. D: Map is a tool used to represent place.\nStep 9.

In the fridge\nRationales: Given what is written, a painter has a cabinet, studio, shelf, garage, or fridge. What's going to fit the best in a cabinet?\n1. cabinets usually cannot store a large number of items, like brushes. For example, a cabinet in the room where I sleep would not be able to store all of the books I read.\n2. A painter who had brushes in his cabinet would have a lot of trouble using those brushes because he wouldn't be able to find them quickly.\n3. The same goes for the studio and the shelf. There are many more paintings/things hanging on each of those, and it would take the painter a long time to find the brushes.\n4. The fridge is too small for a painter to find the brush even if it was there.\n5. A painter keeps his brushes in his garage when he's not painting or storing them in a drawer at home.\n\n### Expected Response:\n### Detailed Explanation:\n1. Answer: C: In the garage\n2.

Choices:  'A' : The chair had a faulty part. 'B' : The chair had been recalled. 'C' : The man was working too fast. 'D' : The chair was on a steep staircase. 'E' : The chair was not secured correctly.\nRationales:\nStep 1:  The sentence gives us some clues to answer the question - \u201cThe man's accident\".\nStep 2: The choice that refers to \"The man's accident\" is \"B\". Since other choices doesn't include the \"mans\" in it, one cannot use this choice to answer.\nStep 3 The two choices that remain \"C\" and \"D\" have the context that the mans accident happened at work and the man himself is injured or ill from the accident.\nStep 4 \"The chair was on a steap staircase.\" talks about the location where the accident happened. Hence it cannot be used to answer the question.\nStep 5 The choice whose context is only related to the cause that could have been the reason for the accident is \" 'E' : The Chair was not secured correctly.\"\nStep 6 Since \"The chair was not secured correctly\" has nothing to do with the location where the accident occured i.e. at work, we can safely conclude that \" 'E' :The Chair was not secured correctly\" is the answer.\nAnswer: \"The chair was not correctly secured\" is what caused the man's accident.\n\nInput: How does a person get the job of making a TV show?

Choices: \tA: wealthy B: broke C: poor D: rich E: middle class\nRationales Step 1: The wording of the question implies that we should find a term that is a synonym (or antonym) for the given word.\nStep 2. Looking at the options for \u201crich,\u201d we can identify two main ways to refer to being rich: by focusing on the possession of wealth and by focusing on the lack of poverty.\nStep 3. By considering this contrast, we can eliminate choices C and E, as they refer to being without such wealth or poverty, respectively.\nStep 4. Choices A and B are synonyms in the sense that \u201cwealthy\u201d describes the state of having a lot of resources (possessions and/or money), which is the same as \u201crich.\u201d\nStep 5.

It fits best since it's an option about leaving the air-plane for fuel.\n2 B: Is a hangar, which is a place you put your air-plane where it's safe and where it can even be refueled, but that doesn't answer the question.\n3 C: Is the sky, and in that case it doesn't even have to be fueled again. So, it's not a matter.\n4 D: Is the ocean, which isn't a place your plan has to stay. It actually goes down to the ocean to be refueled, so it obviously doesn't fit best.\n5 E: Is the clouds, and that means it'd be refueled at that location but wouldn't remain there.\n\nAnswer. E: The clouds: The air-plane stays in the clouds for a certain amount of time until they move to somewhere else to refueled.

If this wasn't true, then he would have \"saw\" something in the woods, but the context talks about the'redhot iron'.

Fish: This can refer to a large shark, but it\u2019s not as likely to have such a large shark in an aquarium as it is to see a pool table in a bar.\n2. Pool table: We could say the person is seeing a pool table, but we don\u2019t see a shark in the answer which would be required to use the shark and pool table.\n3. Aquarium with a pool table: This sounds like an aquarium is in the bar, but we don\u2019 see a shark in there.\n4. Pairing an aquarium and pool table: This is plausible if we say the aquarium is where the shark is, but we don\u2019 know the answer to be such. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to consider the option.\n5. Aquarium: This could describe an aquarium that is being watched by someone, but we don\u2019 t know it that there was a shark inside of the aquarium or at the bar in the first place.\n6. Pool table: This choice makes the least amount of sense out of all the answers. The shark knows what it\u2019s doing, which is why it\u2019s a shark and not a fish.

Looking at the choices, we can see they are each describing a problem.\nWe can eliminate Choice A because 'no funds' is describing one of the problems.\nSimilarly, Choice B describes a problem, not an issue (as the term issue typically denotes a situation's severity and relevance).\nLikewise, Choice C describes a specific problem.\nSo, from choices left, only Choice D can be the answer.

In this case, \"on the left\" and \"box\" can already point to a container with contents. When combined with \"material\" and \"different\", we know that it must be looking for a choice that refers to the material the box is made of.\n\nNext, the important clues here are a \"different\" material and \"of\": as the word \"of\" is used (on the left is of a material) it is not as if they are both made of the same material, but different materials, hence we know that the material on the left must be different from the material on the right.\n\nNow we consider each option:\n\nMetal is most likely an example of a different material than plastic, hence option a is not likely.\n\nWood and plastic would be considered different, hence options b & c are still possible.\n\nHowever, acrylic is made from plastic, so option d is not possible because they are, in fact, made of a different material.

However, a straw hat and lemons would not be commonly found in this setting, since these items would not be useful for people attending this market.\n(D) beach: This is an outdoor location where people commonly go to relax and enjoy the ocean.

This question is asking about the chef's belief that there is no such thing as (a) \"single\"  \"perfect\" bite of food.\n2. The chef is trying to emphasize that, while one bite may not be perfect, bites combined can still be delicious. It is about the collective effort and experience of several imperfect bites in making something special and delicious. \n3. Options A, C, and E use the word \"perfect\" to mean \"exactly as it is supposed to be,\" while this option does not use \"perfect\" in the same way.  The answer, \"G. Many ingredients,\" is the best choice because it uses the word \"perfectly\" - instead of \"perfect\" - to mean \"delightful\", instead of \"exactly as it should be.\" \n4.

We are looking for the sentence in which \"their\" is being used as a plural pronoun to refer to two or more people.\nStep 3. Let's examine each option carefully.\nA: The correct answer choice is A. The pronouns used are A) the singular 'their', which belongs to plural people in reference to'she', and the phrase 'her audience', which is also plural. Hence, it satisfies the plural requirements and is the correct answer choice.\nB: The pronoun used in this option is plural, BUT also refers to something belonging to singular person, \u2018her\u2019.

A: lucky guess B: intuition C: trial D: theory\nRationales:\n\n1.'What is the best answer?' doesn't quite give enough information to answer the question correctly. \n2. Let' s look at the answer choices:\n\n'Guess' - A guess is a form of intuition, therefore we can eliminate (C) as an option - the question asks how the fisherman knew to try the new bail he was considering using. Answer: A: lucky guess.\n\n\nThe question mentions that the fisherman was considering trying a new bait. This means that he was deliberate about his choice and wasn't 'just experimenting' or 'testing.' 'Intuition' is a bit too open ended; if the fisherman was using intuition (C) then he used more than just that; he needed to use logic to know what fish would bite what type of bait.\n\nWe know that the question has eliminated (C), we can rule out (A) as an option because (D) is the best answer; this means the fisherman used a theory to choose his new bait.\n\nThe fisherman tested the new bait on a fish that was similar (in size and type) to a fish he wanted to use the bait on. Since he hadn't been successful catching this type of fish before, he may have tried (intuition and trial) or (theory) to have a better chance to'sell' the bait, so using (D) as the best answer.\n\nAnswer: <p>D: Theory</p>\n\n\nInput: When is it advisable to use a knife?

Let's first break down the question by:\n2. \"Where\" can be described as noun (place) or verb (location).  \n3. Since it is describing location in this question, let us keep looking at location.\n4. \"Biggest\" can be expressed as a noun (biggest, adj - the size or amount) or a verb (biggest, v - to make something larger or more important).  \n5. Since \"biggest\" is describing an adjective, let us look for an answer choice that could be an adjective.  \n6. \"Gargoyle\" (noun) is a sculpture or animal of mythically grotesque appearance.  \n7. \"Giraffe\"  (noun) is one of the tallest living animals, with a long neck and long legs.  \n8. \"Crocodile\"  (noun / non-living) is a large and dangerous carnivorous reptile with a long body, large head, and very powerful jaws.  \n(I have marked the nouns in green.)  \n9.

She asked which one of her students was responsible for what? Choices: A: missing books B: missing homework C: missing assignment D: missing test E: missing work\nRationales: First, notice that if a student missed something, then it was 'done by' someone. For example, someone missed books but they were not missing by themselves, rather they were missing by one student. If a student did something, the question asks, which one of her students did it?\nNext, we should take note that students would likely not miss one type of assignment, they would most likely miss both items. And when asked by a teacher, it would be natural to assume a student did both of the things, since, as mentioned already, if a student, student, did something, they did both items.\nThus, student B is the missing ones, because they are doing all the types of missing items, and not just one, like student A would do.\nNote that because student B does everything, it is assumed that they are responsible for whatever action that is meant to be done by student A.\nThe teacher doesn't need to assign blame, because student A wasn't missing anything, and student B was responsible for all missing items.\nAnswer: B", "answer": " 35"}

Choices: A: it gains weight B: it sheds energy C: it stays the same D: it gains muscle E: it remains the same\nRationales:\n1. The question asks about what happens to the \"body\" when we exercise, which suggests we need to think of an effect that occurs on the human body.\n2. Looking at the options given, none of them directly specify the type of body part they refer to. This information is important: a person's energy is generated in the cellular level, while the rest of the body stays the same during physical activity.\n3. Therefore, Choice B: \"it gains energy\" is the incorrect answer because it doesn't match the context of the question and lacks the detail that the body gains energy. \n4. Similarly, option D: \"it gains muscle\" is also incorrect because while it can occur, this choice is too specific to fit with the context of the entire body gaining energy.\n5. Next, option C: \"it stays the same\" is incorrect because the question already explicitly says that the body remains the same while we exercise, so therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.\n6. This leaves only options A and E as plausible options to answer the question.\n7. However, option A: \"it gains weight\" does not make sense because exercising doesn't necessarily cause weigh gain, and is instead associated with weight loss. \n8. Thus, option E: \"it remains the same\" is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E. it remains the same\n\nInput: There are 44 countries in Europe.

D: they were confused if it was a pony or a donkey. 5. E: pigeons can talk to other birds but not talking to humans.\nRationales for this question: \n1. Option A: Carrion is a dead bird that smells bad. Carrion is a noun. Both pigeon and dove are birds and birds do not smell bad. \n2. Option B: Living and dead things have the same names in English. The word 'dead' does not modify the word 'carrion' or any other words in the sentence. There is no mistake in their reading of the name carrion. \n3. Option C:'I saw a pigeon' and 'I saw a dove' both describe the same event. Nothing about this sentence makes it more likely that they were worried. \n4. Option D: Pony is a type of dog and donkey is a type of horse. They were not worried about these creatures.\n5. Option E: They were not able to talk to many animals and they were not specifically worried about this ability.

No, you would go in the direction in which you came, which usually would lead you back to where you came, hence the sentence \"go back to where...\" is likely meant to return to where you came from. \n\nStep 5: All words have multiple meanings.

Choices:  TAXES\nRationales: In this sentence, \"If the government is working with me\" means that the government is helping me in some way. For example, if I have a problem and the government helps me to solve it, then the government is working with us.\nOption 1 (A): This is not true. When I have a problem and I ask for help from other people, I sometimes need to pay them. For example I ask my friends to help me study, and I may need to pay for a drink or food to thank them.\nOption 2 (B): This is not true, and the same as above. I can pay my teachers at my school or university. My friends also sometimes have problems, and I ask them to help me. I may need to pay them for their help. Example: My friend has problems with her boyfriend, and I speak to her. She likes me to pay for dinner when we go together.\nOption 3 (C): False. Sometimes governments ask people to pay taxes. However, if I work with the government I don't need to pay taxes. Sometimes governments want people or companies to pay taxes because they feel that they are doing something useful for the country. If I work with the government, I will pay taxes anyway. I just have a different kind of job so I don't need taxes from my income from that job.\nOption 4 (D): False. In this case, the government is working with the person, so that the person is not paying taxes. If I work with a government I will NOT pay taxes.\nOption 5 (E): True. Sometimes, the government and people work together to solve problems like homelessness or unemployment. In these cases, you would pay taxes because you are a government employee.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: He has been running nonstop for an hour.

Some examples of nouns are \"lions\" or \"jewels.\"\nStep 2. Consider the options. \nOption A: \"large fish\" is referring to a noun, not an adjective. It describes a kind of animal. It's likely the choice \"shark\" is referring to a human being, and this option does not represent the correct meaning.\nOption B: \"intelligent being\" can be a synonym for 'person'. It's an adjective that helps describe what kind of person. It's a suitable option to consider but likely too detailed.\nOption C: \"predator\" is referring to the kind of person who is described by \"shark\". It could be the correct answer, and the question stem may be referring to the predator's characteristics.\nThe question stems asks about what \"shark\" is, so it makes sense for the 'predator' definition to be implied here.\nOption D: 'competent' is a word that indicates skill or confidence.\nThe word \"sharks\" refers to an educated, competent person, not an expert.

This shows that it is a shark who is playing the game of golf, and not a shark acting as the ball or player.\nChoices:\n1. The player - This cannot be the correct answer because if it were chosen, the question would be irrelevant because an animal cannot play golf, and the context refers to playing golf as a game by a human player.\n2.

Choices:  A. profit statement, as this shows if the company makes enough money to cover its costs. B. balance sheet, as this shows the company's assets and debts. C. cash flow statement, which shows inflow and outflow of the money. D. cost accounting, which measures the cost of producing goods. E. income statement, which shows total income and total expenses that the company makes in a period of time. (Not sure if this is the official response though. This might be more suitable for people who already understand how balance sheets work)\nRationales:\nFor the question, we need to answer where money is likely to be useful if a company is making losses. This implies two facts :\n1. The word'money' does not refer to the amount of profit the company makes. Rather, it means the amount the company has to cover its expenses. In other words, it refers to the revenue - Expenses or profit(if any) that the company makes.\n2. The'making losses part' means the company is losing money or at a loss. This implies - if a company is at a loss, it is not making enough revenues to cover its expenses and/or making losses. Hence, if a company is making a loss, money will not be much of use since it will be used to cover losses not revenues.\n\nHence, we should choose an option which will indicate either if the company makes enough revenue to cover its expenses or if it is making losses. A cash flow statement which measures the inflow and outflow should help answer that question.\n\nHence we should choose \"Cash flow statement\".\n\nInput: If an expert in their field, where would they typically be working?

Let's go through them one by one:\n\nStep 1: \"a\" contains the letter \"A\".\nStep 2: Similarly, \"b\" contains the letter \"B\".\nStep 3: Likewise, \"c\" contains the letter \"C\".\nStep 4: Finally, \"d\" contains the letter \"D\".\n(E is the only word that does not contain any letters.) \n\nStep 5: This means \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\" are all incorrect, so E is the correct answer.\nAnswer: E\n\nInput: Which is the biggest? Choices:  B: B D: D C: A E: E F: F\nRationales: Based on the choices given, it's difficult to determine the biggest among them.\n\nStep 1. Looking at them, the only letters that are identical are C and E.\nStep 2. While letters may have some resemblance like the case of \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018E\u2019, these are not exactly the same, hence, these words cannot be compared in terms of size. Thus, choices \u2018B\u2019, \u2018D\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018A\u2019, are irrelevant as they do not contain the same alphabet.\nStep 3. Answer choices which begin with \u2018F\u2019 like \u2018F\u2019 and \u2018F\u2019 cannot be used as measure of size as these letters are not even adjacent to each other in the English language.\nStep 4.

Choices: 1. A: No 2. B: Probably not 3. C: Maybe not 4. D: Not as far as we know 5. E: Not at this point \nRationales: In this dialogue, it's not specified whether the artist sells his paintings. The question is asking for information about the artist's work, but it doesn't specify whether the paintings are for sale or not. Therefore, the answer choices should not assume either option to be true or false.\n6. Therefore \"No\" and \"Not at this point\" are incorrect as they assume that the artist does not sell his paintings.\n7. \"Maybe not\" is incorrect as it assumes that the artist may not sell his paintings, but doesn't provide evidence that supports this belief.\n8. \"Not as far as we know\" is incorrect because it doesn't provide evidence to support the belief that the artist doesn't sell his paintings. It's assumed that either the interviewer or the interviewer's friend knows enough about the artist to make such a determination, but this information is not provided.\n9. \"Probably not\" is incorrect because it assumes that the artist does not usually sell his paintings, which is not provided in the question.\n\n10.

Choices:\n\nThe answer could also be the Pacific Ocean.\n\nInput (5): Where did you last play tennis with a shark?\n\nYou could also answer 'Pacific Ocean' with choice C.\n\nInput (6): Where is it most likely the shark works? Choices:\n1. The question is a bit vague since 'works' in this context could mean more than one thing.\n2. The question specifically asks where the shark works. Therefore, let's start from the location 'a shark' works in.\n3. All the locations except 'office' can be places where expert sharks can live.\n4. Therefore, the answer does not depend on the location where the shark works, but rather, the actual work that an expert shark can accomplish.\n5. Now, let's consider the meaning of 'work' in context of the shark.\n6. An expert shark is someone who makes 'a living' from playing the game.\n7. 'A living' is something that someone can \"make\" as work, so 'work' could be a way to refer to a source of income.\n8. As a result, 'work' can also be more broadly interpreted as something that takes up a person's time and energy.\n9. These interpretations of work generally suggest the answer as a game.\n10. Amongst the options that refer to games, the two options that refer to the word 'play' most accurately are 'pool hall' and 'beach'.\n11.

It makes sense to ask how one might increase muscle. This means you may either increase the mass of the muscles in terms of absolute size, or reduce fat to increase muscle as a proportion of total mass. The other suggestions (endurance, mobility and coordination) don't seem related to building muscle to any significant extent.\nAnswer: B A: by building endurace B: by building musle C: by gaining momentum D: by developing coordinaion E: by training in marital arts\n\nInput: How long might an elephant need to swim to a destination?

Thus, this is the best answer choice.\nStep 7: 'pool hall' is an idiomatic expression that means an area where we engage in billiards.\nStep 8: Therefore, based on all the considerations we can conclude that the best response to the question is D: \"pool hall\".\nAnswer: D: pool hall\n\nInput: The store had what in stock, a limited amount, a choice, two or more? Choices: 1. A: selection 2. B: variety 3. C: excess 4. D: scanty 5. E: surplus\nRationales: This is an exercise that will help us strengthen our problem solving skills. \n\n1. 'In stock' is a pre-phrase that is used to suggest that a particular item is currently available in the store.\n\n2. For the question to be answered we need to understand the meaning of the other phrase, 'a limited amount'.\n\n3. 'Limited amount' could convey a sense of scarcity or shortage.\n\n4. Amongst the answers,'scanty' and'surplus' could both make sense, depending on how one interprets 'in stock'.\n\n5. But if we assume that what is 'in stock' is a limited amount (in the sense of shortage), then this would be a perfect example of 'excess' (in the sense of more than enough), since 'in stock' describes a scenario where there are only a few items left in the store.\n6. Thus 'excess' would be considered as opposed to 'limited amount'. \n7.

Choices:  B: corn nibbler C: corn cobber D: corn nib E: corn cobb\nRationales: (Answers: C/B)\nStep 1: The question contains the words \"you use\" but no person is mentioned. \nStep 2: Using the words in sequence, the phrase 'you use' should mean 'with these words, what do you use to...' \nStep 3: Looking at the options, we know that there are only two types of corn: corn on the cob and corn in a cob.\nStep 4. The term 'corn nibbler' can refer to any of these two options. As the context of 'use' is ambiguous, we have to interpret option B as meaning 'to eat the plant or its parts' and option C as 'to remove the cob'\nStep 5. Hence, the answer is likely to be either option B or option C.\nStep 6. The answer can be identified through some deduction, for example if 'corn cobber' is the answer, we have to assume that option B means \"corn cobber\" which implies removing the cob. However, this seems too obvious an assumption and is not correct since all the options only imply the one or the other. \nStep 7. Using the words 'to remove the cobb', we can deduce that the answer is either B or C. A: corn nibbling and E: corn cobb refers to eating the whole corn plant. Hence, the answer has to be C: corn cob or B: corn nibble, and C and B mean the same.\nStep 8. Looking at the context of the rest of the question, 'cob' implies removing and 'cobb' implies leaving it.

Choices:  No A: Certainly B: Certain C: Of course D: Definitely E: Definitely not\nRationales: Explanation:\nStep 1: The question asks about someone's opinion of a rapper. This implies that the listener and the speaker agree about the quality of the music of the rapper.\nStep 2. There are four possible answers: 'No', 'Certainly', 'Of course' and 'Definitely'. Each answer is given a rating out of four according to how positive and definitive it is. No answer gets zero out of four for being the opposite of the question. The more positive an answer is, the greater the rating.\nStep 3. If you're a fan, you'd be more positive or enthusiastic in your answer. If you're not a fan, you'll be more negative or you might even say \"he's not my kind of rap.\"\nStep 4. Looking at the answers, 'certainly' and 'of course' are very positive and definitive. You can't answer any more positively or more definitive than these. These options therefore must be the best ones.\nStep 5. Let's see how the other answers compare:\nCertainly = 3\nOf course = 3\nThe choices 'No' and 'Definitely' have been rated lower.\nStep 6. Comparing these two options, 'No' doesn't say very much. It's vague and it's almost a non-answer. This doesn't fit with positive and definitive answers we are looking for.\nStep 7. For the same reason, 'Definitely' gets one rating point lower than 'Of course'. Also, it doesn't specify which opinion the person holds. It can be positive (\"yeah he's definitely my favourite,\" or it could be negative (\"nah he's not my kind\"). This option is vague and doesn't fit with the positive and definitive answer we are looking", "answer": " 14000"}

It is known that, at this time and in most locations, people on trains don't typically play chess on their devices; they only play chess in person.\nStep 3. Train riders' behavior may be influenced by the presence of a few nearby places, or could be impacted by the lack of choice.\nStep 4. Looking at the train's interior, it is impossible to play with one's neighbor.\nStep 5. It is very difficult to play on the wall because of the lack of space.\nStep 6. In the train's cabin, there is no seat that is near a window.\nStep 7. Adjacent to a train station platform is a logical choice for playing the game.\nStep 8.

Likewise, choice C: where the dishes was created might be used, however the diners were in the room, and this topic does not seem to have been covered.\n4. Choices B: the dish or D: the preparation would be relevant choices.\n5. Choices B and D both require elaboration as to why the discussion involved the dish or preparation, which also implies that there may be more to the topic than is simply explained.\n6.

The answer choice D is not likely. Since A, B, and D are all valid answers, we will have to check which one makes the story more logical by looking at what events follow it.\nStep 4. The answer choice B describes events that contradicts A. The computer broke down, and the girl was now confused and angry. However, if she was angry, then she almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be confused, as that emotion would be too strong for her to feel two emotions simultaneously, especially two strong ones like angry and confused. That suggests that the narrator was probably confused, but not angry. Thus, the answer should be B.\nAnswer: B.

The book explains who Alexander the Great was and gives an account of his role in history in both words and pictures.  \nRationales: In the text, \"a\" denotes an and, and \"the\" refers to a or an. This is a conjunction (that connects two words or phrases), which is used to join together two parts of a sentence that express related ideas or concepts.  \nIn the context of the book, \"The author gives an explanation\" means \"The author is explaining.\" Since the author is the first person to be introduced, \"The book\" is then the direct object of \"explains,\" as it is what the author is explaining to the reader.  \nThe phrase \"an account of\" means \"a story about.\" Therefore, the full phrase \"an account of...\" describes the main part of what the book is about, which is Alexander the Great. Thus, the part that is being explained to the reader in the book is the author's explanation of who Alexander the Great was as well as the story about his role in history, which makes the answer B, Alexander the Great.\nInput: In the painting, the artist B: portrays Queen Victoria A: depicts George IV  \nRationales\nThe pronoun \"Her Majesty is the Queen\" describes an image of Queen Victoria which is depicted in the painting.

Load can be used to indicate the number of objects like vehicles that can be moved on or over a bridge.\n\nB: Traffic- traffic refers to the flow of vehicles on a road or street. In the context of a bridge, it is not appropriate.\n\nC: Cars- cars are cars and do not fit here.\n\nD: Pressure- pressure refers to force exerted on an object and to test the strength of a bridge would not require to generate pressure.\n\nE: heavy- heavy is too general and does not indicate the amount of weight, and also does not align with the fact that a bridge is tested before its ready for use.\n\nTherefore the right answer must be E: Heavy\nAnswer: E: heavy\n\nInput: One is one, and a thousand can be written with two words.

Choices:  a) hive b) beehive c) bees d) flowers E) a store that sells honey\nRationales: Looking at the options, the answer can't be honey, flowers, or a store that sells bees. These are all nouns, not verbs/adjectives. Therefore, they can't be the answer. Also, option D, \"bees\", is the plural form of the word \"bee,\" which in this context is referring to a specific bee. Bees are not always found in honey pots, so this option can't be the correct answer either. Hence, we are left with just three options: \"a\", \"b\", and \"c\". However, the only option which could possibly be an appropriate answer is \"b\". This is because the phrase \"honey pot\" refers to a particular location, not an attribute or a quality. There are no locations or places that are specific to the word \"honey\", as it's a noun denoting the substance itself. So, the sentence could not possibly imply that a person who is looking for something they can use to store honey would look in a \"hive\" location.\nSentence: If you want to know whether a friend of yours is telling the truth, how could you find out?

Choices: A: pencil B: award C: brush D: dog E: pen\nRationales: (Note: \"pencil\" in the question is not referring to a writing instrument)\nStep 1: \"The dog\" in this question is a metaphor, referring to an artwork created by the artist.\nStep 2. The artist drew the dog (metaphorical artwork) with such skill that he/she was awarded \"an award\".\nStep 3: \"award\" is an adjective that describes the award the artist received for drawing the dog.\nStep 4. The word 'award' must be modified by something that indicates what it is an award for. \nStep 5. Since award is used as an adjective to refer to \"an award\" received for drawing the dog, the only adverbial phrase that would modify 'award' is 'for drawing', not \"for winning\".\nStep 6. Thus, \"for drawing\" is not a valid phrase to fit the sentence's context.\nStep 7. Looking at the remaining answer choices, we can eliminate \"pen\" because this does not make sense as the reward for the artist.\nStep7. In conclusion, the only answer choice that is grammatically correct and logically appropriate is 'dog', and 'dog' can only come before 'drawing', in order to describe the artist's skill.\nResult: Therefore, to complete the sentence, we need to change the sentence to:\n\"The artist sketched the dog drawing (with) such finesse that he was awarded a dog\".\nTherefore, the answer is E - a dog.\nAnswer: E - a dog\n\n### Reference:\nhttps://www.grammarbook.com/punctuation/question_marks.asp", "answer": " 146"}

However, after some thought, I think the key idea is to pick the answer choice that is associated with chewing a particularly large piece of food that requires careful chewing.\n\nMy thought process was thus. (Step A) The question says that the giraffe \"chews its cud.\" If the cud were the food item the giraffe eats, then, (Step B) the question is asking how a giraffe chews its cud. This is why option C is incorrect - because chewing a cud is a byproduct of eating food and not the act of chewing and swallowing. I also found \"biting\" as an appropriate answer due to its connotation with consuming food, and \"biting very slowly\" as an incorrect answer because \"very\" goes the contrary to the word \"slowly.\"\n\nAnswer: Option F, \"by biting,\" is an appropriate answer because it makes sense to infer that a large animal like a giraffe would chew its cud slowly, as to not choke and choke. By \"biting\" slowly, the giraffe is chewing its cud, and that's the reason the answer is option F.\nAnswer: Option F: By biting.\n\nInput: How many dogs would you need to create a whole team?

So we have to get the option that says\n\"fix the watch\", since we are not asked what to do if it is not slow.\n\nStep 2: If the watch is slow, we have to \"set it to time\", because setting it to clock and second is not the right action.\n\nStep 3: If the watch is running slow, there's a problem.

Choices B: capable, A: confident, C: able, E: competent\nRationales: Question: Your boss needs you to tell him/her...\nStep 1: The key idea is that \"your boss\" has a need. This is to be described by the sentence that follows.\nStep 2. The sentences after the question generally give very specific information (see the following answer). This means that what comes before the question (the question itself) is very specific as well.\nStep 3. Looking at the set of answers, it's obvious that the answer to the question itself is also very specific; one possible answer could be \"you are a person\". That's absurd, so something more specific would be chosen.\nStep 4. There are many different jobs in this world (in a company) - people doing different kinds of things.\nStep 5. The job of a boss is to lead or manage; this fits well when describing someone in a supervisory or managerial role.\nStep 6. The other jobs are to do more specific jobs. We might be a manager's employee, and our job would then be what our boss tells us to do. It could be accounting (E), or fixing computers (C), or doing mailings (B) - any job as requested by the manager.\nStep 7. Looking at this, it's clear that the answer to the specific question cannot be \"you are a company manager\" or \"that you are an employee\" (C, E), since the other possibilities do not fit well, and the question itself is rather specific.\nStep 8. That leaves us with only B: the boss needs to know that you can do the job he/she has given you.

Where is the hole? Choices: A: stomach B: armpit C: neck D: front pocket E: pocket\nRationales: To answer, let's look at the options and break them down :\nChoices A and B: Both choices refer to parts of the body, meaning these options are not the place where the hole is located.\nChoice C: Neck is the place where a shirt is fastened. However, it is also a place where you'd hang a picture on the wall. There is no indication that a neck can possibly hold a hole. Further, the question does not allude towards any attachment.\nChoice D: Front pockets indicate that the hole is the inside of the shirt. However, front pockets are not large enough to store a hole with its entirety.\nChoice E: Pocket is a piece of fabric. It does not indicate that there could be a hole inside the pocket. Hence, this option is incorrect.\nTherefore, A is right: the answer is: 'B: armpit'\n\nInput: If someone is a doctor, what can they do?

Choices:  N/A A: going on a vacation B: getting their car fixed C: saving money to go to Hawaii D: eating food at a restaurant E: buying necessities such as clothing and shoes\nRationales: To answer this question, it's important to understand what type of activity is associated with spending money, which helps to identify the correct answer choice. In this case, it's clear that the correct answer choice will be a specific activity that people often perform when they're on tight budget.\n\nTo start off, the first three answer choices (A-C) are not relevant, because they're all about activities that people may engage in when they have plenty of money available to spend.\n\nThe next four answer choices (D-E) discuss activities related to spending money when one is on a tight budget. However, the problem here is that they only refer to spending money in general and do not specifically state an activity, such as shopping, eating out, etc. which match the prompt question's clue that activity is being looked for.\n\nTherefore, the last answer choice (F) with the specific activity \"buying necessities such as\" clearly fits the prompt question's requirement and is a correct answer choice.\n\nAnswer: F: buying necessities\n\nInput: It's easy to get lost if you're unfamiliar about which roads are which.

Choices:  a: stairs B: the stairs C: stairway D: stair case E: the stair case\nRationales: A: a stair is a single step. This answer choice is not correct.\nB: the stairs refers to the word 'the' before the word'step', which is not how the sentence is written.\nC: stairway refers to a path consisting of stairs or steps. This answer choice is incorrect because the doctor recommended the patient not take the stairway, not just stairs.\nD: stair case refers to the case where stairs are kept together for easy transports to other floors or levels. This does not refer to any stairs in the sentence, and is not correct.\nE: The stair case refers to a path that comprise a collection of stairs or steps together to make the ascent.

Choices A, B and D are incorrect because they are much too long of a distance between Melbourne and Sydney and would take far longer than a day to travel.\n3.

Since the question talks about explanation or understanding, we can eliminate 'I can't' as irrelevant to the task.\nStep 3. Similarly, the option 'I can't explain anything.' makes it clear that the person can't explain anything and is not answering the question.\nStep 4. 'B' and 'C' give a different option that is not what the question is asking for. 'B' talks about 'not' explain and 'C' talks about explain something\nto someone. 'B' explains that it's impossible to explain something not having an explanation and 'C' tallies that it's possible to explain something to someone.

This somewhere must have specific attributes (e.g., it is found in a school) where kids usually spend their time.\nLooking at the choices, we can quickly eliminate \"trash\" since it is not a location where kids would often hang out (e.g. at school in a lunch room or play ground).\n\nHence, the location can only be A or B or C or D.\n\nFrom here on we can determine that \"school\" is incorrect because this \"school\" is not only a school but also an educational place where children go, and this does not fulfil the criterion of the question, as the question mentions \"somewhere\".\n\nSo, let's see if we can reject \"lunch room\" as it does not satisfy the requirement that we must have some criterion as to why \"school bag\" is not the place where this child's lunch is found.\n\nThe only candidate left here is \"lunch room\".\n\nSo we can conclude that this is the place where the child's luch is found.\n\nAnswer: D.lunch room\n\nInput: A turtle is a species of reptile. Choices:  A reptile B water snake C amphibian  D salamander\nRationales: A turtle, although a reptile, is also a species of amphibious mammal, because it spends most of its life in water and lives in an aquatic environment, despite its reptilian roots.\n\nFurthermore, given that the question is in complete form, a turtle is an animal that is not a member of the amphibian and snake families. In this case, the salamander and water snake are irrelevant.\n\nThus, the answer is B, a reptile", "answer": " 370"}

Choices: \u23a2  A: airplane B: bus C: automobile D: train E: limousine\nRationales: \"Where\" should always refer to a place (not a person). 1. In this context, the sentence 'Where did Mary go for the fiesta?' implies Mary's location, but not Mary as a person.\n2. The sentence makes sense about a fiesta (party) that Mary attended. Therefore, the answer should be a place that people attend fiestas.\n3. Let's go over the options for answers:\n4. \u23a2 \u23a2(A) An airplane: Although airplanes can bring people to a place, you can't attend the event inside of an airplane, so this answer is out.\n5. \u23a2\u23a2 (B) A bus: People ride in a bus. Thus, even if we consider the place as the fiesta location, we can't attend it in a bus. Also, people cannot attend a fiesta while on a bus.

The expression \"It was a bun\" is grammatically incorrect, it is not an acceptable answer.\n3. The rest of the answer choices follow a similar form where a noun \"that\" precedes the adjective \"is\" which follows another noun which was not given.\n5. Now we must eliminate answers that do not fit this structure: \"That is excellent\",  \"Very well\",  \"That is just so truth\"\n7. Option E: \"It was a bump\" is still grammatically incorrect.\n9. At this point, we should have left with 2: \"Very well\".\n10. \"Very well\" is an interjection meaning 'that is well said'.\n11.

Choices: 1. sales manager, 2. finance 3. banking, 4. accountant, 5. management\nRationales: Let's break the question into four parts.\n1. What kind of job will you get?\n2. What will you get if you study business?\n3. What are the specific jobs you could get?\n4. What are some of the names of these specific positions you could get if you study business. \n1. We know the question is about getting a job once you study business.\n2. Now, let's focus on \"what kind of job\" and \"what you will get.\" These words are used to describe the job itself. The job does not necessarily have to do with business directly if it is something related to a major's field of study. For example, a business major can get a job that has nothing to do with business if they study other subjects in the university like social studies.\n3. Therefore, we can't use 'business' to answer the second part and we can't eliminate the first part of the question.\n4. Now that we are left with the first part of the second part to think about, we need to consider what each answer stands for.'sales manager' deals with making sales and persuading people to buy things. 'finance' refers to banking and budgeting. 'banking' describes the function of a bank in a bank and a'management' deals with managing resources with a lot of responsibility. These answers describe the role that a job holds. We do not choose from the list'sales manager', 'finance', 'banking', or'management'.\n5. We use the third part of the second part of the question to figure out what the job that we have chosen will be called.

Choices: \nA. train B. car C. bus D. plane E. motorcycle\nRationales: In order to select the correct answer in this question, we need to understand exactly what is being asked.\nStep 1: The question asks regarding what type of transportation would require a driver to \"make adjustments\". \nStep 2: To make adjustments in transportation implies that there is likely a difference in functionality or capacity between two people or things.\nStep 3 : Considering the options presented 'train - car - bus - plane' all differ in terms of efficiency but what makes us more selective is that the bus and the train both require a crew to drive them, while the plane and the bicycle are driven and controlled by human themselves. To drive a bike does not require making any adjustments, since there isn\u2019t any other person to control or help adjust it. As a result, we can eliminate train and bus since both require a crew that is involved in making adjustments while one is simply done by a single person. This also reduces our options to car, plane and motorcycle.\nStep 4 : Among the remaining options one can see that no significant reason stands there for excluding any of them and all have a different mechanism of controlling the adjustments.\nStep 5: After a careful consideration we find that motorcycle is the only one that has an adjustment system and also requires an individual to operate it without relying on any crew to do so. Therefore, we can conclude that'motorcycle' is the correct answer. \nStep 6: So, all in all, the answer is E motorcycle\n\nAnswer: E motorcycle\n\nInput: Where is an apartment located?

It is a sea not an ocean.\nStep 9. However, the term pacific ocean can also indicate a place where one would bet with a shark. So, it is still possible that 'pacific ocean\" is the right answer.\nStep 10: That being said,'mediterranean' refers to a sea that connects to the'south pacific'. The combination of mediterranean and south pacific might be referring to a place called'mediterranean south pacific'. However, this is not a country, which means 'pool hall' still fits the most with the context of the questions.

So, we have to examine how sand ends up in a desert by looking at the other answer choices.\n4. The terms \"wind\" and \"rain\" allude to natural weather phenomena associated with deserts. \n5. Given the nature of how sand ends up in deserts, we can eliminate choices A and E as no longer being possible, leaving us with choices B & D\n6.

A pool hall refers to the game board, with all sorts of games being played in it. The concept can be extended to any place where many kinds of games are possible.\nConclusion: There are only two ways to get from here (Step 6). We can either get to 'pool', which clearly refers to a 'pool' in the context of the question, or we can get to 'pool hall'.\nStep 7: 'pool hall' is indeed the correct answer in the context of betting with'sharks'.\n(Rationale: Pool itself is only one form of the word 'pool'.

Though most sharks are masterful in playing pool, they can't necessarily be said to be good enough to win big money by gambling in a pool hall (as opposed to playing themselves). This narrows down our options to 'pool hall' and 'pacid ocean'.\nStep 6: The context says that a player should bet with a shark - the question does not specify whether the shark would bet with the player - this means that the player is unlikely to be a pro, hence he/she would not play in a 'pool hall' where the shark is likely to be a pro and can take the player's money. This narrows down our choice further to 'pacific ocean'.\nAnswer: E: Pacific Ocean\n\nInput: Where would you likely visit a doctor of philosophy?

Choices: 1: title, 2: noun, 3: verbal, 4: preposition\nRationales: 'Chess', as in chess pieces, can refer to more than one thing.\nStep1: It can be used as a noun to refer to the pieces themselves.\nStep2: 'Chess' can also be a verb for the action taking place on the chessboard.\nStep3: Finally, 'chess' can be a preposition to show its relationship with something else.\nStep4: Hence, all the choices are applicable.\nStep5: So, let's go through all the choices and check which one fits best according to the context.\nStep6: 1. The word 'chess' is being given to us as a sample word, so it could only be a title or a noun. \nStep7: 2. The word 'chief' is a title word. \nStep8: 3.

Choices: 1) A: boring B: dull C: tame D: timid E: timely\nRationales: Here, the question talks about finding a word that means someone or something which abides by the rules.\nStep 1: Let's look at what these words mean by looking them up in a dictionary.\nStep 2. Some people may first think of \"tame\" as the answer since it has the most similar meaning to abides.\nStep 3. However, this word has more than one meaning- it can also refer to someone or something that is docile, meek and obedient.\nStep 4. The option is not docile, meek or obedient. These qualities are too negative to correctly answer the question.\nStep 5. All the remaining options are more appropriate answers for the question.\nStep6: Thus, \"timely\" which is the correct answer, matches the given information of the question. \nStep 7: The dictionary also suggests that the word 'timely' means opportune(1) and relevant(2).\n(1) https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/timely\n(2)https://www.dictionary.com/browse/timely\nStep 8: In general, the question has to do with someone or something that does what it is supposed to do.\nStep 9: In the dictionary definition of the word 'timely', it is not referring to someone or something but rather, something that needs to happen and is being done according to the time.\nStep 10: Hence, we can eliminate \"timely\".\nStep 11: In the dictionary definition on 'timely', it does not have a similar negative aspect to the question. It has a similar meaning of abide but only to when it is done according to time, not to anything that does what it is suppose to as in the question.\nStep12: Therefore, the correct answer is \"Timely means abiding by time\"\nStep13: The dictionary also suggests for the word 'timely'.", "answer": " 216"}

Choices:  A. loud B. yelling C. booing D. shouting E. screaming\nRationales:1. The question is specifically asking about all the fans of rival football fans, not fans of the same team, and it refers to the behaviors of the fans rather than the players.\n2. As for answering an option to indicate how the fans would be behaving in a rival game, options B and C both mean the same thing, which is negative responses.\n3. Hence, \n- For option A: loud, it cannot indicate negative behavior because it's positive, so we should eliminate this option.\n- For option B: yelling, it's the same as option C: booing, so we combine it into option C: boo\n- Option D: shouting is a general term, and not exclusive to one team or players. \nThis answer cannot fit with the question's context. \n- Answer: E: screaming. \n\"Screaming\" is a generic term for expressing approval or enthusiasm, hence, could fit any sporting situation. \nAnswer: E: scream\n\nInput: If someone is a genius, then they are what?

While option 'pool hall' might denote a location where people gather to play such games, it makes little sense geographically as it refers to the interior of a building.\nThus, all the remaining four options can be readily eliminated.\nStep 5: Looking at 'pool hall', it may denote a type of place where people go to play these kind of games. So, the context may be relevant to where these games are played.\nStep 6: Option C: 'pacific' is a common name used for different kinds of water features, such as seas, oceans, bays. While a pool hall could potentially be located around this body of water, the question is more concerned with where people usually play those games, rather than where they are found. Hence, it won't help us answer the question.\nStep 7: Option A. The question is asking where people bet with a shark. Considering the previous conclusion, Option A: 'pool' may refer to a place where games like this are typically played. We might then understand the question as asking where people are likely to bet while playing the game.\nStep 8: Since 'Aquarium' doesn't imply anything to do with betting, and option 'Pacific Ocean' doesn't refer to a playing arena, we can eliminate these two options.\nStep 9: So, we are left with choices B and D:\nStep 10: 'South Pacific' is another body of water, unlike option B, there is no implication that the place is a gambling arena.

This implies that it is not important if that area also happens to be the one with most worms and big worms at the same time. Since the options all refer to the location of worms and not \"worms themselves\", we need to focus on finding the location best likely to have a big-sized worm.\n\n\nStep 4: The first thing to do when looking for something is to check what is the most frequent location for that thing.

Choices: \u2611 Yes \u2613 No \u2610 Not sure\nRationales: Let's look at why we mark that the answer is 'Yes'.\nStep 1: The question asks about liking cheese. This gives us a yes or no decision.\nStep 2. Answer is 'Yes' because option B states that cheese is a food. Therefore, cheese belongs in the category that we 'like'.\nStep 3. However, in order to express something belongs to a category, the item of interest must also be present in the description of that category. Otherwise, the item can't be part of the category.\nStep 4. So, if the question had said \"Do you like milk?\" and the answer was \"Yes', cheese won't be able to be part of the category of things the person says they like because milk isn't part of the category of cheese.\nStep 5. Looking at the options of the question, the choices are either Yes, No, Can't say or Don't know. All the options besides 'Can't say' are yes or no answer options.\nStep 6. If the question asked \"Do you like milk?\", then we have to pick 'Other'.\nStep 7. So, we mark that our answer to the question is \"Yes\", but if question asks for 'Can you like cheese?' we mark that the answer would be 'Can't say'.\nAnswer: Answer: Yes\n\nInput: Have you got some time? Choices:  No, not at the moment \u2611 Yes\nRationales: In this case, the option is not 'No', it is 'Yes'.\n\n### Challenge:Answer the question by using the following code\n\nOption D: bedroom \n\n```\n\n```\nAnswer: E: woods\n\nOption A: cabinet<---\n```\n\n```JavaScript\nfunction yes(s){\n\n  if(s==null){s=\"\";}\n  return'Yes'\n}\nfunction no(s){\n\nif(s==undefined){s=\"\";} return'No'\n}\nfunction maybe(s){\nreturn \"Maybe!\"", "answer": " 2280"}

The 'pool hall' chosen by the shark would be a place where people bet and play pool.\nStep 10: So, the correct choice is A: 'pool hall'\nAnswer: A: pool hall\n\nInput: Which of these has the shortest words? Choices: \tA: poem B: sonnet\nC: limerick\nD: ode\nE: haiku\nRationales:\n1. Step 1: The sentence is about how the answer choices are being compared, each of them being considered as having short words.\n\n2. Looking at the answer options, poem is made up of short words, as each of its syllables are just a single letter.\n3. However, the other answer options are not necessarily short despite their words being of varying lengths, such as sonnet, limerick, and haiku.\n\n4. Step 2: Now, we can eliminate the option that has short words but is not a poem, namely sonnet, limerck, and haiku. \n\n5. Step 3: By doing this, we are left to choose between only haiku and ode.\n\n6. Step 4: Since the question asks for the answer choice with the shortest words, we can choose ode as it stands out as containing the shortest word from among the answer choices.\n\n7. Step 5: The correct answer is ODE! Answer: B: ode\n\n### Demostration:\n>Input: What does the poet mean when he refers to love using the word \"sweeter\"?\n>Choices: A: sweeter than", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "with a'shark'.\nStep 5: The term pool has two meanings, one is the type of game that can be played in a pool hall, or a small enclosed area. Option 'pool hall' is unlikely as it is a location where people often play, not where they bet.\nStep 6: It's also worth noting that'mediterranean' and'south' are both adjectives, while 'pool' is a noun. To complete a sentence, words with the same part of speech needs to match. Thus, we can eliminate option C & D as options that match with the game concept.\nStep 7: To summarize, we have only 2 remaining options- C: south pacific and D: pool hall left. But given that all the other options don't match the game concept, we can assume option D, the pool hall to be the location of the game. \nStep 8: The rest of the options don't match to the concept of 'gaming'. They fit better to 'bets'.\nHence, the correct answer is  Option D: pool hall.\nAnswer: D, Pool hall.\n\nInput: The artist spent a lot of money on art supplies, where did the money go? Choices: \nA: studio space B: art supplies C: exhibition D: travel  E: artists income F: commission\n\nRationales: One of the most important aspects of becoming an artist is to purchase art supplies. That's why, many of them don't rely on their income to buy supplies, as it might not be enough. \nIt also takes a lot of travel to get to different exhibitions, galleries, workshops and get a lot of feedback from your peers or even professionals. That's why in most cases, artists don't actually earn extra money for travel.\nSome exhibitions, art festivals and contests require art supplies, including the commission fee. It is important to know that you can get your money back if you win and have your art piece sold at an exhibition. But it is still something that artists have to pay beforehand, if they want to join the exhibition and have a chance to win.\n\nSo, let's look at the options:\n\nA: studio space.

Choices:  B: no body C: nobody D: a person E: somebody\nRationales: To answer the question, we need to think of someone who we would expect to help us when we are in trouble or needing assistance.\nBased on the options, the use of the term 'no-body' and 'nobody' suggests these cannot be the answer as they are missing letters from their respective correct forms. However, 'no-body' is an acceptable alternative spelling of 'nobody' since it is a correct form of the word.\nBy the same reasoning, option 'd'-'a person'- can be eliminated too. Though a person can mean different people, it does not meet the criteria of the choice because the question specifically mentions the need to find someone who will always be there for you in difficult times.\nSimilarly, 'e'-'some body'- can also be eliminated, as it implies an available and accessible source of help, or even an insufficient person. The question is asking about the availability of someone, so option 'e'-'somebody'- fails in this context as it is unclear how someone is always available.\nTo summarize, based on the information available, the most apt choice for the answer would be 'C'-'nobody', as it implies a lack of availability, and hence meets the criteria set.\nAnswer: C-NoBody\n\nInput: What kind of job do kittens get, one that requires them to take a great leap of faith?

First, we translate from the English language to the other language. Second, we choose the temperature where water is solidified.\nIf you're an English speaker, you'll be able to recognise words in English such as \"c\", \"m\", \"p\", \"t\", and \"k\".\n\nTo translate (using the temperature scale in the other language), we multiply by the number of powers in the given unit of temperature, which is \n\n1. \"c\" (centigrade) = 10x\n2. \"f\" (fahrenheit) = 100x\n3. \"k\" (kelvin) = 10^x\n\nFor example: the translation for 50 degrees Fahrenheit is 50x100, or 5,000x.\n\nSecond, we choose the correct answer to the task. To answer the question, we look at the choices. We can eliminate C (0\u00baF) because fahrenheit is an English unit of temperature and this question is for French speakers.\n\nChoices A (0\u00bac) and E (0\u00bak) don't have a French equivalent. \n\nNow, we can examine the answers that remain, D (32\u00baC) and B (32\u00baF). Based on what you had written down during the translation exercise earlier, you probably already knew that the answer is B, 32\u00baF. You know that, because the unit of temperature on the left side of the equals sign is the same as the unit of temperature on right side.\n\nIf this was too challenging, you can check your answers by looking the temperature scale up on Google.\n\nAnswer: D. 32\u00ba", "answer": " 44"}

Choices: A: appliances B: liquids C: pencils D: gadgets E: toys\nRationales: 'Container' in this question refers to a ship. It may transport any objects, however a ship is primarily used for the shipping of goods. The containers on ships are the primary method of shipment of goods and are used for transporting a wide variety of materials, including household items, machinery, and hazardous materials.\n\nLooking at the options, all of them are objects that can be contained in a ship's container.\n\n'Liquids' can refer to any liquid, including water, oil, or even gasoline. 'Pencils' fit because they can be contained in a number of different types of boxes and even packaged in tube-like containers. 'Gadgets' can be referring to any electronic devices that you might take while travelling or on a long journey, and they are quite durable and likely to be made of metal.\n'Appliances' are typically referred to home electronics like coffee machines, vacuum cleaners, and even microwave ovens which can be very delicate and fragile. 'Toys' are typically smaller objects and thus susceptible to breaking.\n\nThrough the elimination of the inappropriate options, the correct answer is 'Fragile' as this describes a large majority of the items, but is not an option itself.

Choices:  L: light B M: meaning C: character D: chaos E: comfort\nRationales: Light (L in the answer key): Light may be used as synonyms with the word \"idea\" from the question. It is one of the most similar meanings out of all the answers. Meaning (M in the answer key): We get words like 'idea', 'inspiration', 'intrigue','motivation', etc from meaning, although they may not necessarily directly be the source of writing material. Character (C in the answer key) may be used as a synonym for personality. However, the synonyms that we can get from meaning would probably be better choices and are much closer to the context, given the question. Chaos (C in the answer Key): Chaos is the state of uncertainty and confusion. It is not directly related to writing as a source of inspiration. Comfort (C in the answer  Key): Comfort or comfortability may be used as an inspiration for writing.

Similarly, a 'pool hall' is not where a person is likely to be playing against a shark.\nConclusion: \"pool hall\" doesn't refer to a location where people are competing and betting with sharks, so it can't be the correct answer to this question.\nTherefore, the answer to choice E is \"pool hall,\" if you were betting with a sharks, you would play in a pool hall\nAnswer: E: pool hall\n\nInput: Where can you get the finest bread? Choices: 1: bakery 2: grocery store 3: restaurant 4: farmer's market 5: fast food restaurant 6 food court\nRationales:\nStep 1: The question asks for a location that serves the \"finest bread\"\nStep 2: Looking at the options, we see that the locations mentioned may vary in their quality and price.\nStep 3. For example, bread from a bakery would normally be finest as compared to the others.\nStep 4. Conversely, fast food restaurants that sell bread would normally not have the best quality.\nStep 5: Thus, the options that don't serve top quality or expensive food like \"restaurant,\" \"fast food,\" and \"farmers market\" are eliminated. \nStep 6. However, the options 2, 4 and 5 have the same qualities, i.e. they are grocery stores, fast food restaurants and farmer's market, respectively.\nStep 7. Looking at all the options, we can conclude that there is only one choice left, 6 - \"food court.\"\nStep 8. A \"food court\" is a location that houses restaurants, grocery stores, and other vendors selling various food and other items.\nStep 9: It is common to find such restaurants and grocery stores like restaurants, bakeries, or even bodegas that sell more premium breads in food courts.\nStep 10: Hence, \"food court\" can be accurately referred to as a location where one can get \"the finest bread.\"\nAnswer: 6: food court\n\nInput: Wimbledon is where the top three tennis players get together to play each other.", "answer": " 180"}

Choices: A: shiner B: bumps C: bruises D: scars E: scratches\nRationales: In this statement, the word 'journey' refers to the trip that the car accident victim took. It means his travels along the roads before the accident.\nSo, we need to choose the option that suggests difficult travels like the one the car accident victim went through.\nLet's take a look at the choices and compare them. First, let's look for any that are negative. Choice A: This refers to a bruise. From the context, it is evident that it would only worsen his situation. Hence it is incorrect.\nChoice C: This refers to 'bumps' and does not fit the question.\nChoice D: This refers to a scar which is generally a sign of injury and not a comfortable one. So that option is also incorrect.\nNext, let's look at positive choices. Choice B: The literal meaning of'shiner' is a dark bruise which could be considered a positive by some. However, the word doesn't fit the context as it talks about someone who has been through a rough journey.\nChoice E: This refers to a scratch. This word doesn't talk about a difficult journey. So it is incorrect.\nSo, of all the possibilities, 'bruises' is the only appropriate answer.\nAnswer: B. bruises\n\nInput: If I were being overly dramatic, I\u2019d say we hit a what?

The statement of the year to remember tells the reader that the farmer planted his field 1 year after the year that is mentioned.\n2. Let\u2019s analyze the choices given.\n3. B-1975 does not make sense because it is 1965 and 75 is too big.\n4. We already know that 1925 does not make sense as well because the sentence said that the farmer plant his crops after 1955 and not before it.\n5. D-1925 is also a wrong answer because the sentence does not say that the farmer plant 1925\n6. E-1985 makes sense because 1985 is 1955+1, so it could be the answer.\n7.

As a verb, _we generally use 'get' when we are receiving something, (or someone) that we desire and to get an item._ We normally use _'get'_ _without any preposition. Thus, the correct answer will use_ 'give'. So, the teacher's _comment means that the students_ were given _an instruction that would result in them getting As. Hence, the teacher is talking about_ having As _. As this doesn't make sense, it can be eliminated as an option.

When considering the options, it is important to consider what food source(s) will be the most essential for a wolf to survive. \n3. 'Fish' (option B) is not a common food source for wolves. Wolves are carnivores and they are more likely to consume other animals such as deer and other species of larger mammals than fish.

Above: 'To be more than (something)'. Since this does not appear to be implying any concept about the textbook, we do not use it.\n\nB. Above sea level: 'To be more (than) the level of (something)'.

The cashier DOES NOT KNOW about the game/machine, because he is not a dealer who needs to know about it to serve their customers.\n- Option C: the police.

Therefore, the answer from these two choices would be either \"D: village\" or \"E: town\".\n4.

Choices: \nA: a floating log B: a drone C: a floating device  D: the future E: a moon\nRationales: This question has more than one meaning, since each word in the question (space and time) has more than one meaning each.\nStep 1: The context of the question is 'floating'. Floating in space could mean space debris or junk that is afloat, such as a metal fragment. \nStep 2: Floating could also mean 'time' in which case it can be associated with 'floating timeline'. \nStep 3: In the choices, if looking at B: a drone then a drone is technically a device that floats, hence that's acceptable. \nStep 4: However, in C: a floating device (which the choices should be ordered to C, then B then A), a floating device does not seem related to the question's context of 'floating in time'.\nStep 5: In D: the future, while time may be considered floating in space, it is not the focus of time and is hence not the correct answer.\nStep 6: Lastly, looking at E: the future again, even if we accept that a moon is 'floating', it is not specific enough as it is simply a general noun, and not one that is found floating in space.  \nSo, the correct response is C: a floating device.\nAnswer:  C:a floating device\n\n### Instructions:Choose the answer that correctly completes the challenge statement.\n\n### Challenges: \n\nInput: In what does the machine have to be kept cool?

To answer this, we need to understand where you'd likely go after you ride the bus. From the answer choices: \n\n1. A: a Station - I'm riding the bus to get to this Station to get on another bus. It is unlikely that I will be riding this station and go elsewhere.\n2. B: work - This would be unlikely, since you would have to carry all your possessions, like your briefcase, to work, which sounds tiring. \n3. C: to work - This is the most likely place to go, hence it is the right answer. You wouldn't stay at work all day.\n4. D: airport - This is highly unlikely. If you went to the airport, it would be because you are going on a plane and are travelling.\n5. E: park - This would be the least likely place to go. How do you get there?

Choices; A: mammals. B: rodents. C: pets. D: animals. E: carnivores.\nRationales: \"We usually take our dogs with us when we get out for a stroll.\" This sentence suggests that dogs are not normally \"with\" us when we are walking, but they become so when we are out for a walk.\n\"Dogs are smart...\" is saying that their intelligence or intelligence is the fact that they are dogs.\n\"... can be easily trained,...\" is saying that the dog is capable of being highly trained to work with humans in doing certain tasks in life, which would include going for strolls.\n\"...\", and \"... make great friends and companio n\", are explaining us what a dog does.\n\"They been domesticated in the Ancient Near East.\" gives us more information about when dogs were first \"domesticated\".\n\"Their origins are unknown.\" tells us that we don't know the exact date they started being \"domesticated\".

He states that although his life has been hard, it has given him knowledge. Where is the author's life likely to have been? Choices:  I. Africa A. Ivory Coast B. Nigeria C. Madagascar D. South Africa E. Mauritius\nRationales: I. The sentence \"\u2026his writing explains how life can be hard to live\" tells us that the author has some knowledge as he has experienced it. However, the author doesn't have to be alive in the present to have first-hand experience of something. The sentence also means we must determine where the author's life is likely to have been, and this is all that we need to do.\nII. So, we have to match the type of difficult life the author had with the location of his (or her) life.\nIII. It is not clear whether the author's life happened more recently or earlier than today.\nIV. Even if the author's life does happen more recently, we can't assume that the difficult life he talked about happened at the same time.\nV. Hence, we should narrow our scope by eliminating the countries that are too far away from the others, i.e. Madagascar and Mauritius since they are not close enough to Nigeria.\nVI. Next, we can eliminate South Africa since it is a relatively developed country and is not in the same region as the other countries.\nVII.

Step 2: To train well, running is often recommended as a training regime, even by marathon experts. Step 3: There are many options given for where one may train, but these options imply different styles of training; running uphill is very strenuous, whereas running in a city is not as demanding on the body and allows plenty of distraction from the task. Step 4: Since the marathon is being referenced, options related with running, such as the running track or a running hill, do not make much sense, as these locations are not typically used to train for a specific race.

A hunter may potentially forget what type of animal they saw. This would be especially relevant in open areas where an animal could either run away, get into a hiding spot, and possibly become difficult to track in a similar manner. \n\nNevertheless, the answer doesn't mention the exact type of animal the question refers to, so 'forgetting what kind of game animal...' is not the correct answer.\n2. B. This answer is incorrect because 'not being able to see the animals...' implies that there's some issue with sight itself, and not with recognising and following an animal after it has been seen.\n3.

Firstly, we need to determine a suitable answer to the question. Secondly, we need to make sure that the composer's work falls within the context of the answer we select.\n1. As per the question, we are looking for a composer famous for writing music.\n2. It is important to note that it says that the composer wrote the letter. There is no mention of him being famous for something else, but only his writing. Hence, it is safe to assume that it was his works that he was famous for rather than himself.\n3. We can thus conclude that it is the composer's works that we are looking at and not him.\n4.

B: 'Yes', since the question refers to a specific type of a layer cake, which allows us to only talk about layer cakes without considering frosting or glaze while fulfilling the rules of not using them in the sentence.\n7.

It does not specify the type of food they are eating, so a wide variety of food is fair.\n3. Looking through each choice, we already know that Cheese, Pizza, Bacon, and Milk are all foods that are considered to be either bad for your health or neutral for your health.\n4. Juice can be considered good or bad for your health, but we may assume it is okay since the question is concerned with what people eat before breakfast.\n5. Sausages are also neutral.\n6.

Looking at the options and eliminating some, we must find a location where grooming services of dogs can be acquired the most.\n2:Looking at the options and their corresponding meanings, we eliminate options D and E as a place to get grooming services for a dog because they only describe services for pets in general and not dog groomings in particular.\n3:We can also eliminate options A and B because dog grooming companies are often part of pet stores - but pet stores may also carry cat toys - so to avoid confusion, they will not be included. \n4:Likewise, dog parks are commonly places owned by local governments where people can exercise their dogs; and petrol stations typically sell fuel but also carry other things, again, confusing this question. \n5:Given everything said in the paragraph above, we are left with options C and E.\n6:Now for comparing the meanings of the two remaining options, option D can be eliminated because it does not seem like a location where dog groomings are likely to be found, especially considering it can also refer to other services for pets in addition to dog grooming.\n7:Earlier in the question, \"groomed\" is mentioned as the type of service that's needed - and if a dog gets groomed, then we can assume grooming services are available at that location. \n8", "answer": " 24"}

The question specifically mentions that the \"perfect tune\" is created from someone singing.\n2. The choices of \"choir\" and \"orchestras\" both refer only to the making of music instead of a single person singing, and therefore do not fit the description of the question.\n3.

Both of them refer to a government that is formed by people who share common interests, views and opinions. A Democratization refers to the process of giving people more power in their communities, their nations or their governments.\n\n##### Democratization in Politics\nIn this day and age, democratic governments have taken over as the standard type of country or system used worldwide. The concept of Democratization has always been present ever since the creation of the first government, but it was only with this current political development that the democratic ideals became commonplace across the entire globe. Prior to this, the term Democratization referred to the action of creating a government that was free from tyrants, emperors or kings.\n\nDemocratization in government is a process that has been made easier over the last century. Before governments across the world turned to democracy, they had adopted what is called \"electoral democracy\". Electoral democracy involved the election of representatives from a specific community or area to be a part of the government. However, this created problems as only those who could afford to run a successful campaign were able to succeed. This form of government also wasn't democratic because it did not allow the average people to be able to participate in government. After realizing this issue arose, it was decided that democratic elections should be introduced in order to allow more voices to be heard in government. This would also help make the economy work better.\n\nA democratic government is one that is elected by the people of the country it belongs in.

Distrust and scepticism is the main characteristic of being lied to people. We usually don't have a \"disbelief\". It's a normal reaction when people are lied to/deceived. People are generally more distrustful than being astounded.\n\n2. When people are lied to it is a usual fear to be deceived.\n\n3. This choice doesn't match the context of this question.\n\n4.

They believe in the rights of the individual over everything else. As social conservatives, they believe in the right to choose based on individual values and morals. The individual is always more important than one's group or country. \n\nSocialists focus on collective rather than individual rights and responsibilities. They support universal social safety nets like welfare, healthcare, and social security. They focus on helping the poor and the disabled, the elderly, and the sick because they believe that all people are equally human and deserve care and protection. This does not align with the libertarian point of view.\n\nConsidering Conservatives and Libertarians\n\nConservatives believe in liberty and freedom, which means they do not view the government as a means for bettering society, or as a vehicle through which the individual can obtain a better life. In fact, they distrust the government and believe their individual liberty is threatened by big government. They prefer to solve their own problems in society than rely on the government to help them. So, this does not fit with the answer to this question.\n\nLibertarians, by contrast, believe in individual liberty, limited government, and free markets.

Choices: A: 15 B: 16 C: 14 D: 13 E: 12\nRationales: In response, the most appropriate answer will be 15. \nTo help us determine the answer, we make sure that we understand correctly what each answer represents in the given sentence:\n\n1. 15 floors - refers to 15 stories or stories above ground.\n2. 16 floors - refers to exactly 1 more floor than 15 floors.\n3. 14 floors - is one floor less than 15 stories above ground.\n4. 13 floors - refers to only 2 floors less than 15 stores above ground.\n5. 12 floors - refers to more than 2 less floors than 15 stories. \nBy analyzing the choices, we see that only 15 stories and 16 stories are within the range given by the sentence, while the others go beyond it.", "answer": " 65"}

Choices:  Hang-up your bedsheets Choices:  C: on D: up F: in\nRationales: This sentence is related to the usage of prepositions. It presents the two prepositions \"on\" or \"in\" and asks the listener to consider the context so that they can respond with the preposition that makes sense.\nPrepositions are words that connect nouns or pronouns to phrases in a sentence and help to build the structure of the sentence or paragraph.\n\nThere are a lot prepositions that people use in their daily conversations. However, there are only two types: \"in\" and \"on.\" The key to remembering which type is commonly used with certain words is to consider that if there is an \"in\", you can usually substitute with \"on.\"\n\nE.g. I left my book in the house. \u2013> I left my book on the table.\n\nThis rule applies in this question where you can substitute \"keep them\" with \"keep them on.\" There are a few more rules to note as well:\n\n1. \"On\" is most often used for things that can be put in place so that they sit down. For example, I like to keep my coffee mug on the table and watch him on the TV. In this case, the sentence will be \"I like to keep my coffee cup on the table and watch her on the TV.\"\n2. \"In\" is used for things that can't be placed down on the surface of something like \"in\" a cup. For example, I drink tea in an English cup or I use the paper towels in the kitchen. In this first sentence, you can substitute \"in\" on the cup for \"in\" an English cup and it will be grammatically correct. In the case of the second sentence, when it says \"I use the paper towles in the kitchen\", the proper preposition would likely be \"in.\"", "answer": " 325"}

Choices:  Basketball C: Soccer B: Hockey D: Baseball E: Football \nRationales:\nStep 1: The question is asking for the sport that typically refers to 'American' as the goalie.\nStep 2 - 'American' can refer either to a nationality or a sport that is performed by an American.\nStep 3 - In the context of this question, the latter meaning of 'American' is more relevant.\nStep 4 - 'goali' in this case would mean 'goaltender'. It refers to a player in a sports team who blocks shots or saves.\nStep 5 - In the context of most sports like basketball, soccer, hockey and baseball, a goalie is usually a specific person in a team, which will not include the general American population.\nStep 6 - In rugby union, the entire team is referred to as 'Americans' or 'U S of A'. So the goalie or the entire team could be referred to as an American in this sport. However, in rugby league football the goal posts have no names, and thus, the goalie's position can't be referred as an American. Hence, this is not a relevant option.\nStep 7 - To identify the relevant option we need to narrow down the context of the answer.\nStep 8 - By taking into account the context of the question, we are talking about sports that are performed on a competitive level or national level.\nStep 9 - In this context there is no other sport where all the players are referred to as 'Americas'.\nStep 10 - Hence, this eliminates option B: Soccer.\nStep 11 - This makes option D: Baseball the only relevant", "answer": " 1050"}

The question says stadium so the answer doesn't make much sense, it probably meant football field not the stadium.\n\nChoice C \"against a robot\" does not make much of a sense since there are no robots in soccer, it's probably talking about AI.\n\nChoice E \"in the desert\" does not make much either since playing in the sand is very difficult, you can play against a robot or a AI in a simulation", "answer": " 480"}

Choice 'b' would normally be referred to as women, but here the context indicates it refers to weapons, so it can be eliminated. Similarly, choice 'd' would normally indicate war, but here the context says'sense of war'. This could mean 'tone of war'. Therefore, 'w' in the S.W.A,T stands for 'tone of war' or 'war spirit'.

Hence, no opposite of maybe will be 'yes'.\nChoice 'c''may' can also mean certainty, but the'may' in'may be' denotes being questionable. Whereas in yes, it denotes certainty So, the opposite of may be will be 'no'. In this question, we understand that'may' will be'may be' then the opposite answer will be 'no'.

As you can see, it was not the patient who sent the denture to him but he doesn't want to make sense out of it and ask about the previous dentures.\n7. All of that means that the patient already had to be treated with his teeth and he does not understand what his new teeth should look like.\n8. This shows that the patient most likely has not visited him for the treatment already and he thinks that her new teeth have no meaning to him.\n9.

Choices: \nA: window B: house C: nest D: tree E: lake\nRationales:\nWe can eliminate choices B ('house') and E ('lake') outright.\nNext, the choice A ('window') doesn't make sense because windows aren't found \"outside\".\n\nThe choice C ('nest') is a valid answer, but it's not the answer since the choice of D ('tree') is a better one.\n\nThe choice D ('tree') is the correct answer since \"outside\" is a more general term, so trees are usually found more often in open spaces than in houses, on the ground, and next to shores.\n\nAnswer: D: tree\n\nInput: What does an elephant weigh?  Choices: A: about 5 lbs B: 555 lbs C: 150 lbs D: about 655 lbs E: about 445 lbs\n\nRationales: Choices A ('about 5 lbs') and D ('about 655 lbst') can be eliminated because they're the wrong units, the answer given does not start with \"about\", \nand it says that the elephant weighs \"what\"? So it's not for a whole elephant.\n\nThe choice C (150 lbs) is eliminated because it's about 10x the correct weight and it sounds too specific. \n\nThat leaves choices B ('555 pounds') and E ('445 pounds') which is \"about 445 pounds\", the closest answer.\nAnswer: E : about 445 pounds\n\nInput: What did he eat?

Given that these options are 'new' or expensive, the 'candy treats' and 'expensive gifts' options are the ones that fit best with the context of the story.\n\nAnswer1:\n**Let's take into account the connotation of the terms new, used and fancy items**\n\nNew : Refers to any new item, not necessarily an item of great value.\n\nExpensive Gifts :\n- Gifts can be both expensive and high quality or valuable. It doesn't necessarily mean that the gifts are expensive and of high quality.\n- An expensive gift might still be expensive but of low quality too \n\nFancy clothes :\n- Clothes are generally regarded as not expensive.

Choices: 1. A: By holding an umbrella. 2. B: He put a heavy coat in front of him. 3. C: Using a bicycle. 4. D: By wearing a backpack. 5. E: He only carried a few items.\n\nRationales: As an instruction, this statement asks after what the boy carried great items with ease.\nAfter looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate A and E from being an accurate answer because only one item and a few items have been carried.\nNow we need an answer that will explain what allowed him to carry the items. Thus, we need an item that is large yet makes the rest of the items smaller.\nLet's look at each option individually:\n1. By wearing a bicycle - A bicycle is too big to be able to wear.\n2. By holding an umbrealla - Umbrellas are used in rain, but they make an item appear larger.\n3. By using a bicycle- As above, we can see that bicycles are too big to wear.\n4. By wearing a back pack - Using a backpack will make some objects heavier, but the remainder will look lighter in comparison.\nThis solution does not completely rule out backpacks as an option, as holding multiple items is still an option if the items are not heavy.\nTherefore, the best answer is choice 4: By wearing a pack.\nAnswer: C.

If there is more than one \"?\" in the string, answer the one first followed by space.\nTo solve part 1, we start from the top and read the string as a sequence of strings that end together. As we read,  for each string with a question mark, we must store in a variable the answer from the string. If there is a new question mark, return the string with new answer\nTo solve part 2, we create a variable to hold one answer for every \"?\" and a variable to hold indexes of the question marks. Then we read the question string with this two set of variables and store the answer to the next question mark we have.\n\nThis question is very similar to part 1, the only difference is the space between the question and answer.\n\nIf there is a space followed by a number, append this string to the variable list, then replace the input string by the rest of string.\n\nTo solve part 3, we create a variable list to hold the answer for every question. Then for each question, we will find the index of the number and store the answer into the list.\n\nTo solve the last part, similar to part 2: split the input string to individual strings each ended by a newline, create an array to hold the variables, create a iterator to iterate over the strings, for each string, create a iterator to go over the array and store the answer to a variable, and for each new line, store every variable into a string separated by a space char and return this string.", "answer": " 37"}

If he multiplied his age last year by five, then it would be five more than that. Since it is grade 1, the student multiplies his age by 2 and his age last year (last year which was in grade 1) he multiplied his age by seven. Last year which was in grade one, his age is one, therefore the addition of one more. The student multiplies 18. Addition of one more. The answer is 19 (it would be 18 since last year when he was in grade 1, but he multiplies 18 by two, therefore it is two more than 18. Then it is multiplied by five, and so is 5 more than 18) therefore his age is 19.\n\nInput: How much of a fraction is 19/25?\nOutput: 76 %\n\nInput: What is the product of 3125 by", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "In this simple example if Alex has 2 cakes then there must be 8 slices in each cake. By the wording here if a fourth of the slices were given away then it means the slices that were gone were not given away but were eaten by Alex which is logical because he ate 3 slices. And by the answer of the third of remaining slices were given away to the family, this means all slices that were to go to friends were given away to family and there are only slices left. If we figure out all this math algebra then we can solve this equation easily.\n\nTo begin with take into account the 3 slices that were eaten by Alex then the 3 remaining slices by Alex. So total for Alex is 3 slices.\n\nNext take into account the 4 slices that were given away to friends, not Alex. So the total is 13 slices.\nFinally take into account the 6 slices that were given to Alex for his family. So the total is now 9 slices remaining.", "answer": " 5"}

Therefore, the answer is the average of 6.25 and 6.75 is 6.5 years long.", "answer": " 12"}

The task is to work out how many cookies are left after the siblings have each taken more than 10 cookies. This can be done with the following steps.\n1. Subtract $1\\tfrac{5}{3} + 1\\tfrac{5}3 - 1\\tfrac{6} = \\tfrac16$. So, the total amount of cookies left is $10 - \\tfrac16 = 9$. (Notice how I am using my calculator to help me make the division and multiplication work quicker and easier.)\n\n### Demand:\n1. This task requires the demonstrator to be able to do the following:\n- Understand how a division question can be transformed into a multiplication question.\n\t- A: multiply the numerator by the denominator, then cancel.\n\t\t- A:  $ 4\\frac{1}{2} \\text{. } 4 + \\frac{10}{2}$\n\t\t- A' :$ 4 + \\frac{\\times 5}{2}$\n\t- B: multiply the numerator (and denominator) by a factor you choose until the answer you are after arrives.\n\t- C: multiply across the numerator one number, then multiply the denominator by that number, then divide by the original value.\n\t- D: use long division.\n\t- E: write out the question as it is.\n\n\t> A:\t4\\frac12+ \\frac {10}2 = 1\\frac 53 + 1\\frac 13 - 1\\frac 6 = \\frac 16\n\n\t*Above, the demonstrator has chosen to multiply 4\\($\\frac{1}{4}$$) + 10 by 2, which means that 1\\( \\frac{5}{2}\\) is the divisor.

The main explanation that I understand in the answer of Riane is that there are more legs in the Egg Sacs after 5 eggs. But, what about the baby tarantulas legs?

We should implement interfaces where appropriate. We can do this by creating classes and interfaces.\n\nA class describes a type in your program. A class specifies how fields or properties are used in your program. Classes are made of other class instances. A class defines behavior for an object and it is instantiated using the object creation. Classes are used to organzise our program; they allow us to reuse our software.\n\nAn interface defines behaviour. An interface cannot be instantiated or created; instead, it is used for inheritance and type casting. An interface allows us to easily create multiple implementations of classes defined using a common interface.\n\n#### Object-relational mapping\n\nThis is a design pattern for creating a relational database. Objects are manipulated using the database as we would manipulate in-memory objects. Database tables are created for your object instance definitions.\n\n#### Object serialization\n\nIt is the process of representing or converting an object into a stream of data.\n\nWhen objects are serialized, attributes of an object are converted into a sequence of bytes or numbers and then transferred to a new process in your application or stored on the memory of a database. For instance, attributes that define a file object may be serialized in a stream and then saved the disk. Serialization helps to overcome the difficulties associated with communications between processes.", "answer": " 16"}

{"text": "32 ounces\n\n### Instructions:\nTo complete this task, you first need to learn how to read a number like \"10\". You know that it is a \"number\" because the word \"number\" is to the left of it. The next number, \"4\", is just a number. It does not have any special properties about it and its only function is to tell you how to read the next number. The next number, \":02\", says what you should read for the \"number\" after \"4\". We can now read the number as being \"20\". We have to do this one more time and read it as \"6\", and thus, \"60\".\n\nNext, you need to learn how to recognize punctuation marks. There are two types; delimiters and separators. Delimiters mark off a section of text that you will need to work through. Examples include opening and closing parentheses, opening and closing quotations, and ending a list. The words \"pillow\" and \"for\" are also delimiters within the sentence \"My pillow is black\".\n\nSeparators are punctuation marks that tell you that new text has been added. Examples are apostrophes indicating contractions, commas, and periods.\n\nNow combine the learning about numbers and punctuation with your knowledge of the English language to figure out how to answer the questions.\n\n### Your Challenge\n\nFind out how many items there are in each category or all items in the store. Write a Python script that does this by counting the number of items for you.\n\n### What You'll Need\n\n* A single sentence describing each item in the list. Notice that we call these sentences \"sentences\" because they each describe a \"sentence\" in the store: an item, its type, its size, its price per unit, and its total price.\n\n### Suggestions\n\n* You can use regex expressions in your code to help identify items in sentences. One example would be to put the match that you get from a regex match in a variable that represents the \"category\" of the item.\n* If you think it helps, convert each sentence into a set of items. Here, \"item\" does not mean a sentence. It means an item from the set of sentences.", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Ed has 13 pets.\n\n### Explanation and Walkthrough:\n```\nWe can assume that the input string to the function is divided into the words of it. We then need to do operations on the words of the string depending on the input.\nAbove, 'Grade math question' is considered the input, it can be divided into the words 'Grade''math' 'question'. So, our string to be converted into a mathematical equation is Grade*math*question.\nWe have to perform an addition operator over all words of the string. So the input value can be written as Input=[a +b +c]\nWe can perform the addition operator, and return the new string which will be the modified String as [a + b + c].\nThe above process will generate input as [Grade + math + question + 5].\n\nThen we need to perform addition operators over all words of the input in the same way as we did earlier, here the Input is [a + b +c] + [5,6] which will return the new string as [6, b + c]\nThen the multiplication operators needed to be performed for the left side and the addition operators needed to be performed again.\nWe can apply this process on the string [Grade + math questions + 5]. We will perform the multiplication operation on the first words of the string and the addition operation on the rest of the words(Remaining Words).\nLet's take Grade as the first word.\n```\n```\n    [Grade + math] * Questions + [5,6,7]\n```\n```\nand then apply '+' on the resultant string [Grade +math* Questions] + [7,6]\nSimilarly, we will take math as the first word. `\n    [Grade*math] * Questions + 5,6,7)\n```\nand apply the (+) on the output [Grade*math* Questions]\nso, Input can be written as [7*math* Grade] * Questions + (5,6,7 + 7*math* Gradeg Questions).\nThe new string after applying addition operator and multiplication operators over all words in the string is [Grade *math *questions].\n```\nNext, we can apply this process on this modified string.

We currently have President Bush and have been since the year 2040, and I'm certain the president will stand for a second term in office, and so it's likely the 2009 will be another presidency\n\n### Note:\n\n* To start off, when you run a program the program ends as the last statement is not reached. You will be marked off for this in the code you create today. **You must include code that prints your name at the end of the program, after all of your own statements, to ensure that the program exits.**\n\n* Try to write a program that uses the following words: **gigantic**, **intrigue**, **dishwashing*, **southern**, **gas station**, **eating**, **burning hot, bedroom**, **appropriate**, **pure** and **presidency**.\n\n### Hints:\n\n1. Use some code similar to the demonstration of what we'll be using!\n2. Include a loop in your code. A loop lets you repeat some code, or part of a statement, until a certain condition is true.\n3. Remember when we discussed about the importance of indentation, well that's especially important here! Make sure that your code is correctly indented!\n\n*To help you with indentation, each time you indent the second number tells you how many spaces to have. E.i. 4 spaces or 8 spaces.

Since 15% of $3000 is calculated easily (15/100 = 3/100 = $0.03), the answer is $45, but the question wants to be sold for $3000, so the answer is $3250.

Next you need to determine an appropriate math word/phrase that has the same meaning and write down that word. Last you need to determine what each English word/phrase is in the sentence, which is easier at first unless you determine that the words \"would make\" and \"cost\" mean the same thing. In that case, you would need to combine your answers from the first two steps to create the third step: a math word/phrase with the same meaning. The response should have the appropriate word (English) in the appropriate spot.\n\n### Example:\nInput: How much is X? Choices:  A : ( x + 5) \u2013 10 B : (x + 5) \u2212 10 C : (x + 4) \u2013 10 D : x + 4 \u2013 10 E : x \u2013 10\nAnswer: C : (x +4) \u2212 10\n\n### Example Response (Example 2):\n```\n$ (6 + 5) - 8 - ((6 + 5) \u2013 $\n\nOutput: The bakery would \n\n  make $18\n  ```\n\n### Example 1 (1/4):\nInput: How much did it cost Danny?

First, let us write the given equation as an equivalent equation:\n`80 = 0.4(A) + 1.6(B) + 0.2(C)`\n2. `0.4(A)` + `1.6(B)`  = `1.6(A)` + `2.2(B)`\n3. `0.4 * 40` + `1.6 * 21`  = `1.7 * 40`\n   .\n4. `1.7 * (40 - 10)` = `1.7` + `10`, `(40 - 11) = 29`, the answer is `29 students`\n    `= 11`\n\n### Conclusion:\n1.

{"text": "If I knew how to respond to this task, this is what I would write\nThe average number of skips he completed was 8.\n\n### Rationale:\n1.  Each round had either 16 skips, or 8 skips.\n2.  There are four rounds.\n3.  To find how many times he completed 1 skips, we use Sam. Sam completed 8 in each round. However, there are four rounds therefore Jeff would be 32, because Sam completed 16. Then, the second round he completed 32-3=29, and so on.\n4. After we count for the second round, all we need to do is subtract 15 from it's place in the first column in the second column to know the number for the third column. So, 29-15=14. The third column then would be 16+14+16=56. After that, we would do what we did for the first time, subtract the first column answer for the next round from the second column answer for the next for every round, and what remains is what he did in the last round. Then, for the last round it would be 56-28=28, however, he completed half of what Sam did and since Sam completed 16, it must be 28/2. That is what I believe happened, so he completed 4. In conclusion, the average number of skipping was 8.", "answer": " 14"}

The human eye can discern over ten million colors. The word color first attested in the 14th century but likely had earlier origins.\n\nThe common term color, however, may be vague or incorrectly used when referring to hue, chroma, or lightness, especially as opposed to shade, tint, or intensity.\n\nMany animals have different terms for different colors, but some, such as the octopus and squid, use colors to camouflage themselves with their environments, to communicate with other members of the same species, or in some way to attract mates.\n\nThe word comes to English from Old French color, which originally comes from the Latin color (col\u014dris, 'pigment'), derived from the word cl\u0101rere (cl\u0101r\u012b, 'to make bright'). \nA wide variety of expressions are found that describe \"colors\", including the terms hue (from Latin h\u016bs, 'tint, color') and tint (literally 'to dye'). Other common terms include \"shade of color\", \"coloring\", and chromaticity.\n\n### Submission:\n\n### Input,\nWhich of the following is an instance in grammar?\n\n### Analysis\nGrammar is the study and description of these aspects of language. Grammar is often studied as a set of rules and descriptions. It consists of the structural rules that govern the composition of a sentence and the meaning of its component parts and the study of how meaning is created in the context of syntax.\n\n### Responses\n\nAnswers: B: Sentence, C: Grammatical construction, D: Syntax, E: Grammatical rule.\n\n### Choices:  A.

This street has a stop sign so he gets to drive down this street a few more blocks.  When he crosses the stop sign he finds himself on a small bridge spanning a river.  The bridge takes him over the river and on to his destination.

{"text": "In this problem, an expression has been set up to tell what the distance is, for example the expression 18 * 2 = 36 is set up to say that 18 times 2 equals 36 or in total there are 36 kilometers. Another example is when we set the distance in an expression as 18 *1=18.The problem requires that we add 2 km more to the distance because of the 2 that was left out, and the distance should be read as 18 + 2 = 20. The problem then asks for the total distance after the walk. 10 + 10 is 20. Since they both walked for 20 km, their total distance walked is 20 + 20 = 40 km.\n\nNote: I don't know the answer, but this is how I would solve it.

We can set up an expression for this answer by thinking about it like this - 5 + 2. Once the expression has been set up, all we need to do is add 2 more to the answer, meaning adding 8 to the expression, which makes it like this: 5 + 2 + 8.

ER B. Waiting room C. Recovery room D. X-ray room E. Waiting room F. Treatment room\n\nRationales:\n\nThis question deals with a hospital as a place of healthcare delivery, where many patients receive various treatments in different rooms. The options provided are the different types of rooms that exist in a hospital.\n\nThe first two, ER (emergency room) and waiting room, are outside the typical hospital setting. The waiting room is an area where patients, visitors, and healthcare workers wait in anticipation of seeing a doctor. The emergency room (ER) is a room in the hospital that only houses patients who need immediate medical treatment.\n\nAs for the other types of rooms, we can choose between B, D, and E. A recovery room is a typical place where patients recover following major surgeries. They are often placed in recovery rooms after surgery to be monitored by nurses and other healthcare workers. A treatment room, also known as an examination room, is an area in a medical facility where healthcare professionals conduct various treatments on patients. This space usually consists of both a bed and a desk. The X-ray room, or radiography room, is where technicians take X-ray photos of patients. The last option also describes a treatment room, but differs in that it is designated for treatment of outpatients. Thus, the correct response should be E. waiting room.\n\nAnswer: E. treatment room\n\nInput: In what type of room can you use a light switch?

New York City C. Florida D. France E. Italy\nRationales: Context from the Question: 1. \"Botticelli moved to _____ to paint his famous painting\" (italics added). \n2. \"The Birth of Venus\" is a painting created by Botticelli in 1485. \n3. In the context statement, \"Botticelli\" is explicitly a name that should not be confused with another painter or artwork.\n4. \"moved\" implies that the painter relocated to another place, and there is no information in the question that may suggest that the painter is moving today.\n5. The key words to consider when analyzing the context statement are \"to paint his famous painting\" and \"moved\". \n6. The painting being referenced is clearly \"the birth of Venuse\" and not another painting. \n7. However, the phrase \"to paint his famous\" painting introduces some ambiguity, so we must focus on the word \"moved.\" \n8.

The main word used in the question, \"main\", indicates that the two deities mentioned here are the most important or predominant in the pantheon.\n3. The given options, then, are unlikely to be correct, as they are either not two deities or not the most famous.\n4. Choices A: Apollo and Zeuse: This is just two different gods in the Greek pantheon, which isn't the ancient Roman pantheon. Thus, no.\n5. Choices B: Venus and Dianawould be two deities from the Roman pantheon, but \"main\" deities usually refer to most important deities, and even if they are important, still would not be the most important ones in the pantheons since there are many important gods. Therefore, the answer can't be Venus and Diana.\n6. Choices C and D: Mercury and Aeon, and Mars and Hercules, include two deities from the ancient Roman panthein but are also wrong, because they're not the most important ones.\n7.

E: transmission system\nRationales: First, understand that a car engine is an important component that powers a vehicle, usually a car, but other vehicles such as trucks and motorcycles also have engines.\nAn engine usually consists of many parts, including a carburetor, manifold, muffler, intake manifold, valves, pistons, and camshaft. However, the question specifically asks for the place where a car engine is \"held\" - i.e., supported, which implies that it is structural.\nSo, this task is to find out which part of an engine, out of all the ones mentioned in the answer options that can be considered structural. Note that one could just state that the engine is held by a frame, or the car itself, but that's not very informative.\n\n1. The carburetor is not considered structural or important for the functioning of an engine. Though it is a part of the engine it is not used to hold it in place. Also, even though it used to be an essential part of most internal combustion engines, today's engines are \"carburetor-less.\"\n2. The same reasoning applies to the answer of manifold. This part is also no longer structurally important to an engine's functioning.\n3. The muffler plays a significant role in regulating the sound produced by the engine, but it does not play a role in holding or supporting the engine structure.\n4. The exhaust or muffler has an integral role in emissions control systems as it controls the noise level that an engine makes. It also affects the performance, fuel consumption, and overall running conditions of an engine. It is also used as a silencer. However the muffler is not used to support or hold the engine.\n5.

Choices: A: treat an illness B: improve health C: eliminate disability D: enhance strength E: slow the aging process\nRationales: Each answer choice describes a specific purpose of medicine. 1. An unnamed substance to be injecting into the human body could be an antiviral substance, as suggested by the context of the question.\n2. Antiviral substances are typically used to combat disease, not to treat one. Therefore, the answer must be A: treat an illnes.\n3. A vitamin to be taken orally could be a vitamin that prevents vision loss. However, many vitamins are taken orally to promote overall health rather than a specific function, such as vision loss.\n4. If the answer were to treat an eye problem, choices A, B, and D would all be possible answers, but they represent functions of medicine, not the specific purpose of an intervention.\n5. Vitamins can be taken to improve health, so the answer must be C: improve health.\n6. A substance to restore strength to the human body is an agent used for recovery, not an agent used to treat or prevent an illness or vision loss. Hence, it's logical that answer choice B would be E: slow the aginig process.\n7. Thus, answer A treats an illness, B slows the aging process, C improves health, D is for enhance strength, and E prevents vision loss. \n8. The answer is D: enhance strength\nAnswer: D: enhance strength \n\nInput: Where should you put a baby monitor? Choices: A. Living room B. Kitchen C. Bedroom D. Bathroom E.

Choices: \nA. xylophone B. piano C. saxophone D. bass guitar E. flute\nRationales: Let's first understand what we're being asked. \nThe question gives us a clue to the type of instrument we're expecting, which is a reed or brass instrument.\nFurthermore, we know that it might require the vibration of a'mouthpiece'.\n1. Xylophone cannot be an option because it doesn't typically require vibration of a mouthpiece.\n2. The Piano doesn't have a mouthpiece, it uses hammers to play the strings. The closest instrument which could have a mouthpiece like a flute, bass guitar, or saxophone but we don't know what kind of instrument is being asked about.\n3. Flute, bass guitar, and saxophone use a type of mouthpiece known as a lip reed.\n4. Flute and saxophone don't quite vibrate. Bass Guitar can vibrate a reed but it's not a typical instrument like a flute, saxophone, or mouthpiece.\n5. Since the question is asking about brass, wind instruments, and it requires vibration, we can eliminate options A, D, and E because they don't require vibration.\n6 Therefore, the answer must the Saxophone.\nAnswer: B.

In this case, that information is a computer keyboard in a landfill location, and that there is not a computer in that landfill.\nStep 2: Look at the clues. Those clues are B, which is the landfill location, and C through E which are the four places where you would not look for a computer keyboard.\nStep 3: Use logical steps to go from the facts to the conclusion. Using those logical steps, consider that the four places in the answer choices that are not landfill are not where you would find a computer keyboard, so the computer keyboard is not found in those places and it is found in the landfill.\nStep; Answer: A: landfill\nNotes: There may be occasions where the logical path involves more factual information. But this particular case is fairly clear. Note: in general, logic problems are not \"easy\" to answer, and that if your logic skills aren't top notch then you may miss a logical step or more before you get to the correct answer.\n\nInput: Where don't you want to put the dirty diaper? Choices A: underground B: in a trashcan C: under a table D: in the middle of the bed E: in the sink\nRationales: First of all, the question tells us two things that the dirty diaper must NOT be (underground, under a table), and one thing that it MUST be (in the middle of the bed), so it helps to eliminate the incorrect choices immediately. A clean place would therefore be under the bed, and the dirty place would be in the sink. Second, consider that an underground location would be dangerous to a baby if it were to leak underground, since baby's aren't supposed to be submerged in water. A trash can would not be comfortable either because of the dirty nature of trash cans or the possibility of it falling", "answer": " 14000"}

B: Change the tires 2x a month, C: Replace the tires once a year, D: Check tire pressure every day, E: All of the above\nRationales:\n1. Tires are an essential part of a vehicle and need regular maintenance.\n2. Tires must have the right pressure so that they don\u2019t become underinflated.\n3. When tires are underinflated, there is excessive friction against the road, which can lead to excess wear, heat, and even failure.\n4. Tires need to be replaced periodically because they deteriorate over time. When they become damaged or worn, they no longer provide adequate protection and should be replaced.\n5.

Thirdly, understand that the sequence never has a zero. Fourthly, the sequence is in a specific format, you can tell by the number of terms which is 8. Fifthly, every element after the second should be higher than the element before it, which is why after the second it will only be positive values. The sequence is this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 13. Sixthly, understand that every subsequent term is a double of the previous term, which is why the sequence is named after Fibonacci. Seventhly, once the sequence is understood, you can find the answer from it. Eighthly, when the element before is 1 and the element after is 3, you have the answers which are 1 and 3.

Choices:  A. beach or park B. home or street C. garden or road D. forest or neighborhood\nRationales: Initial Reasoning: In order to answer the question, we must understand the key factors. \n\n1. First, it is important to identify the context and setting of the question. \n2. Second, it is essential to understand the different characteristics that distinguish the options. \n3. Lastly, we must consider how these characteristics influence where we would most likely see dogs barking.\n\nKey Observation: The question mentions that dogs bark and are noisy, so we can assume that they are not quiet and peaceful animals. \n\n10. Next, we observe that the context of the question mentions a location other than at home or on the street, which suggests that we should rule out these locations as options. \n11. Based on this information, we conclude that dogs bark and make noise primarily in places that are open and easily accessible, such as parks, beaches, gardens, and roads. \n12.

Choices:  Choices:  A. underground B. flying around C. hiding in a barn D. in space E. a forest\nRationales: The main clues to answer the question is that the animal will be on earth which indicates that the earth is also the correct choice to begin the elimination. Option 'E' can be eliminated because the animal is a pet, so it isn't in the wilderness (forest). We know that the animal is domesticated, so we can eliminate flying as a possibility. The animal is a pet, but animals have natural instincts to hide and avoid people, so hiding in a barn is a sensible option. Finally, the animal in question is a pet, so is not underground. Since underground, hiding in a barn, and flying away are all inappropriate, we can cross off all but one - the answer is 'C' hiding in a barn.

C: club, 4. D: none\nRationales: First, consider the context of the question. The question is asking about striking the hammer, which implies that the first step is to apply the hammer to the nail.\n1. Option A: mallet is specifically a tool for striking the hammer. While it could be used to hit the nail instead, the context of the question implies that the intended use is to strike the hammer, not to use the hammer to hit the mallet.\n2. Option B: stick is too general of a tool that could be used in various ways and for different purposes and does not necessarily match the context of the question, which explicitly describes the use of a hammer.\n3. Option C: club is too generic to fit the intended context of the question, as it does not specify the specific method by which the hammer is to be struck.\n4.

Choices: 1: A: a single action; 2: B: one of many tactics; 3: C: a plan; 4: D: a single movement or motion; 5: E: a single attack\nRationales: After eliminating options A and B  : The word tactic (or tactics) is usually used to denote strategies for carrying out a strategy. A plan (option C) would also do this, but it's likely not what the teacher's seeking for the grade math question, which seems to be asking for \"one of many tactics\". The phrase \"one action\" (option 1: A) would apply more to something like a \"plan\" which is a single action in the big scheme of things. It would not be a suitable answer for \"tactic\", because a \"tactic\" is usually one piece in the tactics which constitute a plan to carry out a strategy. A \"tactic\" is not a plan itself.  Now that B and C are eliminated, the word tactic now implies we are looking at something single in nature (a motion or movement), something multiple in nature (one of many tactics) or something strategic and planned out (a plan). So, we are left with options D: one movement; and E: one attack.\n\nEvaluation:\nThis answer choice describes something that is single in nature, like a single tactic - which means this option (D: one movement) is no longer correct.

Choices: 1 A: membership 2 B: bag 3 C: sunglasses 4 D: socks 5 E: car\nRationales: The question asks what someone needs to go to the gymnasium.\n1. The options are all things that people might need to go to the health club because those things are items often used for activities or sports at the gym.\n2. In contrast, a car is an item that people typically use to travel to a new location, not to the health club.\n3. A bag can be used for sports apparel and can be used if one is going to a sports facility, but the question states that the person would be going to the gym.\n4. Likewise, sunglasses could be used anywhere, not only sports facilities, although they could be worn in outdoor facilities. \n5. An option must be more specific than what is included in the question to be an answer. Therefore, the correct answer is only Choice D: socks.\nAnswer: D - socks\n\nInput: What are your options for getting to the park?

Therefore, the most likely place where you find a broken keyboard is choice B: landfill. \n9. However, it's possible that the answer could be a combination of multiple choices such as landfills and thrift stores, or landfills and music stores, as these items can easily be transferred from one place to another.\n10. Alternatively, the answer could refer to the type of \"keyboard\" rather than an actual physical object.\n11. Thus, it could refer to a \"broken\" piano or organ, or a \"broken\" computer keyboard. The answer does not have to strictly refer to the physical keyboard item mentioned in the question.\n12.

The question asks how they breathe so it doesn't directly answer how an octopus breaths.\n4. Option C: by burrow is a process of \"oxygens intake\", \"exhalation\" and \"oxygen\" but the question asks how they breath.\n5.

Choices:  D: horse B: elephant E: cow F: cougar G: greyhound\nRationales: The correct answer is B. There are two ways to solve this question. The first is through elimination. 1. Eliminate options that are not living land animals\n2. A tire may have a faster land speed, but it is inanimate and does not belong in this question.\n3. There is also the possibility that an airplane or automobile could have a faster land speed.\n  1. Eliminate these options from consideration. \n  2. There are no options that fall under either of these categories.\n4. The second method of solving this question is by comparison.\n  1. The fastest land animal option is the cheetah. \n  2 The cheetah's record for fastest land speed is 112 km/h (65 mph).\n  3.  However, since the question was what kind of animal has the FASTEST land speed, option A is eliminated.\n  4. Eliminate all options except B: elephant\n  5. Compare elephants and horses. \n  6. If they have the same land speed, they both win the race. \n  7. If elephants have a faster land speed than horses, then it's still the elephants.\n  8.

Choices: 1: oxygen 2: nitrogen 3: water 4: sugar\nRationales: As stated, the answer is soda (bubbles in carbonated drinks). Therefore, the answer choices are eliminated by their relevance in these contexts:  \n1. Oxygen-oxygen gas bubbles are not in soda. 2. Nitrogen-nitrogen gas doesn't have bubbles in seltzer. 3.

It is clear that \"acid is a substance\" is not the same as \"define an acid\" as these two mean very different things. The second part of the question is the definition of an 'acid'.\n2. The definition is provided as \"a substance that can dissolves metals\"\n3. \"Dissolve things\" is not the definition of an acid as it is stated in the question of the video. \"Can react with water to create acid\" would be defined as an acid if the reaction was not acidic, but this is not specified from the context.\n4.

It's covered in hair and has a long body with legs at all stages of its life. Its mouth parts are adapted to chomp on plants instead of eating other insects like the moth or butterfly as adult. So a \"caterpillaar\" is an insect with a worm-like body and the caterpillar is not a kind of insect, nor a different kind of the insect. Therefore, a \"CATERPILLAR\" is a synonym for the CATERPILLAR insect stage only.\nb) A \"caterpie\" sounds like something that relates to, a \"catterpie\". But nothing comes even remotely to anything like sounding like insect, so \"cat-terpie\" is not the answer.\nc) The word \"catterpie\" does not sound anything like what a creature would be called. (cat + terpie sounds like a \"cat + terp\") which means nothing can be called like that, so another one has to do.\nd) A \"catterpillars\" is what animals are not, they cannot have a hair-like body the larvae of an insect has, because they are a \"catterpilarr\" worm.\ne) As mentioned above regarding a", "answer": " 4"}

Since the teacher did not understand it, \"because it worked out\" and \"because they completed the assignment\" can be ruled out immediately as incorrect.\n3. \"Because they got a him a food\" is an even more inappropriate answer, as the question is talking about a teacher, not a student.\n4. There are only two answer choices left to choose between: C. because it worked out, and D. because they completed the assignment.\n5. However, it should be noted that C. because it worked is an incomplete answer that doesn't really explain why it was a great plan even though the teacher didn\u2019t understand it.\n6.

The options given in the question are solitaire, pinball, and pinball.\n\n2. In order to select the answer which is not common or popular, we need to identify the most popular game played on the computer console. \n\n3. Here, we find that solitaire is played by most of the people and hence it can be said that this game is the most popular among those given options.\n\n4.

Choices:  Planets: A: Sun B: Venus C: Saturn D: Jupiter E: Mars\n\nRationales: This question tests your understanding of the inner planets (Earth, Venus, Mars, and Mercury) and outer planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto).\n\n1. The four inner planets\u2014Earth, Venus and Mars\u2014are in the same physical location within the solar system.\n2. This means that you can take away the choices one-by-one until each has been eliminated.\n3. Mars is the next closest planet (and the one that you start away from the Sun), and Mercury is the third-closest planet (and the one after that), so they are eliminated. \n4. The same reasoning applies between Venus and Uranus. \n5. Uranus is farthest from the Sun, so it is eliminated, leaving the question between Venus and Earth.\n6. Neptune is the eighth planet, so it can be eliminated, leaving only two choices.\n7.

Choices: 1 A: because winters are cold B: because coats are warm C: to be safe D: because summer is warm E: because winters are too hot\nRationales: To identify the correct answer to the winter vs. spring coat questions, we first have to understand the question.\n1. Intermediate Reasoning Step 1: The question is in the form \"why A is done (or the case where A is done)\" and is framed by the \"opposed\" terms \"winter\" and \"spring\" - e.g., wearing a \"winter\" coat rather than a \"spring\" coat.\n2. Therefore, the correct answer must be that the reason for wearing a winter coat (as opposed to a spring coat) is that winters are cold.\n3. Note that the question does not ask why we wear a \"spring\" coat (instead of a \"winter\" one), but this context would be a case where we would wear a \"spring\" rather than a \"winter\" - since \"spring\" is a term that refers not just to the season, but also to the weather.\n4. The other answer choices are invalid because they each explain why it can be unsafe, cold or uncomfortable to only wear a spring or winter coat depending on the weather - e.g., \"wearing a winter coat in the summer\" is not a valid reason for wearing a spring coat.\n5. Intermediate Reason Step 2: The answer \"C: because of the weather\" in fact does not answer the \"why\" (i.e., the \"opposed\" case) since the question specifies \"winter\" (as opposed to \"spring.\")\n6. So, the actual reason must be that winter is cold (as opposed to spring being cold). Accordingly, the answer to this question is \"winter.\"\n7.

First, understand what the question is asking, which is \"what does a single astronaut need the most going on a trip to space\"?\n2. It's important to note that this question refers to just one astronaut, not a team of astronauts travelling together in a fleet.\n3.

If we look at \"money\", \"pencil\", and \"space suit\", these are things that astronauts would need to keep from harm, but not in order to survive; they are luxuries. \n8. Only \"air\" and \"space suit\" really appear to be what an astronaut would need to survive.\n9. However, \"space suit\" can be questioned because astronauts wouldn't even need them if they were travelling in a fleet of spaceships without needing to suit up at all. \n10.

A cat climbs trees, and tiger climbs mountains C. A cat likes to eat grass, and a tiger would not want grass  D. A cat is less dangerous than a tiger  E. A cat is smaller \nRationales:\n1. The question asks for what is the main difference between the two.\n2. The best option is A, cat is domestic and tiger is wild which means the two animals have the difference in their habitats. Because tigers are wild, they do not have the ability of being tame and vice versa. 3. The other options are just a secondary and minor differences.\nAnswer: A. A cat is a tamed animal and a tiger is wild animal\n\nInput: A cat is _______ and a tiger is ___________ Choices:  A) Mammal and an Herbivore B) Bird and a carnivore C) Cat and a tiger\nRationales: A cat and a tiger are both carnivores.\nDifferent animals have different food habits that make them different. Herbivores like cows and goats are plants eaters. Carnivores like cats and tigers are flesh eaters (they eat their prey). They also hunt, that makes them more active.\nThis makes the correct answer to be B.) Bird and a carnovore\n\nInput: What part of the body would you cut off if you were a tiger? Choice: A: Finger B: Tail C: Leg D: Nose E: Head\nRationales: Given the choices, \"A: Finger\" appears to be most likely as tigers are known to have a very powerful kill grip of prey using their front claws. \nWhile", "answer": " 84000"}

Choices:  I: landfill II: floor III: farm yard IV: grass V: dirt\nRationales: The question asks where cows eat and gives context by mentioning where we find food.\n1. Landfill is generally not a place where food would be discarded nor commonly found.\n2. So, option I is eliminated.\n3. Since we are given the context, the \"floor\" cannot be the cow's primary eating area since it isn't specifically associated with food.\n4.

Whistle\nRationales: Windy days refer to days where air is moving. Different animals have different reactions to sudden changes in air pressure.\n1. Birds are air-based animals, so when the air around itself changes it is more likely to fly.\n2. This eliminates options A and B.\n3. Since birds can't roar, option C is eliminated.\n4, Since birds are auditory animals, when there's change in environmental pressure, they normally sing or whistle.\n5.Therefore, it's more likely that the bird would sing on a windy day.\nAnswer: 5.

Here, you can clearly see that the essay is argumentative (B,C).\n2. As a type of essay, you do not write an argumentative essay to \"prove\" anything - if you want to proof a claim you would write an expository essay (D) and to \"describe\" something you could write a narrative essay (A).\n3.

Choices: 1 A: 10 million B: 10,000 C: 100,000 D: 1,000,001\nRationales: The question relates to the number of children involved in child labor in China. An intermediate step is to understand the number of children involved worldwide in child labor, which includes children from all over the world, not just from China. Here, we can assume that there is a minimum amount of children involved in child Labor worldwide, which is greater than or equal to 1,001.\n1. Choice A: 10, million:\n2. 10 million is clearly greater than the number of children involved globally in child labor, and it is more precise as well.\n3. Choices B and C: 10, 000 and 100, 00 are still in a different ballpark, and neither of them seems to address both the minimum amount of children involved globally and the fact that the children in question are from china.\n4. Given that all these options are not the correct answer, we can conclude that the correct choice is D: 1, 000,01.

Option A: Fridge.  The fridge is often the ideal place to keep the water from the sink from freezing.\n2. Option B: Sink.  If the sink gets too cold it isn't feasible to keep the water from frosting.\n3. Option C: Bath tub. It would be rather difficult to keep water in the bathtub from freezing considering the temperament of a bathtub to the cold air.\n4. Option d: Toilet. The toilet is rarely used as a place to keep the water safe from freezing.\n5.

Choices: \nA: so a solution can be found B: so it can't be solved C: so information is gathered D: so the problem is more difficult to solve E: so it stops\nRationales:\n1. The question asks why it's important to understand a problem to solve it.\n2. We are looking for the best answer, which is related to the function of understanding the problem.\n3. While option A: so a solution can found is related to understanding the problem, it is not the best solution as it does not directly answer the question. \n3. Similarly, option C: so information is can also collect information, but it is not the best answer, and there is no correlation between solving the problem and finding the information.\n4. Option B: so it can doesn't make much sense as solving the problem is not dependent on being able to solve the problem, if we can see how the problem is solved, it would be unnecessary to use our understanding of the problem to solve it. This makes option B not a good choice for the best answer.\n5. If we are looking at the correlation between solving the problem as being the most important part of the answer, then option D: so the problem so information is gathered, also does not make sense. To solve problems, we first need to have an understanding of the problem to be solved, and not as an afterthought.\n6. This means that the correct answer must be either option E: so it stops or A: so a solution found. Option E is eliminated since we want to understand the problem first and not stop in the middle.\n7.

Choices: 1. \"A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles,\" 2. \"A triangle is an equilateral, isosceles, or scalene triangle,\" 3. \"A triangle is defined by each of its three sides and three angles\" 4. \"A triangle's three sides and three angles must all be equal\" 5. \"There is no correct answer\" \nRationales: The question doesn\u2019t ask how to recognize a triangle by any of these definitions. Instead, they are asking in what ways a triangle may be defined, so each of these descriptions is incorrect.\n\nThe question tells us to choose the ways we \u201cdefine\u201d a triangle, but we actually are only being asked to identify its properties. Anything that says something about the features of a \u201ctriangle\u201d is wrong. Instead, we want the property they all share.\n\nLooking at the five response choices, we see that they are trying to explain two properties of a triangle: the number of sides and the number of angles.

Choices:  a) shirt b) food c) book d) pencil e) pants f) lamp\nRationales: What we can do to start answering this question is identify the parts of a closet. A closet typically includes a hanging rack for clothes to be hung on, drawers for storing items and a shelf for other storage.\nBased on that, the first thing that we can eliminate is \"food\". The food is stored somewhere else as part of the arrangement for a proper kitchen. Next, we can narrow down to 6 options.\nWe can eliminate \"book\" as a proper name for an item that would be found inside our closet. Instead of a book it can be identified as a \"magazine\". That narrows down our options to 5.\nWe can cross off \"pencil\". As pointed out already, the closet typically includes a shelf for other types of storage. The pencil can only be found on that shelf. So the only thing left is \"lamps\". That narrows down the options to 4.\nBased on the 4 remaining options \"lamps\", \"pants\", \"shirt\" and \"lamp\", we can cross off \"shirt\" since shirts are typically worn, not stored unless we are going on a trip or storing for a wedding, funeral, and such.

Choices: \nA: tingling B: sharp C: dull D: painful E: itchy\nRationales:\n\n1. Let's start by recognizing that option A: tingling is an inappropriate and vague answer. Alligator bites generally have an intense and irritating physical reaction. 2. To proceed, let's understand the contexts of the options. Option B: sharp is commonly associated with pain, whether caused by alligator bites or other body harm. 3. Similarly, option D painful is also inappropriate and vaguely answers the specifics of the question. Options C: dull and option E: itchy share the same issues.\n4. Option A: tingling fails to indicate the intensity of a bite and is therefore an inaccurate answer. \n5. This leaves us with a limited range of options. Looking at the rest of the question, it's clear the context refers to finding an alligator bait. As an alligator biter, alligator bites are associated with sharpness or pain, and not tingling or itching sensations.

Choices: \nA: Interference B: Blockage C: Disruption D: Disturbance E: Delivery\nRationales: Let's first consider what a train is. It is a type of vehicle that moves on tracks or a set of rails.\nSo what is a \"path\" or \"track?\"\n1. A track can also be used to describe a course or route. When you're riding a train, you're following a defined route, or path.\n2. Now, let's think about \"cross\" to determine if a term that starts with \"cross\" is a plausible answer.\n3. When two routes, or paths meet at an angle and do not intersect neatly, they cross.\n4. This does happen between moving objects such as trains.\n5. However, the answer needs to be the technical term for the situation.\n6. In this case, the situation refers to when two tracks that trains occupy, cross or converge on each other.\n7. Although a moving object might be obstructed and unable to continue, it isn't being \"blocked\" in the same way that objects are placed on the ground between two paths to obstruct them.\n8.

Consider the options - Constant, Severe, Persistent, Intermittent Mild, and Mild.\n3. Mild is the only word that describes pain and nothing else. Intermittent and Severe, Persistent may describe pain, but they are not synonymous with pain.\n4. Intermittent describes how mild pain can come and go; therefore, it is not an adjective.\n5. Persistent describes how a mild pain can last for a long time.\n6. Constant is a synonym of persistent. \n7. They are neither painful nor do they describe any unique part of the pain.\n8. Severe, on the other hand, describes pain as intense or extreme.\n9. That leaves us with B: severe and E: mild. \n10.

Choices:  thermos: contains fluid and uses gas hot water bottle: contains fluid and uses material\nRationales:\n1. Intermediate Reasoning Step: Read the words given for each of the answer choices, and underline the words in both answer choices that make the answer choices look or sound different.\n2. This will help you determine the difference.\n3. Example 1: For \"what is the difference between a car and a plane?\" The answer choices contain the words \"motor\" and \"rocket\". So the difference is that a car has a motor but a plane has a rocket.\n4. Applying this strategy to this problem;\n  A thermos contains a fluid (it is a liquid container) and the material surrounding it is usually glass or metal. Thus it is made of two or more materials/elements combined to create an object.\n  A hot water bottle contains a fluid (it holds hot water) and it has a surrounding material which is typically an air-tight cloth cushion made from a fabric like cotton. Thus it is made from one material.\n  Therefore the difference, or the distinction, between a thermos and a hot water bottle is that the hot water bottle is made of one material, while the thermos is made of two or of more materials/elements which are combined to create an object, as demonstrated in the diagram below.\n5.

E: it's free\nRationales: It's evident from the question that having a library is a benefit, as it is something that is good and useful from your perspective as a reader.\n\n1. There are two options related to studying: having a library is a way to study (A) and studying is one of the benefits of having a home library (E). These are not different options in that sense. For both the question is implied, but it's possible to find multiple implications in the same option.\n\n2. Having a library is an excellent and free way to gather information and this answer could be either A or C (B or D).\n3. Buying used books is cheaper and another (possibly correct) implication of having a library is that it allows you to get used books (not just newer ones). Therefore, you could get the benefit of C (buying used books costs less) from A (having a home library) or E (having a home librar).\n4. Since the question is about having a home library, another answer is that a home library is a quiet place to study (C). This is also an applicable answer as being quiet is an answer that doesn't necessarily require you to have a home library, but having a home library is a requirement to be quiet.\n5.

Choices: 1: the ocean A: land B: atmosphere C: air D: clouds E: air current\nRationales: Reasoning Steps (RS):  \n1. To answer the question, it's first crucial to understand what winds are and know some facts about wind.\n2. Winds are defined as moving air that travels in a particular direction. They are affected by weather patterns and other environmental conditions.\n3. To have strong winds, it is necessary for these winds to be moving at high speeds or from high force of motion due to an outside force.\n4. Options A: ocean and Choice B: atmosphere are incorrect because oceans and atmospheres are passive environments that lack wind.\n5. Similarly, C: air doesn't describe the fast movements of wind, as it is considered to be relatively still unless actively stirred or carried along by some other force. \n6. Choice E: air current can mean moving air, but this can refer to slower and less powerful air movements.\n7. Therefore the only relevant answer is D: clouds, whose definition in the word bank allows for them to generate strong winds. Clouds gather in the atmosphere, and air currents are a part of this.\n8. The air moving underneath clouds can have some force, which allows clouds to generate powerful winds depending on the weather system surrounding them. \n9.

Choices: \n A: add chips B: add sauce C: add meat D: add mustard E: none\n Rationales: Intermediate: Steps 1. Start by removing all the answer choices that do not correspond to what is considered a sandwich. The sandwich has two or more slices of bread, one of which (usually) has something on it. It also has some sort of spread or filling. 2. This means answers that do not contain at least two slices of bread are not correct. \n Also, we can eliminate \"meat\" because meat does not spread on the bread.\n 3. Only \"mustard\" is a sandwich spread. However, mustard is not \"sauce\", which is a distinct spread. We can therefore eliminate the option \"sauce.\"\n 4. Next, consider \"chips\", which could include onion slices, pickled vegetables, olives, or another type of crunchy snack.\n 5. Any of these can be considered a sandwich filler, and they can also be added to bread as chips are eaten.\n 6. However, the question asks for the \"easiest\", which means the answer should be relatively simple to do. \n 7. We can further eliminate options with multiple steps because adding \"meat\" and \"mustard\" would require preparing and slicing the meat and then spreading the mustard. \n 8. The only option left is \"add mustard\", which is the simplest answer because it just requires adding a spread to the bread while ignoring the process of preparing and slicings the meat. \n 9.

Choices:  ____ A: a front door B: blank C: a back door D: a jacket E: an index\nRationales: First, know what a book is.  Now consider the choices.  Choice A: \"The book has a front door, what?.\" You are not told what the front door is on the book.  This means it could be a real front door but it could also be a jacket which looks like a front door.  Therefore, we can eliminate this choice.  Choice B: \"The book has blank, what?.\" You have not been told anything about the book.  What can blank be?  Anything, including something that is a back door.  Therefore, this choice cannot be any specific type of back door.  Choice C: \"The book has back door, what?.\" The book has a front door and we have been told nothing about it besides that it's a front door.  For this to make sense, the book would have to have a back door and it has been told nothing about that backdoor besides that it's some type of back door. Therefore, we can eliminate that choice.  Choice D: \"The book has jacket, what?.\" The question says \"its back door.\"  A jacket is not a back door.  Choices E: \"The book has index, what?.\" An index is an item in a book.  That is not what the book has.  This leaves us with choice D: jacket, choice C: back door and choice E: index.  They all fail to satisfy the logical requirements of the question.

Choices: 1. on top of a mountain A: yes B: no 2. by water C: yes B: no\nRationales: Consider options on top of a mountain and by water.\n1. \"On top of a mountain\" can make sunsets more dramatic, but that isn't enough of a reason to rank it higher than other options for best viewing.\n2. Other locations along a mountain can be just as good, and the top doesn't necessarily have the best view.\n3. It may be better to go to a hilltop or high cliff than a specific peak that doesn't offer the most compelling view.\n4.

Choices: \nA: bank B: department store C: hospital D: store E: storefront\nRationales:\n1. The question here is asking where consumers go to buy a cellphone. To answer this, let's take a look at each choice.\n2. Bank: the answer is unlikely to be at a bank, as banks are not primarily businesses that sell merchandise.\n3. A department store, such as a Walmart Superstore or Home Depot: not unlikely, but not the first choice because department stores carry a variety of merchandise and sell a range of different items, so it might not be the first stop for a consumer looking to buy a cellphone from that choice.\n4. A hospital: unlikely as hospitals are for providing health and medical service, rather than providing goods and merchandise. \n5. A store: the answer is definitely a store, so the question is where kind of store?\n6. To answer this, we simply have to eliminate the two choice that are unlikely, and the remaining two are still possible choices.\n7. A storefront sells only the same type of product, such as clothing, cosmetics, furniture, or technology. With this in mind, we can eliminate the option E: storefront, as the question asks for a cellphone, not a storefront.\n8. The choice C: hospital could be a place where a cellphone is sold, but this doesn't answer the question and it's unlikely that a hospital would be a place to buy a cellphone, so it's eliminated from the answer.\n9. This leaves us with options B: department store and D: store. But only one of these choice is acceptable option.\n10. Option B: a department store is not the most likely choice as it only sells a range of similar products.\n11. Therefore, the answer to the", "answer": " 7"}

Choices: 1. A: a bridge. 2. B: an ark. 3. C: a house. 4. D: a rocket\nRationales: Think about the question. How can you actually build any of these things with a one-inch board? For a bridge, the board could serve as the base or part of the structure. However, it could not actually support the whole weight of the bridge. It would need to be much larger than one inch to do that. Similarly, there's no way a tiny board can support the weight of an ark, which would likely be larger than a boat. For a house, a tiny board would not be large enough to support even a very simple house. Finally, a rocket would also require multiple sheets of a much larger material, not just a tiny board. \nThese points can be applied to the answer choices. \nThe correct answer to the question would be an ark. This implies a large structure to carry people or animals in a survival situation. It can still be constructed from a board, but not from a tiny one-inch board. \nLooking at the four possible answer choices: \n1. A: a rocket is impossible (see earlier discussion).\n2. B: an Ark, is within reason, but it sounds silly to say 'a tiny board.'\n3. C: a House doesn't make sense for the same reason that an ark does.\n4.

Choices:  A. by measuring the area and dividing it by pi B. by multiplying the area by pi C. by half the circumference D. by the distance of the circumference E. by cutting the circle in half\nRationales: An answer would: 1. describe how to determine the diameter of a circle, in a specific way. 2. be in accordance with the context of being \"measured.\" If you use \"cut,\" that may make more sense for cutting food, but here that's not the focus, so that wouldn't be an appropriate choice. 3. If you use \"distance,\" that may be acceptable for the distance between two points, such as the earth from the sun. But, in this context the distance refers to the perimeter around a closed shape and is not considered an \"area.\"\n\nAnswer: Choices that are incorrect: 1. A: by measuring the area by dividing it by pi is incorrect as no measurements to an area are performed and you don't even state that you're measuring the area. 2. C: by dividing the circumference by half the circumference as a measure for the diameter of a circle is incorrect as it doesn't measure the diameter and this is not a method for measuring the diameter of a circle as a measure. 3.

This cuts the circle into two pieces but doesn't measure the original circle.\nNow, we can only choose remaining options. 4. E: by measuring the actual diameter of the circle as it is not by simply measuring the area. An item can be described as circular without giving its area or circumference.

Choices: 1. home 2. airport 3. beach 4. prison\nRationales:\n1. The question asks where someone is most likely to spend their last days, or death days. It's most likely at home, which is where a person spends the majority of their life (the answer is option 1).\n2. It's unlikely that the question refers to an airport because the question is asking about a person's last days, which makes it unlikely that they would be traveling to an airport.\n3. Also, it's unlikely that the beach is the correct answer because it's a common misconception that dying people visit the beach, which is actually a myth.\n4. The answer that best matches the question is option 4: prison. Prison is where people are incarcerated for crimes and it is where a person's final days will be spent if they are serving a life sentence. \n5. This can also be concluded based on the context, as there is already information given about a criminal who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting his execution.\n6. There is a strong likelihood that the criminal will be incarcerated in a prison until their execution date.\n7. There is nothing directly said about the criminals having access to the beach or the airport, and even if they do, one would expect that they would spend their time in prison instead of those locations. \n8. The correct answer is option 4: the prison.\nAnswer: B. Prison\n\nInput: What did the farmer do to reduce fertilizer costs? Choices: \n1. Hire a fertilizer expert 2. Purchase new equipment. 3.

Choices: 1 A: an engine 2 C: the wheels 3 B: the brakes\nRationales: First, the car is a mechanical device, primarily requiring mechanical components. They are the parts that make the car function and move. The engine helps the car to start and run. The wheels provide its mobility, and the breaks are for stopping or slowing it down.\n1. If you need a car, you need, at least, an engine, and the wheels. There are other mechanical aspects such as the steering or seat belts, but without an engine, the car is useless.\n2. The brakes are necessary for breaking and slowing down. This is also a mechanical component of the car. The engine needs to work, and the wheels need to move to be functional.\n3. All parts of a car (not including the external features such as paint or exterior) rely on or consist of mechanical components such as the engine, the wheels, and the brakes.\n4. The most necessary mechanical parts of the car are the engine and the wheels as the car cannot move without having a mechanical part to drive it.\n5. Therefore the best components of a car are the engine and wheels as they are responsible for starting, stopping and moving the car.\n6. The brakes are technically required, but as a mechanical part, they are less essential.\n7. Because the engine and wheels are the main parts of a car's movement, they cannot be separated as they work together to start, stop, slow, and move the car.\n8. And finally, the answer to the problem is the answer will be C - the wheels.\nAnswer: C : wheels", "answer": " 96"}

Choices: 10:1 A: 100 B: 12.5 C: 11.25 D: 12 E: 15\nRationales: First, find the unit of foot and then answer the question for the conversion factor between feet and meters.\n\n1. The unit for feet is written as \"ft\", which we can infer from the question, since it says the answer should be \"to the nearest foot\".\n2. However, it also says the answer should be in feet, which suggests that the unit of meter is implied in the question, not a different unit such as yards or inches.\n3. Therefore, we can assume the unit in question will be \"m\", and we just need to determine what the conversion factor is between feet and meters. \n4. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we know feet can be converted to inches by multiplying by 12. \n5. One inch is one twelfth of a foot. If we multiply 12 inches by one twelfth, we get an answer of 1 foot = 1 / 12 feet = 1 / 0.0833 feet = 12 / 0.00833 meters = 15 meters.\n6. We can confirm it works for 1 meter = 12 /0.008 feet = 15 feet.\n7. For 100 meters = 100 x 12 / 2.54 meters = 12 /2.54 meters.\n8.

Choices: 1. two thousand feet 2. fifty feet 3. ten feet 4. three inches 5. eight million miles\nRationales:\n1. Understand the task. It asks how far a bullet would travel before breaking apart.\n2. This means that the answer should describe a distance or length.\n3. Consider options one and two. \n4. Option one is way too specific - a thousand yards - and not long enough to fit the description of the bullet.\n5. Option two is 50 feet, which is longer than the bullet would typically travel before it breaks.\n6. Options three, four, and five are all very long, but they don't describe how far it should travel before breaking into smaller pieces.\n7. Option four is the only one in meters. However, converting from miles to feet and back does not change the distance.\n8. It is clear this is not the answer.\n9.

Choices: A: bend B: stretch C: fold D: wrap F: none\nRationales: After reading this question you need to ask yourself an important question: What can be bent?  If you think of a physical item that can be bent in several ways then you can definitely think of a pen.  The same is true for a metal wire.  But, what if the word to use was stomp?  Or lion?  \n\nLet's apply what we went through to this situation. If you are stomping on something, then you are using some form of force or pressure to cause the item to break/crumble.  If you were to stomp on the surface of Mars (the Red Planet for children of the 80's/90's...like me) then the surface would break, or you wouldn't be able to step on it.  And what is a lion (aka the king of the jungle...a beast with a ferocious reputation)?  It's another animal that could possibly be bent (by its paws if need be).\n\nNow, I want to give some credit to the question asker. The asker asked a similar question. The only real difference is that I simplified the question slightly.  And...I think even I made the question a little too simple.  But that's okay, because I would like to give some insight in this paragraph as to why what I did was in my opinion necessary.\n\nSometimes a question becomes too simple when it is presented too straightforwardly, with the focus being on one part of the question.

Tacos refer to \na cooked food consisting of various meats and vegetables filled in corn tortillas, and the tortillas are a staple food in Mexican cooking. Tacos were invented in Mexico because the tortillla is the basis of it as the Taco Bell Corporation is an American chain of fast-food restaurants that serves mainly Tex-Mex food to its customers. The tacos are based on a type of cooked food, in Mexico is based on a different type of cook food.\n6. This suggests that the invention of tacos originated in Mexico.\n7. Mexican food has different roots, which means the Mexican people also have a different culture.\n8. The Mexicans were indigenous people of Mexico, and they brought all the dishes with them.\n9. They also made corn tortillas which is a basic ingredient of a taco.\n10. Also, when the Spaniards arrived to invade the country, they brought them new dishes to mix with their dishes.\n11.

Choices:  [A] by hitting it with a ball. [B] by spilling hot sauce on it. [C] by turning off all the lights. [D] by tearing it to shreds. [E] by touching it from the side.\nRationales: First, understand the question:\n1. We are asked to consider how the image above got destroyed.\n2. The text suggests there was intentional destruction. This leads us to identify the cause as an action or actions on the part of the individuals responsible for destroying the image.\n3. As this is a visual question, one can only make an informed guess if there is sufficient visual clues to give a logical answer.\n4. Looking at the choices, we see that A and B are related to the use of a ball and hot sauce (a liquid), respectively, while C and D are about the use of light and touch, respectively, as tools.\n5. However, we also note that A through D are choices for the cause, and E is a result, and not a cause.\n6. When the result and chosen cause are compared, we can see that E, the result or outcome, cannot be chosen as we were asked to identify the cause.\n7. E has been deliberately destroyed and thus cannot be a choice as the cause.\n8. This leaves us with C, A, B, and D as potential causes.\n9. The two physical processes on the image are the tearing to shreds and the damage to the top layer of the image. While they may damage the image, both involve little to no destruction.\n10.

Thus, B is the correct answer; it's an environment characterized by large garbage dumps where unwanted waste is disposed of, such as landfills.\nAnswer: B: landfill\n\nInput: The farmer grew potatoes, carrot, and wheat, where would he take them? Choices: \nA: carpets store B: carpet factory C: supermarket D: food store E: food factory F: food factory G: pets store\nRationales: Given that: \n1. The farmer grew potato, carrot and wheat.\n2. \"Carrot\" is a word that is not a part of the list of choices.\n3. \"Carrots\" are usually bought from 'carrot stores or supermarkets' rather than a carpet factory.\n4. \"Food factory\" is a generic term, for any food sourcing place and includes carpets and wheat, not carrots. The question talks about pets and cats, but cats are excluded in the list choices.\nHence, we see that all the choices are invalid. Concluding, the farmer will either take his produce to a store (G) or his own carpet factory (H).\nAnswer: E: food factory\n\nInput: In a school, where would you get bread?

Choices: 1: Their parents' genes 2: The absence of pigment 3: Their racial origins 4: They are related to chimpanzees 5: They enjoy being in the dark 6: They're anatomical\nRationales: Given the context, it is clear that choices 1: The parents' genes, are not a possible reason why people have black hair. This is because people inherit hair colour from two of their four grandparents (not necessarily from either of their parents). Furthermore, it is also not possible to have a parent that has black hair (hair colour being genetically determined by the parents).\n\n1. Next, the absence of pigment is not a possible reason for having black hair. Pigment refers to melanin in a hair sample. Black hair has a high concentration of melanin. This means that the absence of pigments cannot explain black hair, as all hair will have some concentration of pigment.\n2. Choice 2 is a possible reason as people who have black hair are the ones who lack the ability to make melanin. However, it is still not the correct choice.

Warm: - has two possible meanings: a) To become warm b) stay warm\n4. Icebergs: - refers to a massive piece of ice\n5. Ocean: - refers to the water that covers most of the Earth\n6. Arctic: - includes extremely cold temperatures\n7. Igloo: - a type of structure made by Eskimos to protect against the cold\n8. Hot water: - to turn into a liquid (boil) or to heat\n1. After reading the question, we know that we are asked where the penguin stays warm, which could mean that the penguin doesn't live in the water, because they don't boil on icebergs.\n2. There is only one answer related to warmth that doesn't require boiling liquid.\n3. There is an extremely cold place where an iceberg would stay.\n4. There is a place described as cold.\n5. There is a place where water boils or has extremely cold water.\n6. There is a place describing a structure where it can be hot; therefore it is a possible answer.\n7.

Choices: 1. It is anatomically incorrect 2. It is not the intended destination 3. The food escapes 4. The contents become too hot 5. The food is poison\nRationales: If you choose 'it's anatomically incorrect' or its opposite number, 'it's anatomecally correct', the correct answer would be the complete opposite of that statement. \n2 or 6 could be correct if no food passes through the stomach, as it 'turns inside out'. But the food doesn't 'become' either hot or poisonous (although it may become poisoned if contaminated).\nIt is incorrect that 'it is not the intended destination', as the stomach is the first step of the digestive process, though it may be incorrect that 'it escapes in the wrong direction'.  \nTherefore, it is more likely that the 4 that 'The food escapes' is the answer.\nAnswer: 1.

Choices:  Truck A: car B: house C: school bus D: bicycle E: piano\nRationales: The question tells us that it is asking about the heavier object, and thus will not be asking about the object that is the more massive.\n1. A car (choice A) is always a lightweight object. \n2. A house (choice B) has been given as a potential heavy object but it is unlikely to be considered heavier than a car because it is typically so much larger than a car.\n3. A school bus (choice C) is almost always a heavy object, but it is unlikely to pass as heavier for a pair of objects, as it is unlikely for a truck (choice D) to be paired with a school bus.\n4. The given object that is the most massive is always the more massive, so we need to pick an object that we know is heavier, therefore taking B: house and D: bicycle out of contention, and thus leaving choice E: piano.\n5. But how can you definitively tell which is the heavier if there is too much of an unevenness in their masses, as in a piano vs a truck?\n6. Fortunately there is a clear way: choose the smaller object. A weight of 100kg is much lighter than a weight of 30kg or 18kg or even 12kg. A piano of 500kg is much more massive than a truck of 10,000kg. \n7. Based on this, conclusion draw that choice E: piano is the heavier item.\nAnswer: E - PIANO", "answer": " 325"}

Consider that all of the answer choices except for option F, \"music recital,\" are locations where people might find pianos.\n4. Remember, though, that the question asks for a location where you'd find them, so the correct answer must be a location where people go and pianos are readily available there.\n5.

Choices:  a) pod b) pod c) school d) mob\nRationales: Here the question asks us what you call a group of Dolphins.\n1. There are two different meanings of \"school\" which can be confusing in this context. It can either have the conventional meaning of a group of fish as a school, or it can refer to a school of children.\n2. The former meaning is not relevant because Dolphins cannot be called a \"school\" of fish, although they typically swim in schools or groups.\n3. The latter meaning is also incompatible because a \"school\" of children is called a class.\n4. In the end, the word \"school\" can refer to a group of dolphin as the standard meaning of what one normally thinks of when the term is used. It refers to a group or pod of dolphins.\n5. \"Pod\" can be an option, but it does not fit with the term Dolphins because the animals are typically seen separately.\n6.

H: Ignorance can be dangerous. I: A lot of knowledge can harm you.\nRationales:\n\n1. There are no answer choices related to the expression's source.\n2. The question describes the expression's meaning, not who originated it.\n3. The question doesn't explicitly say that we should answer in simple one-word definitions (for example, option H: ignorance), so we will need to define the expression carefully and look for patterns to match all the options.\n4. It's very possible that you recognized one of the options as a definition of the expression.\n5. However, if you simply selected that definition, it's likely because another one of the options was defined in the same way and the answers overlapped.\n6. For example, \"A lot of knowledge can harm/hurt you\": it's not always safe to have a wealth of knowledge, just as too much knowledge could be dangerous.\n7. So, to find the correct answer, we must review all the options and see if any of them fit the definition accurately.\n8. It's important to recognize that the answer may not be an exact word-for-word match to the original definition. Look for an answer that corresponds to the original meaning and context.\n9.

A parachute uses a rocket system to slow down a descent by using a backpack and a parachute.\n2. A paraglide uses a backpack with a parachute as well, and the wing of a paraglider generates lift as it descends via air resistance. The paraglide slows the descent significantly compared to a parachute. \n3. Thus, a paraglide is used during daytime missions, it is much faster, and uses air resistance to generate lift.\n4.

Choices: 1-3 options\nRationales: We can begin by understanding the context of the question in the passage. This text is in the \"Wall\" section of Mathway, and the Wall section is intended to \"provide supplemental material that can guide your mathematical thinking and understanding.\" This passage has a title and the following text: \"The launching of a rocket is a matter of the right amount, at the right time, of a series of explosions, to the right degree. The right amount is determined by the amount of fuel required by the launching pad, the size of the vehicle, and the height to which it must be launched. The right degree is determined by the amount and quality of the explosives, and the design and quality of the rocket casing or body. The right time is the result of accurate readings of the instruments and a thorough knowledge of the mathematical factors involved in the launching. The right degree is also affected by the experience of the men who have learned to understand the readings and know what the rocket will do. The right time and accurate readings indicate when and how the rocket body must separate from the rocket casing. With the casing no longer acting as a brake on the rocket body, it accelerates and travels into space, carrying a payload from the earth. These stages - the right amount, degree, time, and the right readings - add up to the launching of a roket. The stages are the building of a rocket, the readings, the calculation of force, and the launching.\" Let's read the last sentence of the sentence together: \"The stages are the building of the rocket, the readouts, the calculation of force and the launch.\" Let's read each one and talk about that part: The stages... What do you think this part means what happens in the \"stages? Reading... What's the reading? Reading... \"the read-outs, so read-outs can only be things that are happening. So maybe one of them is the calculation of force, to calculate force means to add them up, so maybe it's this", "answer": " 100"}

The hole where liquid can come out is called a? Choices:  a: spout b: puncture c: drip drip drip e: fissure f: perforation g: seepage\nRationales: When an ice pop is frozen, it is solid. When you thaw the ice pop, you are creating a liquid or a semi-liquid state of matter. This liquid flows because when you thaw a frozen ice pop, it creates a material on the end of the ice pop that melts and flows. This liquid is then pushed out through a hole which results in the hole as a leak. The hole that a liquid flows through is called a: spout or a leak; thus this can be called a spout or perforation in any order. If you said: spout, it is correct. If you said: perforation, it is in fact incorrect.\nAnswer: A spout can be called a leak, or a perforation in any given order.

A two dimensional shape that is round in nature has two dimensions - area and perimeter - and therefore could be referred to as a 2D shape. \n3. A circle is a good example of such a shape, so option B: circle is a suitable choice.\n4. When referring to 2D shapes, one typically thinks about shapes with the basic characteristics of length and width, and thus rectangles are favored over more complex shapes like cubes and spheres. \n5. Additionally, circles are an important and common type of 2 dimensional shape.\n6. Therefore the answer has to be C: circle.\nAnswer: B: circle\n\nInput: What would you call a man who is taller than his father and shorter than his brother? Choices: 1. A: big 2. B: small 3.

Choices: A: heavy lifting B: light stretches C: jogging D: brisk walking long walks E: bicycling\nRationales: First understand the question. \n1. This question asks for the best type of exercise to keep your heart healthy.\n2. We know this because the word \"heart\" is mentioned in the sentence and also stated in the question that it is related to keeping your heart healthy. It is also the main focus of the question.\n3.

In this problem one needs to determine where to learn how to drive. There are five potential places listed in the choices.\n2. It's clear that H: school does not represent a \"place to drive,\" so the answer cannot be that.\n3. Another option that would \"drive\" a person to the correct response is H: garage. However, this would be misleading since the answer would be for learning how to drive a car, but they would normally \"drive\" a car from a garage.\n4. A fourth choice that would cause the answer to be incorrect is E: driveway as you would \"drive\" on a \"driveway\" to park your car in the garage. \n5. A fifth misleading response choice would be C: store as one would walk on a \"sidewalk\" and not \"drive\" to a \"store\". \n6. Therefore, one must first determine the purpose for learning how to drive, so a driving school seems like the logical choice.\n7.

Since the word \"phone\" is used in the other terms, it is logical to infer that \"phone\" is a common component of the terms.\n2. Further, the word \"phone\" has several meanings, therefore we should be careful about how one particular word might be used in one term and a slightly different meaning applied in another term.\n3. Consider the meanings assigned to the terms and observe that the only term that makes the most sense considering this particular word is \"A: cell phone\". A cell phone is a portable telephone (mobile phone), whereas a telephone is not necessarily portable (mobile or cell) and is not limited to mobile (wireless) use. In the term \"cell\", the component \"phone\" must hold its original meaning that this is a wireless communications device with a voice interface. \n4.

C: in the air 4. D: water area 5. E: inside building\nRationale: 1. The word \"outside\" refers to areas or features of the amusement park that are not part of the indoor space or buildings of the park.\n2. A ride on the roof is not possible without using other parts of the amusement park as part of the attraction, so this rule itself is not a match.\n3. The amusement park is not built on water, and rides are typically found on the ground, the indoor space, or the roof of buildings, so they are also not good choices.\n4. If an amusement park ride were meant to be out over water, it would be best described as flying, \"in air,\" or \"on the water.\" \n5. To fly in air, there needs to be air to be in. There are no rides directly on the water, so riding on the air over the water is needed. \n6. The correct answer is therefore B: roof.\nAnswer: B : roof\n\nInput: How do fruits grow? Choices: 0-1.

Choices:  a. school B. landfill C. store D. office E. house\nRationales: As in the previous question, the question asked which is the most likely place where you will find a broken calculator.\n1. The question mentions that the place could be a school, landfill, store, office, or house.\n2. It may therefore take several questions for you to narrow down the possible answers to just one.\n3. As with other similar questions, you can eliminate unlikely options based on this rule.\n4. Option A, \"school,\" is a place where calculators may be found, but you'd probably replace the broken one rather than throwing it out in the landfill. Therefore, this is eliminated.\n5. Option B, \"landfill\", is a place where broken calculators are often found because it is a place where discarded objects are placed. This option is therefore the most likely answer.\n6. Option C, \"store,\" is also a place where calculators are often available to purchase. However, when a calculator breaks people usually take it to a repair shop or throw it away because they no longer find much use for them. Therefore, this option is also unsuitable.\n7. Option D, \"office\", is likely not where broken calculators are found because it is a workplace, not a place where you'll find many leisure items. Therefore, it is eliminated.\n8. Option E, \"house\", is a location where calculators may be present. However, most of a calculator's broken parts may be hidden so it cannot be considered broken without an initial inspection.\n\n1.

E: museum\nRationales: The question is asking about the place where crayons can be found. Crayons are used for drawing and art activities, so we can infer that we are searching for a place where art supplies are sold, and also a place where drawing in general may take place. \n\nLet us see these places in terms of what can be found inside them. \n\n1. A: school. Schools are places of learning where students sit down at desks to study their books. Inside a school, they may find a pencil case, which typically contains crayons, but is not a guaranteed item. Additionally, art may be included in the curriculum, but it will not be the focus in this environment.\n2. B: office. The office is a place of work where employees sit at a desk and use their computers to do work. The office may not keep crayons, and if it does they are likely to be used by employees (for personal use) rather than school projects. We can eliminate this answer.\n3. C: music shop. Many instruments are stored in the music shop, and this includes musical instruments and drawing tools; a student could buy school supplies at the music shop. However, the store owner isn't likely to have crayons in stock, and the products available are mainly musical instruments rather than art tools.\n4. D: art store. An art store is a shop that sells art supplies, including crayons. However, since it is not a school-specific item, this isn't the best option.\n5. E: a museum. Museums hold collections of historic artifacts from the past, and the pieces on display are not meant for children to play with, so crayons are not commonly found in any art galleries.\nTherefore, the", "answer": " 6"}

A: cluster 2. B: constellation 3. C: cluster 4. D: comet E: meteor\nRationales: First, let us identify the question's context. Students are provided with a choice of options which are each meant to be understood as \"a group of stars\".\nThe context indicates that students must only identify the term that describes a group of stars, without providing any extra details.\n  Now that we have established the task, let's consider each of the options: \n  - Option 1, A: \"a cluster\" is described as: 1. in astronomy, a group of stars that appears as a single star.\n  - Option 2, B: \"a constellation\" is described as: In astronomy, a configuration of stars that appears to represent a particular shape or pattern.\n  - Option C, D, and E have a similar definition and are used interchangeably in reference to a particular group of stars, such that an individual star can be a member of multiple groups of stars at once. This means that they all represent \"a group of stars\" and are therefore all correct answers \n  While this may be a matter of semantics, it would be a misconception that a group of stars is represented by only one of these terms. This is why the only choice that is indeed an accurate and complete answer to this question is C: \"a group of stars\"; the other terms are either too narrow in scope (such as D & E) or overly broad in scope (such as A & B), making them less likely to be accepted as an acceptable answer. \nAnswer: C: \"a group stars\", which is the only option that is both acceptable and complete\n\nInput: Where can you find a map of the world Choices: A: in the dictionary B: on a computer C: in a textbook D: online\nRationales: The answer is C:", "answer": " 140"}

As water's properties enable it to adapt to different shapes and forms, these forms don't have any effect on the chemical composition of hydrogen and oxygen. Considering the options, it becomes clear that A: bathtub is not a form of H2O. \n4. Bathtubs store water, so it's an object (not H2O). \n5.

Choices:  A. zero B. one C. a D. anything E. infinite\nRationales: Mathematical symbols are used to represent numbers or quantities. They have specific names and properties assigned to them.\nTherefore, before attempting to answer the division of infinity question, it's necessary to know how to interpret the symbol used and what it's telling us.\n1. To understand \"division,\" we typically think of splitting things into separate parts. However, in this context, we can observe that the term \"division\" has a different meaning here; it refers to the mathematical relationship between two quantities. That is;\n2. Given that \"sub\" is a prefix that refers to being smaller or inferior to something else, it's obvious that it cannot be used to represent infinity. The same can be said about the use of the prefix \"super,\" which means above something.\n3. Similarly, the term \"infinity\" implies that the entire quantity is larger and not smaller than something else.\n4. However - and this is the crucial observation - when we use the term \"division,\" the two quantities involved are not necessarily one larger than the other. \n5. Given the", "answer": " 42"}

The \"living room\" is an appropriate choice if the TV belongs to the family, \n2. while \"kitchen\" might be an appropriate choice if it was used or sold in that room. \"Bedroom\" could be accurate if the TV belonged to an unmarried couple, \n3. as \"bathroom\" could be accurate in that case, as well. \"Office\" could be accurate if a TV was bought or sold by an employee. \n4. Thus, of the answer choices, it is more likely that TVs would be found in the \"bedroom\" or \"bathroom\".\n5.

Choices:  Stratosphere  A: Troposphere  D: Aerocity B: Troposphere  C: Heliography  E: Stratosphere\nRationales:\n1. Consider the answer based on the context of the question, where it is stated that a parachute is lowered. If it is lowered, it can only be within an existing atmosphere and will need to open somewhere. \n2. The atmosphere is divided into the troposphere, stratosphere, and mesosphere in levels.\n3. Consider troposphere options first - they are the lowest atmosphere levels.\n4. \"Stratosphere D: Aerocity\" is incorrect as it is outside the troposphere and therefore is not possible.\n5. Stratosphere B: Troposphere is the next lowest available option and is a probable possibility, but it could also be in the mesosphere or higher layers.\n6. From there, consider the mesosphere and higher layers of atmospheric layers, but there is also a chance that the parachute will open in the troposphere after all the available levels are considered. \n7.

The cerebellum is a structure located behind the brain that is responsible for coordinating muscular activity.\nThe cerebrum is the front part of the brain which is responsible for intelligence, personality, voluntary movement, thought, and understanding. The Cerebrum is the largest part of the brain and is divided into two hemispheres. One hemisphere of the cerebrum controls the movement of the arms and the other controls movement in the legs. 3. Brain anatomy refers to the physical structure of the brain and describes all the different structures that make up the brain.\nBrain anatomy also includes the blood vessels and the neural network.\nBrain structure and function is the name given to all the brain's structures and functions.

Choices: 1: 2: 3: 4: 5\nRationales: It is necessary to think about the position of the earth in space.\nIt is a point in its orbit of rotation around the Sun.\nWe should consider the sun as the main star from which the earth revolves around.\nThe orbit is in the shape of a circle. It is not a rectangle, square or triangle. Also, note that it is in orbit, around a third party, the Sun. (Not a circle for which you ask?)\nAnother factor is that when the Earth travels at a very high speed around the Sun at almost 30 km/s it will continue to increase in speed. Hence, the Earth is not in an orbit. It just takes 365\u00bc days or one Earth Year to be exactly at the same point in its orbit.\nThe Earth takes 23 hours 56 minutes and 4.09053 seconds to completely rotate or rotate about its own axis.\nTherefore, the answer to the question must be Choice 2. We can describe the Earth's orbit as a circle.\nAnswer: B) An orbit is a circular or elliptical path in which a body revolves around another body.\n\nInput: What is a glow? Choices: A: The light given off by an incandescent light bulb. B: An energy source that emits a visible light. C: A chemical reaction that produces light. D: A flashlight that emits a bright light.

B: by breathing air 3. C: by burning wood 4. D: by falling to Earth 5. E: by running away\nRationales: First, recognize that the question asks how the first human to die in the sun becomes supernova. \nIn this question, a supernova is an intense, temporary increase in light and radiation from an exploding star. \nAccording to the question, there isn't any special precondition for the first human to die and to become a supernova.  There is no additional requirement for how the human dies apart from dying.  Let us now find relevant clues to solve the question.\nThere are only five answer choices B through E are relevant based on the context of the question, and these answer choices are all about the death.  But, none of these choices are directly related to becoming supernova. This can eliminate answer choices A: by getting out a bed and D: by falling to the Earth.\nFrom this context, we can determine that none of the answer choices describe how the human being becomes a supernova.\nThe first answer choice C: by burning wood provides more information about their death.  This answer choice describes what the human dies.  But, this is not relevant for solving the task since we are only concerned about their death, not their death process. \nNow, let's check what the humans' death process describes, and consider the following 2 questions. \nThe question does not ask about their death, but it asks about how the first human to dies in the sun becomes supernovae.

In the question \u201cHow does the sun get warm?\u201d our objective is to understand how does the sun become hot/warm.\n2. To do so, we can observe the choices and discard the ones that are not relevant to the sun.\n3. Choices A (big star) and D (magnetic field) don\u2019t make sense.\n4. Choices C (sun's core emits heat) and E (none of the above) aren't specific.\n5.

As an alligator is an amphibian, but a snake is not, option E: One has scales will not be an option because an amphibian would not have scales.\n2. Option D: One crawls will not be an option as both a snake and an amphibian can move sideways\n3. Options A, B and C all compare two aspects of the two animals, so they are not applicable.\n4.

In this case, it is a dead animal of a species that is known to live where we find it and is likely to be killed by a predator or hunter of the species. In addition, it has a hole in it, suggesting that a hunter may have killed it. \n1. If we have a scenario where the dead animal is eaten, likely the species lives where it was found; we can therefore rule that option \u2464 is not the answer. \n2. \u2463, Dispose of it, is simply discarding the dead animal. This is a possibility if the dead animal is either the end product of an animal that may have been eaten by another species; this is unlikely given the scenario given.\n3. \u2463 is therefore eliminated. \n4. Similarly, \u2463 Dispose of it, can be eliminated as it is a possibility.\n5. This means we can conclude that we can rule out \u2463 Disposing of it. \n6. \u2463 Discarding it, suggests the owner or keeper of the land where the dead animal was found is liable or responsible for its continued care. As this is the case, it is the role of a keeper to continue caring for their land as specified in the terms of ownership. \n7. We can conclude that the correct answer is \u2460 Putting It Back.

All we need to do is determine the location where each of these weather elements has the maximum influence. \n1. Rain is more likely to occur in areas that are near the ocean coastline. Therefore, if you are on a coastline, it is important to take shelter whenever it rains or threatens to rain, but not as crucial if you are inland.\n2. Lightning is more likely to occur near or along coasts and on areas with tall, isolated mountains or peaks. Therefore, if you find yourself in or near such locations under a thunderstorm, you should be more cautious as the risk of lightning is higher here compared to other places.\n3. The question does not mention any weather elements that pose a risk to those in buildings.\n4. It also does not mention extreme temperatures. Therefore, buildings provide the best protection from these weather elements.\n5. For sunlight, the question also requires you to specify where you find yourself under a clear sky. Since direct sunlight is strongest here, you will most likely be safe from its harm in buildings as well.\n6. The question does not indicate the time of day or season during which rain, lightning, high temperatures, or sunlight is most likely.\n7. Therefore the only answer choice it could be referring to is the weather element (B: High temperatures) found outdoors.\n8. It is less likely to ask an inappropriately generalised answer.

The word \"like\" in the question is an informal verb. People use this word to talk about things they are fond of, such as food, friends, movies, pets, etc.\n2. Here, it is used to talk about liking ice cream. Note that the sentence can be rephrased to emphasize this point: \"Do you like ice cream?\"\n3. This is different from the question \"Do you like eating?\" where you can answer \u201cyes or no,\u201d but in this case, the word \"like\" refers to more than just eating. \n4. So, the answer cannot be a simple choice of \"yes\" or \"no.\"\n5. When someone asks if we like something, we can answer with \"yes.\" However, \"no\" cannot be a suitable answer unless the questioner is asking \"Do you like eying at me?\"\n6. Alternatively, \"it might be hard\" can also be a suitable answer, but it has a very different meaning. Think about it as a nonstandard phrase or idiom. \n7. Consider the meaning of \"it might be hard to swallow this pill.\" In this case, \"it might be\" refers to your difficulty in swallowing a pill.\n8. Similarly, \"it might be,\" followed by something hard to swallow in this context means it might be hard for the person to \"like\" or be fond of something. It's just not easy to like something. \n9.

Choices:  a. dish soap b. sink c. cleaning brush d. bucket e. sponge\nRationales: Reasoning steps:\n\n1. First of all, identify the key concept in the problem: \"wash dishes\".\n2. We can determine that the key concept here is simply the act of washing dishes, and we can start eliminating choices that are not directly related to this.\n3. Eliminate options A-C because they describe something that's not needed to wash dishes. Anything needed to do this (like soap) must be specified.\n4. This leaves us with options D and E. We need to look for what D represents.\n5. Since D doesn't represent something we need to wash dishes, we can continue to narrow choices.\n6. However, D includes B (which describes something that's not necessary to wash dishes) and A (the key concept) isn't a choice, so D can't be an option for what you use to wash the dishes.\n7. Therefore D is not an option for the correct answer, and choice E must be correct.\nAnswer: E sponge\n\nInput: Why is it important to stay hydrated? Choices: 1. Because of a lack of water. 2.

Choices:  A and D B and C C and D both A and C A and B\nRationales: A. The sentence has a conjunction in it connecting two different parts.\nB. That conjunction is \"and\".\nC. Conjunctions typically do not introduce a new sentence so a conjunction at the beginning of a sentence indicates that the following words need to be connected to the sentence before it.\nD. The original sentence has two more words which need to be connected to a sentence, and so \"and\" joins them as a coordinate conjunction.\nE. This sentence can also be rewritten as: \"I would like my toppings in my toppings.\" which can be done with a subordinating conjunction that begins with the word \"that\".\nF. The correct answer is \"D\".\nAnswer: D: both A and C\n\n### Explanation:\nWe have a sentence with the conjunction \"and\".\nBecause of this, the \"danger\" words are \"and\" and \"at the end\"\nThe first danger word is \"at the end\" because \"and\" is connecting to an already existing sentence.\nTherefore we must have a conjunction before \"and\" to link to a sentence.\nSince we cannot have a conjunction before the previous sentence, we must have a conjunctive (\"and\") word at the end of the previous sentence to put in the other one - otherwise, it is \"danger\".\nAfter we add this, the original words \"and\" and \"in my toppings\" are linking to a new sentence, so the \"danger\" word is \"and\"\nAfter we connect, the conjunction \"and\" goes to the previous sentence again, causing us to have \"and\" before \"my\"\nNow that \"my\" is \"danger\", we need to change \"my\" to \"the end\" so as a result, \"and\" becomes dangerous\nNow we don't have \"and", "answer": " 12"}

Choices: 15: A: through a forest B: across a bridge C: on the river D: at the lake E: at the top of a cliff\nRationales: Questions about finding one's way out of a forest are commonly answered by noting that one is on the edge of a forest. In this case, however, the context (a \"breeze is blowing up the hill\" and the speaker is \"standing on a hill\") indicates that the speaker is standing in a forest. There are not necessarily any trees in the forest, but there are definitely trees around 60% of the time that that word is used (the most common usage includes \"were you standing in the forest?\") It is therefore possible that none of the answer choices are a good option. However, the answers all include some word that could technically be used to describe a forest. Thus, we can assume that the answer includes a forest-related word. The four answers (B: across a bridge, C: at the lake, D: at the top of the lake, and E: in the lake) all contain a word that generally indicates a water source. None of the other options can be used in this context.\nA: A is an option because we technically can say \"you can be in a \"forest\" area next to a cliff\".\n\n### Demofication:\nInput: Where does a river lead to?

Choices: \t A: for screwing up \t B: as a key \t C: for pounding \t D: to open doors \t\tE: as a door stop\nRationales:\t 1. The question refers to how to use a wrench and asks about its intended application, rather than what it's used for. \n2. We can eliminate options that cannot be applied as a wrench, which include option A: for screwed up. \n3. Option B: as a key is also not a use of a wrench, and the question is about its intended use, not actual use. \n4. Similarly, options C: for pounding and D: to open doors are not specific roles for wrenches as they imply that they are used to increase the physical pressure applied to a surface, which is a different approach than using a wrench to apply a precise force to a specific area. \n5. The choices left are E: as a door stop and answer choice F: to hold large and heavy objects. \n6.

Choices: 1. Upstream 2. Downstream 3. Against the tide 4. With the tide 5. Against the wind\nRationales: A body of water refers to a water source of any size. It's usually defined as the area of water that the tides affect, and it does not refer to all the land features that touch or surround it.\n\nTo figure out which way a boat can sail or which way a person on land can walk on a beach, you have to think about the current of the water or air that you are on. The correct answer will always be directly against or with the current.\n\nFor the body of water:\n\n1 & 2 represent the direction of the current as you're driving your boat on the water. \n\nA.

If you can answer this question without seeing any teeth in the question, you're doing pretty well. Think about teeth, not like in humans, but like a set of chompers. The idea is to think about how many teeth an animal has at its disposal. If you really don't want to go on Google Image Search for \"animal teeth,\" you can at least put the mnemonic together: MOUSE: 12, 000...or more.\nBecause you already got to MOUSE, all that's left is the rat, because it's smaller than the mouse. We're not talking about number of teeth per milliliter, but the teeth itself: there are more toothbuds on a rat than on a mouse. And there are more total teeth on a rat than on the bat, even if you take into account a bat's long \"finger\" teeth. A rat, then, would be your answer.\nAnswer: B: Rat\n\n\n### 4x6 = 3 x 24; 5x3 = 15x2; 4x5 =2 5x 9 = 4 8\n68 = 36; 98 = 54; 58 = 208  8 9 x 3 = 6 9 9 x 5 = 18 1 99 x 8 = 100 8 99 9 = 450 8 9 99 99 \n9 = 05450000\n\nInput: a) What is the length of four times", "answer": " 9"}

Choices: \nA: at the top of the dome\nB: between walls made out of glass\nC: between walls\nD: between dome and the roof\nE: nowhere\n2. First, we must decide what the question is trying to find out. \n3. What do we know about dome architecture? \n4. A dome is a rounded structure supported by a circular arch or ribs and usually topped by a hemispherical skylight. \n5. Thus, the question is asking about the location of the sunlight that might enter inside a dome. \n6. This can happen in two ways - as mentioned above, there can be a skylight directly on top of a dome, or the outside of the dome can be covered in glass. \n7. In both cases, the location where sunlight enters the dome will be between certain borders. So, there cannot be sunlight nowhere.\n8. If there is no skylight on top of the dome, the most likely place where sunlight will enter is between the walls and the dome. \n9. This is because the walls will form an outer boundary that is different from the inside of the dome. 10. So, the only correct option that supports this is C: between walls.\nAnswer: A (between walls made out of glass),C (between walls),D (between dome and the roof)\n\nInput: In the ocean, where will you find octopuses?

Choices: 1: the sailors lose balance 2: they lose power 3: they don't see the sun 4: they fall in to the ocean\nRationales:1. This is where elimination can help us determine the possible answer.\n2. We start with the first option - _The sailors lose balance_\n3. This is not a logical answer to what would happen if the mast broke. It is not an outcome of having to use the ship without the mast.\n4. The next one to be eliminated is _They lose power_ because it has no relation to the question.\n5. All the other options (3, 4, & 5) can be eliminated because they do not make sense from the given question.\n6. The answer would have to be something that would be logical and occur to the crew.\n7. Answer: Answers C is the correct answer.\nAnswer: A C: They lose balance\n\n\n*Note:*\n\nTo understand the meaning and use of elimination you must first become aware of the logical rules in language. Some examples:\n\nThe verb \"to sit\" is used with the noun \"chair\". But it is not used with the noun, \"table.\" To sit on a table is not logical.\nThe pronouns \"who, \"which,\" and \"that\" are used with personal nouns. But they are not used with names of places or animals.\nPronouns referring to people include \"he, \"she\" and \"they\". But they are not used to refer to groups or things. The word \"they\" is sometimes used for groups or things. The correct word here is \"it\".\nAll of this makes a difference in determining what is possible and what is not possible given one or more statements.

{"text": "possible to find a broken keyboard there, it's not the most likely location for this purpose.\n7. Choice E, \"office,\" is the best answer because offices often have broken, discarded or unwanted items. They could easily have a broken keyboard, and they are probably not discarded as soon as they are broken. \n8. In addition to being a place where obsolete or unwanted items are typically kept, offices can be easily accessed, and they likely have other electronics in addition to keyboards, making them a plausible but remote and somewhat indirect match for the question.\n9.

A: Mouth B: Ears C: Arms D: Hands E: Stomach\nRationales: (Based on Intermediate Reasoning):\n\n1. The prefix \"baby\" means recently born, so the baby is less than one year old. If he/she is less than one year\nold then he/she is likely too young to speak. \n2. The question only asks what part of the body can \"make\" or \"create\" a baby talk, so this is a problem to\ndeduce since a baby does not make sounds by their own\n3. A: Mouth and B: Ears answer choices are incorrect because they can't create a baby talk. \n4. D: Hands and E: Stomach cannot create a baby talk either, since they have nothing to with a baby (i.e.,\nbabies can't create stomach babies). \n5. This leaves us with the answer C: Arms which can create a baby talk since the arms of a baby can be\nused to make sounds. This is also correct because no other answer choice is correct also.

Choices: 1 B: A 2: B 3:C 4:D 5:E 6:F\nRationales: Step 1: The question is asking whether there are more or less trees in the woods today compared to many years ago. \nStep 2: The possible answers are B, C, D, E, and F. Each answer is a comparison of the number of trees in the woods today and at some point in \"the past,\" which is implied by the question by calling it \"many years ago.\" \nStep 3: To begin, we can eliminate any options that contradict the question or are unrelated to the discussion. \nStep 4: The first two options are A and B. Answer A is that there are fewer trees in the wood today than there were in the past, but this contradicts the question. \nStep 5: B is less and does not indicate an increase. B is also eliminated. \nStep 6: Choice C states both that there are more trees today than there were in \"the past\" and that the amount of trees hasn't decreased. This also contradicts the question.\nStep 7: Choice D indicates that there are fewer trees today than there were before, another contradiction. \nStep 8: Choice E claims that things are more the \"same\" today and at some point before, which also contradicts the question because the question is specifically asking about the difference between the present and the past. Thus, E is eliminated.\nStep 9: Only F is the correct answer. F is true because option F is stating that there are more trees now than before. \nStep 10: Choice F is the answer that corresponds to \"there are more trees in the woods now than there were before.\"\nNote: While there are", "answer": " 58"}

Choices:  A) The bus driver was not afraid to beat his steering wheel.  B) The bus driver was rashly beating his steering rack.  C) The bus driver was driving unsteadily.  D) The bus driver was beating his steering vigorously.  E) The bus driver was mercilessly beating his steer wheels.\nRationales: The word beating itself does not have a definite number and so can be read to be singular or plural. In this case a plural noun is required whereas in the original sentence, there isn\u2019t a correct number of items. So the first word that needs to be changed is beating in options A, D and E. This should be replaced with beat as the required number is singular, to which the beating would be plural. The second change comes in the second part of the sentence, where the steering wheel is beaten. This needs to be rephrased to avoid repetition. In C, it needs to be driven, but in B, it needs to be steering which is used in the first sentence. The word ruthlessly also doesn\u2019t make sense in the first sentence where there isn\u2019t any action being described. Therefore, the first sentence should be restated as The bus driver was driving in a ruthless manner. As for the second sentence, the word beating should be replaced with beats because the required number is singular. The driver of the bus was not afraid to beat is incorrect, but the driver of the bus was driving unsteady makes sense and is the best choice. Thus, the best way to rephrase the sentence would be, \u201cThe bus driver was driving in an unsteady manner.\u201d\nAnswer: \u201cThe bus driver was not fear", "answer": " 78"}

Choices: A) banana  B) caramel C) chili D) candy E) cheese \nRationales: The question is asking us to choose foods. The question asks us to choose the food that is more appropriate to eat in the morning than in the afternoon. You can't really combine more than one food item that would fit this description. If I had to choose between banana and chili pepper (or between caramel and candy), those would not be options since both can be served at breakfast or dinner.

Choices: 1: A: buy chips B: C: play guitar D: buy a gift E: F: make popcorn \nRationales: The question asks about watching a pregnant woman's favorite movie, but it also says, \"What would she do then?\" This implies that she has completed the action of watching her favorite movie. So, we need to consider the actions that might follow that, such as eating, playing music, shopping, and making popcorn. \n1. A woman who is prepping for a movie night would need to buy snacks and concession foods, such as chips, popcorn, and candy. \n2. Pregnant women usually want to eat smaller, nutritious meals, but they may still crave specific foods. Snacking on specific foods might help soothe cravings if she's hungry. \n3. In this situation, buying some snacks may be part of the activity of watching the movie.\n4. The question does not explicitly state that the woman needs to cook dinner, which is what is required if a pregnant woman must make popcorn at home to prepare for a movie night.\n5. Pregnant women may play music for themselves or for their unborn child, but this action is unlikely to be required if they're watching a movie.\n6. As the question makes no mention of buying a gift for the child, shopping for a baby gift is unnecessary.\n7. Buying chips requires a pregnant woman to leave her house, whereas watching a movie can easily be done at home.\n8.

Choices: \tA: school B: garage C: office D: attic E: baseball stadium\nRationales:\t1. To identify the correct answer, we first need to identify the intended context for \"find a used soccer ball.\" For a long time, this was a soccer ball. Now, since the world cup was last held in 2018, and FIFA recently announced a name change, this was, technically speaking, a football. Since there are no new footballs left, people have taken to calling them \"used soccer balls\", since this was when they were new. 2. This question is an instance of the \"Where would you go to\u2026?\" question type, with a question stem centered around the act of searching for something used. This is different to the more common \"Where would you find\u2026?\" question, where the question stem is centered around seeing something, or something that is more present in its environment, and will need different strategies to identify the correct answer. For now, let\u2019s focus on the word \"find,\" and consider this question type more broadly. 3. Since we know the intended context (having to find a football), we can start by ruling out other locations it is unlikely to be found. For example, we can eliminate option A's, \"school\", since you generally do not play football there. We can eliminate option B's, \"garage\", since there is no way to easily tell if a football was ever used, and there may also be other materials", "answer": " 27"}

The answer is C: wood\nRationales:\n\n1. Water tanks, lamps and walls are not typically considered \"strong\".\n2. The fire could have brought the walls down but it wouldn't have been sufficient to completely destroy the building.\n3. If lamps and tanks were used to support the roof or walls, then there would have needed to have been several of them placed in specific positions in order to support the building.\n4. In fact, \"water tanks\" and \"lamps\" are the same item. And their use in and of itself does not make a building \"strong\", regardless of how many are present in a building.\n5.

The author never said that he took them to the tire store.\n\nSecond off, the question gives no context regarding the character's finances so having the character take his car to a tire store is probably a stretch, and it doesn't provide any information to what the book is actually about.\n\nThe author doesn't mention any garages. If they were an option, they might be reasonable.\n\nThe book does not give any mention of a hospital or garage.\n\nNext we have to figure out where they're saying they got it replaced, which is a car.

Choices:  C: underground A: under a cloud B: in a cloud D: at surface\nRationales: When a tornado forms, there needs to be a large pocket of low air pressure at the surface to force the circulating air to break away from the surface and move downwards, underground.\n\nThis cannot happen in a cloud, as a cloud produces a pocket of high air pressure at the surface, and clouds generally do not break away from the surface.\n\nUnderground, under a cloud, and at the surface are not reasonable possibilities, as a tornado is not possible where there are no clouds moving above the surface. \n\nHence, the answer option is C: underground.", "answer": " 10080"}

E: Frogs\nRationales: Birds: A frog spawn are not similar to bird eggs in that most of the eggs laid by birds are laid in an egg chamber and hatching only happens once the eggs reach a certain age/size.\nReptiles: Reptiles don't lay eggs that are born at full development (like mammals), they lay a number of soft-shelled eggs that hatch into young reptiles that have to grow into mature adults.\nMammals: Like birds, most mammals do not lay their eggs and the young are born at full development.\nFish: Like reptiles, fish do not lay eggs that are born fully developed. The fish eggs hatch into baby fish and they grow inside the body of the mother fish and only later does the young fish leave the eggs and become an adult.\nFrogs: Frogs eggs are laid in a mass of jelly and are not born at full development. They also do not lay eggs that hatch into fully-developed young (like reptiles and birds do).\nTherefore, the only animals that lay eggs that are born just like fully grown mammals are Mammals (Option C). \nAnswer: C: Mammals\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer questions by replacing the question mark, if necessary, and including new material as indicated in the parentheses.\n\n### Directions:\nInput: (Why are there bears in the rainforest)?

Choices: 1) It absorbs it. 2) It passes it through it. 3) It rejects it. 4) It evaporates it. 5) It excretes it.\nRationales:\n\n1. We should first understand the type of question asked in the question. To eliminate the choice, we will need to consider how the body processes alcohol, which would describe what happens in the case of absorbing alcohol.\n2. This rule out options 1 and 3, which describe the ingestion and rejection, respectively, of alcohol, not its absorption.\n3. We can eliminate option 4, which describes the process by which alcohol evaporates, not its absorption into the body.\n4. Considering options 2, 3, and 5 that describe actions that take place after alcohol is in the body, we can eliminate them because absorption is not considered after this stage; it must come before.\n5. We can then confirm that the correct answer is option 5, which is the only choice that is not physically impossible. So, the answer is 5 - Excretes.\nAnswer: 5 Excretes!", "answer": " 20"}

Choices: \t A: Go to the bicycle shop B: Go to a bike park C: take your bike D: Go to a car mechanic shop E: use tools\nRationales:1. It may seem that one of the best ways to get a flat tires fixed is to go to a car mechanic, where trained professionals can fix it much faster than you probably could. But the question isn't asking where's the fastest way to get it fixed, so that choice may seem valid on the surface\n2. However, the question only asks what the best way is. So if that makes you consider it more as a subjective answer then you can eliminate this choice with those that don't fit with that criteria.\n3. Once that is done we can find a different way to solve the problem and make the elimination of the remaining options clearer.\n4. Once they are all the clear, eliminate any answers that is not the best way to fix a flat tire.\n5.

The question makes it clear that the only acceptable answers are units of measurement, and the answer should be a precise volume unit rather than units that represent general volume. As such, distance cannot be the answer since it cannot be expressed as volume.

Now let's focus on what a person should do if someone offers them a computer. (c) is incorrect since \"checks thoroughly\" is ambiguous. What exactly is being checked and who is doing it?\n10. (c) is also incorrect because running slowly may mean that the system is working. (c) means to see if the computer is running properly after viruses have been removed. (c) has been checked thoroughly already. (b) must also be considered to be the correct answer. A person should check to see if the laptop is running slowly and, if so, repair it to fix that problem. To do so, they would need to thoroughly check (check it thoroughly to see) and they need to be sure not to ignore it. The full answer is (c) and (b ).\nAnswer:", "answer": " 27"}

Choices:  I. on the side AII. on the roof II. through the window III. through the tube B. through a hole in the frame C. on the tire D. on the back wheel E. through the cables\nRationales: Identifying the choices:\n\n1. In this question, we can break down the information provided for context and the answer choices to find where on a bike you would shove an elbow.\n2. Since it is asked as \"Where\", the answer would be on a bike.\n3. Similarly, \"on the bike\" would refer to a part of a bike itself as opposed to where you put it, and is redundant in the question.\n4. Likewise, \"through a tube\" would probably refer to a part of the bike and not the whole of it.\n5. This leaves us with the following list of choices: II. through the window, III. through the tire, IV. through the tube, V. on the tire, VI. on the roof and VII. on the side.\nIntermediate Reasoning Stepper:\n\n1. Through the windows is not an option because if we were to \"shove\" our elbow through it would be more than likely to break the whole window rather than just the area our elbow will shove through. Furthermore, it seems illogical to say that you shove your elbow somewhere.\n2. Through the tire is also no longer an option since it sounds like a pun, making that not a real choice.\n3. Through the tube: this could be through the brake cable, the fork or any other small tube where there is enough space for an elbow so this choice can be eliminated\n4.

He was laying tile 3. He was renovating 4. He was making sandwiches 5. He was making a work bench\nRationales: First let us understand the concept of a level.\n\nA level is an instrument used for checking/ aligning horizontal lines such as in building walls, shelves, door frames, window frames, etc. It is used to ensure accuracy and stability of the surface and to prevent any bending/ bowing.\n\nNow, we can apply the concept above to the question.\n\nWe need a level to check/align walls. \n\nHowever, walls are generally horizontal so, if you were installing cabinets, you could probably get away without a level.\n\nWe don't need levels for laying tile or making sandwiches.\n\nSimilarly, we are not renovating.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is 'He was installing cabinets'.\n\nAnswer: A: He wanted to install cabiners properly\n\nInput: At the end of every party the guests would like to clean the _____.

Choices: 1. A: it must be closed 2. B: it must have three sides 3. C: it must contain angles 4. D: it must contain angles greater than 90%\nRationales:  1. The question explicitly states that the key feature of a triangle is its angles. A triangle is not a single angle or three angles in general but rather the closed figure that results when three angles are joined. Since the features of the figure result from the triangular arrangement of the angles, the feature itself is derived from the angles; hence, a triangle is a close-ended shape defined by angles.\n2. The correct answer is B: it must have 3 sides. It is a characteristic of the triangle that defines the triangle.\n3. A closed figure is defined by a line (boundary), and a polygon (in this case a triangle) by side and angle. Therefore a polygon must be enclosed or closed by some line, be it a path, boundary, side, or side and angles. \n4. The question does not make sense as D: The correct answer and the statement D: the triangle must contain angles greater than or equal to 90 % is not the correct answer for the following reasons: \n   1. The statement is confusing and can be ambiguous. What does \"contain\" the greater than or 90% angles? The angles themselves or the figures they form?\n   2. Greater than or equal to 180 degrees is equivalent to 180 angles. The question states \"must contain\". This implies that all angles are contained in the triangle to make it complete.\n   3. Therefore, the following triangles cannot be considered complete triangles:\n      (1)  ABC, where A, B, and C form two angles of 180, which are contained by B (half angle), and C (full", "answer": " 210"}

Therefore, the answer must be one of A, B, or C. Out of those three, only choice B: landfill is the only one that fits the bill.\n9. The only other choice that fits is D: thrift store, as it's possible to have a broken keyboard that is not too old and still functioning but not necessarily at the top of the priority list.\n10.

A: supermarket B: train station C: dentist D: bathroom E: gum shop\nRationales: The question is \"Where is the best place to FIND chewing gum?\"\n1. The key words here are find, which means it's important to look for it.\n2. We know from this that we must look for it, rather than take or purchase it.\n3. So, while a store that sells chewing gum or a dentist selling dental gum may be a good places to find chewing gums, they are not the places that chewing gum is best found in.\n4. You're not just selling chewing gum at a dentist, your selling gum that helps improve dental health.\n5. In a chewing gum shop, chewing gum is the main product, but it is not the main focus as you'd find in a dentist's office.\n6. If you are looking for chewing gum, you must be looking for chewing gums that you will use later, not for dental purposes. \n7. Therefore, you will find the widest variety of chewing gum at the grocery store or the supermarket.\n8. If you are looking to find the best place to buy chewing gum, then the dentist or gum shop might be good options.\nHowever, they are not the best place to find CHEWING gum. \n9.

C: pet shop D: bakery 3. E: restaurant\nRationales: This question refers to a sweet that is a common Halloween treat: toffee apples. \n1. Let's start by considering a candy store, which would be the logical place to find toffee apples since that is their main product.\n2. However, a candy store probably wouldn't carry a toffee apple, since the treat is usually found in Halloween-themed packages and they don't usually sell these items.\n3. A grocery store could also carry something like toffee apples, but they don't sell them exclusively. \n4. A bakery could sell toffee apples in some circumstances, but they are rarely found in bakeries.\n5. A pet shop is a strange one to consider for toffee apples; it's certainly possible that pet shops sell treats for pets, but they probably wouldn't sell human treats. \n6. A restaurant, which usually does not sell candy, could be a strange place to find a toffee, but it is possible. \n7. A restaurant is where the toffee apple is usually found, so a restaurant is the answer choice.\nAnswer: E restaurant\n\nInput: Which of these was used by a group of inventors to create a battery?

The options provided in the choices are not the correct responses because they do not adequately address the location or conditions under which frogs are able to hide. \n\n2. The correct answer is \"C: cave\" because it is the only choice that describes a suitable hiding space for frogs. Grass may provide some cover but is not necessarily ideal for hiding, while rocks are too exposed and easily seen.\n\nConclusion: To answer the question, it is necessary to recognize that the location where frogs hide should be a suitable shelter from predators and should not leave them open to detection. The answer is \"C: Cave\" because of the shelter offered by its dark, damp environment.\n\nInput: where are all birds not from? Choices: 4. A: Africa 5. B: Arctic 6. C: Antarctic 7. D: Europe 8. E: South America\nRationales: For this question, the key to finding the right answer is to identify the locations that are excluded. This can be done by noting the presence or absence of specific types of birds within each choice. \n\nFirstly, examining Choice A (Africa) yields key clues. Africa is primarily home to many types of birds, such as the ostrich, bustards, guineafowl, vultures, falcons, cuckoos, eagles, and pigeons; however, no mention is made of any birds that are not from Africa. \n\nThis leads us to Choices B-F, in which bird species specific to certain areas are described.

Still, you must choose B: landfill as the only remaining answer. \nInput: Where did you keep your pile of dirty laundry? Choices:  a: trash b: closet C: shelf D: backyard E: trashcan\nRationales: The question is asking about where you might keep a pile of dirty laudry. \n2. A trash can is a container for waste, not a place to store something.\n3. Closets are places to store clothes; they are not a good place to keep a pile of laundry.\n4. Similarly shelves are not good places to keep laundry because they are primarily for organizing clean clothes.\n5. The backyard is not usually the best place to keep laundry as it is exposed to the elements and pets.\n6.

A: school B: daycare C: university\nRationales:1. The question asks where the young lady goes. \n2. If it were to say \"who\" the answer would be a person, not a place.3. This means we should think about places where people go.\n4. \"University\" is definitely not associated with learning math, and does not make sense with the \"school\" and \"daycare\" options to rule out.\n5. This leaves us with two choices: \"school\" and \"high school\". Although both are places where students could go to learn math, the question specified the \"young lady\" must be going, and only \"high school\" is a place where an \"elemtnary school\" would go.\n6.

No. A piano is always stationary. Yes. A piano has both a string and percussion instrument Yes. A piano is a hammered instrument\nRationales: There are several logical reasons why a piano is a percussion instrument. \n1. The piano is constructed with hammers that strike the strings when the keys are pressed. \n2. When the keys are played, the hammers hammer the strings and cause them to vibrate and the sounds are created.\n3. This makes sense because percussion instruments are defined as musical instruments, such as drums, xylophones, gongs, etc., that are played by being struck or scraped by the performer.\n4. Therefore, it would make sense for a piano to be classified as a percussion instrument since it operates in a similar way. \n5. Since the answer is no, and there are no other options to consider, we should take a closer look at the incorrect answer.\n6. Answer choice D: Yes, a piano is a hammer instrument, is not enough to validate the question.\n7. A percussion instrument is not just any instrument, a percussion instrument needs to be defined as a musical instrument of that type.\n8. Therefore, it's clear the correct answer is B: No. A piano is made so it is stationary and is not a hammered instrument.\nAnswer: B : No. A piano is stationary and is a stationary instrument.", "answer": " 2"}

Choices:  plant B: pineapple C: tree D: palm E: fern\nRationales: The key to this example is understanding the full hierarchy of biological organisms.\nYou may recognize that plants like palm trees (Option E) belong to the family Palmae, a family known as palm trees. \nYou can find many examples of palm trees if you look for them in the wild (option C).\nTree, on the other hand, describes the shape, or even the trunk, as in our palm tree (Option C).\nHowever, a palm tree is not a tree (option D).\nSimilarly, palm fronds do not have trunks - the trunks are used as supports for palm trees, which are palm trees.\nAs there is no hierarchy, if we look at other examples of biological organisms, we can easily find that palm trees are angiosperms (plants), which are more popular in the tropics than elsewhere in the world. \nPineapples (option C), on the other hand, cannot live in the tropics as they are very cold. \nFor this reason, they are not palm trees.  In general, palm trees can be found in both hot and cold climates due to their ability to regulate temperatures with their fronds and leaves. \nHowever, palm trees are only one type of plant, which means they are not angiosperms (options B and D). \nSince palm fronds can never grow without trunks, they cannot be classified as plants either. \nIn general, if a frond is a tree, it will have a single stem that is not a support for a tree. \nThis is only true of angiosperms, as plants are not animals, so plants can only have 202401653254", "answer": " 3"}

In this case, the context helps distinguish the differences between the three choices that might share some features, but not enough. 1. Choice A: it revolves around the Sun  : This is a good indication that it's a planet and indicates that it orbits the sun, but doesn't necessarily rule out other possibilities, like a moisture dome or other geographic feature with planetary-like characteristics.\n2.

Choices: A: a fruit B: a salad C: a container D: a spoon E: a vegetable\nRationales: The question asks us what we can't have without when we make a fruit salad. It means that the answer has to be part of the process of making a fruit salad, not of a fruit salad itself.\n\n1. So let's start with eliminating answers that are not part of the process of preparing a fruit salad, like answers C: a container, D: a spoon, and E: a vegetable.\n2. What we are left with are A: a fruit, B: a salad, and C: a fruit salad.\n3. We can cross out options B: a salad since that's part of the process of creating a fruit salad. This leaves us with A: a fruit and C: a fruit Salad.\n4. Now our choices are A: a fruit and B: a fruit salad, which we notice don't differ from each other except that A: a fruit refers to the fruit(s) used in making a fruit salad. And it is what we need in order to make a fruit salad, so we can rule out B: a fruit salads.\n5. Choices C: a Fruit Salad, which refers to the finished product, and C: a Fruit salad, which refers to a process, are redundant.\n6. So the correct answer is A: a Fruit, and in case the question mark confused us, the answer does not change if we add an E: it or an A: a Fruit salads since we are not dealing anymore with a process but with a product.\n\nAnswer: A: a Fruit\n\nInput: What do you do in order to get a cashier's attention at a store?

Choices:  a. they were being shipped b. they would be used by a fire department c. they were going to rest d. they were going to a home\nRationales: One explanation is that the stairs were going down due to gravity. Gravity is a natural force that causes objects to fall, and the stairs were likely made of a material that allowed them to fall. Alternatively, the stairs could have been going down for a specific reason, perhaps because they need to access a lower floor. This explanation would be supported by the fact that stairs often serve to provide vertical access from one floor to another.\n\nInput: What is meant by the saying, \"A picture is worth a thousand words\"?

Choice B: by tracking his feet steps is not possible as this is the type of investigation that takes place after the burglary is finished and the perpetrator is on the move.\n3.

Choices: \n A: ocean D: coast\n B: seashore E: beach coastline\n C: shore\n Rationales:\n\n1. It's a common understanding that \"sea\" is an expanded name for the ocean, and shells often are found on beaches, so the answer would most likely be \"the ocean\".\n2. However, this is not the only choice available, and it's possible that a beach could have a larger collection of shells than an ocean.\n3. This is why all the choices were included and need to be taken into consideration.\n4. After carefully analyzing each choice, it is discovered that Choice D: coast is the only one to refer to a shoreline region, which must be a coastal region.\n5. Since there's no \"ocean\" choice, we should consider whether the shoreline is on land or, sea.\n6. The only options that could possibly be considered would be Choice E: beach or B: seashore. \n7. Beach is most likely a beach on water, and it states that there may be beaches, which indicates more than one can be found. \n8. This implies that the majority of the shells are from a beach on water, rather than from a shoreline on coast.\n9.

Choices: \nA: kitchen B: living room C: bedroom D: backyard E: bathroom\nAnswer: B: Living room\n\nRationales: The question implies that the room where the chihuahua is located must be a room where it is possible to interact with and observe the dog.\n\n1. First let's cross off any rooms that the chihuahra could not occupy or is generally difficult to catch in. These options would include the bathroom, which is not a typical place to find a chihuahuap or a backyard, as they aren't typically kept outside.\n2. Next we can eliminate all the options except the living room and the kitchen, as these are some of the most common rooms in a house. A chihuahua could be found in either of them.\n3. Finally, based on the way the question has been interpreted, the chihuahahua must be located in a room that is occupied by a human.\nThis helps eliminate the bedroom, as most adults aren't likely to have a chihuahau in their room.\n4. The kitchen and the living room can both be used by humans while they are interacting with a dog.\n5. Also, a chihuahahaha is unlikely to be found in a kitchen where humans are cooking, while it is likely to be found in a living room where a person would just be relaxing.\n6.

Choices:  a: parrot b: cockroach c: crow d: falcon\nRationales: A parrot is a type of bird, but if somebody saw a parrot in the desert, it would need to be able to tell what the bird was based on the specific desert environment, since many different types of birds could survive in a desert. Similarly, all of the other answers describe a type of bird, such as a crow, rather than just being a generic way to describe birds in a desert.

Choices:  a: their arguments A: their money B: their views C: their beliefs D: a debate champion\nRationales: Since a debate is a formal event in which opinions are discussed and argued, debate teams generally disagree about ideas and issues among themselves. \nFor example, the Democrats would debate against the Republicans in the hope that they can convince the other side on the other party's views.\nIn contrast, a debate champion is someone who wins a tournament and is declared the winner by the decision of judges.\nTherefore, \"A: their money\" is incorrect since money is not shared between members of one team.\nSimilarly, \"B: their views\" is also incorrect since it refers to opinions and views, which are not shared between members of the team. \n\"C: their beliefs\" are views so it also refers to things that are shared with one other, and hence is also incorrect.\n\"D: a debate champion\" is the winner of a tournament since there is only one person who wins the battle when members of the teams debate against one another.\nHowever, since there is only one winner, the winners do not necessarily need to share their views with other members of their team, and hence \"D: a debate champion\", is also incorrect.\nThe only correct answer is \"A: their arguments\", which refers to something that is shared between members of the debate team. The choices \"A: their arguments\" and \"D: a debate  champion\" are the only viable answers since their arguments would likely refer to opinions, views and beliefs, and therefore, would be a thing that is shared among members of the team.\n\nAnswer: A: their arguments\n\n### Demonication:\nTo demonstrate", "answer": " 6"}

Choices:  T: store D: dentist E: dental  B: supermarket F: pharmacy\nRationales: First, understand the question being asked. It's asking about a place one would go to get a toothbrush, so we need to decide what's necessary to get the most appropriate answer.\nSecond, determine what is missing. An obvious factor that may be a requirement for an answer is \"for cleaning your teeth\":\nThird, evaluate whether the answer choices satisfy such requirements. As the choice requirements are written in such a way that they are both necessary and sufficient to get an answer, we can immediately tell that E: dentist and D: dentist both satisfy this requirement.\nFourth, determine the best option. In this case, we only have two options, which both satisfy the requirements we defined earlier.\nFifth, evaluate whether this satisfies the requirements of the problem. While dentist is indeed a requirement, in this context, dentist is an ambiguous term and it's not clear where you would go to the dentist.\nOn the other hand, supermarket is very clear and satisfies the requirements in the question. \nThus, the answer is C: Supermarket.\nAnswer: C.

Choices: \nA: having strong opinions B: having higher levels of understanding C: being able to use a microscope D: being highly motivated E: being socially responsible\nRationales: The given word problem requires us to decipher the relationship between the concepts of  having a regular basis of watching television, and which of the following attributes.\n1. As we attempt to identify the choice best matching each of the concepts, we can apply the meaning and the attributes of the given terms and attempt to understand the correct relationship or the association between the terms.\n2. As per Option (E), Television-Watching Regularly is attributed with being Socially Responsible while, as per Option (A), Having Strong Opinions, is attributed with Being Highly Motivated.\n3. Hence, it follows that those who have a regular basis TV Watching, have the attribute of being Highly Motivated, and those with a high degree of understanding of any topic are, in turn, Socially Responsiable individuals.\n4. Since they directly follow the two key ideas of watching TV Regularly, and having High Motivation/ Understanding, it is concluded that the Relationship between having a Regular basis TVW and having High Motivational Understanding is one of Association.\nAnswer: A-E\n\n### Difficulty: Advanced.\n\nThis response can be found in the following links: \n* [English Wikibooks - Word Problems: The Four Types of Questions](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Word_Problems:_The_Four_Types_of_Questions) \n* [Ukrainian Wikibooks - word problems](https://uk.wikibooks", "answer": " 32"}

Choices: A: arms B: torso C: legs D: brain E: feet\nRationales: We are instructed to answer the question \"What is the largest organ in our entire body?\" This prompt suggests that it is correct to focus on the \"whole\" body to determine what is the largest organ.\n\n1. It is worth excluding the limbs of the head as the main reason to do this is because the brain is also the largest.\n\n2. If we can exclude other organs, then we would have enough information to answer the question \"Which organ is the largest in the human body?\"\n\n3. Given that the digestive system is made up of a series of connected organs, an option may be selected as the single largest organ, and while this is also the largest in volume, an examination of the number of cells and the surface area of organs shows that the other options are in fact larger in volume than organs of the digestive system, especially in the largest organ in the body; the skin.\n\n4. As the digestive system itself works to break down and absorb foods, a large volume of water is brought into the skin. The skin of a human is extremely wrinkled and in fact, contains more surface area than any other organ within the body.\n\n5.

Choices:  A b: yes B: no C: yes D: no E: yes\nRationales: Since options B and C say no, and E says yes, one possibility is that this is not a yes or no question. Given one of the teams must have the answer as yes, we can rule out options A and B as impossible answers. The other three answers, then, need to be examined.\nOption C says no. If the last bump happens off of the net, it doesn't mean that the team has won. It can mean that they are one point closer, it can mean that they've lost one point, or it can even be 0-0. The last bump always counts toward the team's score, but if it happens off of the net then the score is determined by factors other than that bump.\nAnother possibility is that the question is about how the final bump happens relative to when the ball is actually serving. If that is the case then a bump off of the net is an automatic kill, regardless of what other factors contribute to the final point total.\nFor this specific wording of the question, however, the answer is D. This choice answers whether a kill is counted if the final bump happens off of net. If it does, then this is true.

Indoors: This suggests that the phenomenon being observed is something that occurs inside a building or other enclosed space.\n2. Rain: This implies that the phenomenon is related to rain or water in general. In other words, it might be raining or related to a rain storm.\n3. In the Clouds: The clouds could be above a scientist observing something indoors (inside a building or other enclosure), or the clouds could be seen from the indoor location. Either way, this suggests that the phenomenon involves or involves viewing something in the clouds.\n4. In a boat: This option implies that the phenomenon being viewed is something seen from a moving vessel on a body of water\u2014a boat or ship.\n5. Outdoors: This option is similar to \"in a boat,\" since it refers to something observed outdoors. The fact that it is described as \"outdoors\" indicates that the phenomenon is either not indoors or that the outdoors is not rainy and is not taking place in clouds or on a boat. The question doesn't state that \"outdoors\" has to mean a place outside the scope of those options, but it's still a good clue that those other options may not be viable.\n\nGiven these pieces of the puzzle, a reasonable deduction may be that the phenomenon involves rain and is being observed from a moving vessel (boat), either outdoors or indoors.\n6.

First, let's define how \"after\" and \"before\" can be defined. By looking at the number of hour-stamps, we can tell that after 5 means that the alligator will be seen after 5. Therefore, we now know what all possible times the alligator will appear are: 2001 through 2059.\n2. To simplify this, for every instance where the numbering is 0, we will simply write - and every instance where it is 50, we will write.\n3. Next, let's determine the minimum interval at which an alligator could be seen. By subtracting 20 from 2000, we get that an entire year could go by without ever seeing him. We conclude that after 2001, 000 would become a more acceptable minimum interval.\n4.

Choices:  D: farm field E: garage F: pasture G: workshop H: driveway\nRationales:\n\n1. Farmer's inquire about the view of a landmark while they are in the car going over a bump\n2. It is impossible for a tractor to drive onto a piece of property, such as a driveway or garage,\n3. The car is probably in the farm field. The rest of the choices have logical reasons for not including a car but none of them contain a driveway.\n4. The tractor is driving into a garage (C) so it is impossible to say that the tractor is driving anywhere.\n5. The rest of the answers do not have sufficient information to explain why a tractor would leave an area\n6. This eliminates the possibility that the farmer would walk a tractor down the road in the opposite direction or leave it in a field.\n7. You would expect someone to walk down a driveway or into a garage not the opposite. It does not matter which field or even garage because it is impossible that the tractor is still driving anywhere.\n8. Since the car has gone farmer decides to follow it.\n9. The car is in a driveway because farmers do not go into or out of a driveway while in the car.\n10. An answer might be a driveway because farmer is getting in the car and leaves. However, a farmer will only leave a driveway in his or her car not the opposite direction into a driveway by walking.\n11.

Swimmer 5. Wobbly\nRationales: This can be done in a couple of ways.\nThere are two ways to solve it. The most efficient way is to first convert the question from paragraph form into a list:\n\n- When the caves floods only one creature survived: fog jumpy swamper swimmer wobbly\n\n- There are 5 creatures in the list. The first is fog, and is therefore the correct answer. This can be verified by looking at the question, and it tells us that the answer is one creature, which leaves us with 4. 1st option fog.\n\nAn alternative way if you don't want to do the transformation above is to eliminate two options from the question.\n- Fog, Wobbly, Swamper, and Swimmer are mentioned in the question. The question mentions that \"only one creature survived\" but it also states that there are 6 animals, implying that 5 are killed.\n- So it is safe to assume that Swamper and Swimmer are the ones that are left from the list - this helps narrow down choices to answer from.\n\nThis is what we get when we eliminate the 4 creatures from the question - one is left, fog. We don't need to do the transformation of the question to get the answer.\n\nAnswer: One of the six animals is left from the question - Fog.\n\nInput: What are the three common properties of stars?

E: 100km/h\nRationales: The bicycle can travel at any speed up to 55 km/h.\nThe bicycle can travel any speed exceeding 55 km/hr, but, before achieving 80 km/h, it can also reach 88 km/hr.\nThe bicycles can only travel a speed of 80 km/hr.\nAll the speeds are possible for the bicycle because you can\u2019t break the speed limit; only a bicycle can exceed it.\nThe speed limit of the bicycle and a bicycle is 100 km/h, a limit set by law.\nThe questions require more than 1 correct answer.\nSolution 1 (1b, 3b, 4b, 5c): The 1b and the 3b choices are correct. A bicycle can travel faster than 55 km/hour, which makes the 80 and 88 km/ hr options wrong. A bicycle, in comparison to other transportation, has a slow speed limit.\nSolution 2 (1-3C's): The choices of C's are correct for a speed limit greater than 55 but less than 80. The options 3a, 4b, and 5c for the bicycle cannot reach the first limit and will never go past the last limit.\nSolution: (1-3c's, 4c, 5d'): All of the bicycle speed limit choices are incorrect.

Choices: A: specialist B: professional C: technician D: patient E: technologist F: supervisor\nRationales: Choice A: specialist, is not accurate as to what a doctor is. The word \"specialist,\" refers to someone who specializes in and focuses on a particular field of study, skill or talent.\nAs such, a doctor would not be considered a specialist in the field of medicine.\nThey would, however, be considered a professional, as they are well-trained, skilled and have expertise.\nA technician is a person that has specialized skills as opposed to skills of a general nature related to the field in which they are working\nA patient is not defined as a \u201cdoctor\u201d as it is a person (most often a person receiving medical treatment)\nA technologist is not defined as a \"doctor\" as it is a person that works with technical systems like computers and other equipment.\nThe correct answer choice is: B: professional\n\nInput: the main use of a carpet bag is which of the following? Choices: A. A bag where carpets are carried. B. A bag where clothes are carried. C. A bag carried in a car. D. The bag is to tie a carpet to the floor. E. Where carpets are held.\nRationales: The correct answer is option B. This bag is called a carpet bag because it is used to transport carpets and other similar materials. \nThe fact that it can also be used for clothes indicates that it can be used for other purposes, making it a general-purpose or multipurpose bag. \nAs such, the word \"bag\" is used to describe the item.\nSince options A, C and D either contradict the previous definition or are not applicable for a bag, these are therefore incorrect.\nOption E is the only one remaining, since carpets are not held in the bag but are carried in the bag, however, if the question said \"where is", "answer": " 38"}

Choices: 1 of 1 A: zero B: 1 C: 2 D: 3 E: 4\nRationales: The question refers to 6 different words that each have a specific vowel sound as a part of their makeup. The vowel sound can be either a long or short sound, but we do not indicate such distinction in this question. The question is about the number of words that have a vowel sound component; if a word has vowel sounds at both the beginning and the end of the word, then that word count as 1 word that has a vowel sound.\nInput: How many of the words in italics in this question has a vowel in it? Choices: 0 of 1 A: 0 B: 1 C : 2 D: 0 E: 3\nRationales: Input: The question refers to the 6 different words that have a component vowel in them, which could be either a long or a short sound. It is asking how many words in italics have a vowel in them. Since the vowel sound can be part of the beginning or the end as well, every word in italics have a long or short vowel sound. If a word has a vowel sound at both the beginning and at the end of the word then that number counts as 1 word that have a vowel in it.

Choices: 1: urinate\n2: eat A: walk 3: wash hands B: breathe C: shower D: wake up\nRationales:\n\n1. Every human does indeed perform these three actions daily, without fail, i.e. every 24-hour period.\n2. Urinating, eating, and breathing are actions that are very likely to be performed by humans in their daily course.\n3. Showering, walking, and waking up are actions that are likely to occur frequently in a day, but aren't strictly required for human survival. \n4. Therefore, the only answer choice that's certain to be performed by every human is every 24-hours are urinating, eating and breathing.\nAnswer: A, B, and C\n\nInput: Where does the human heart lie? Choices: A: abdominal 2: torso\nB: shoulders 3: chest 4: armpit C: heart\nRationales: Human anatomy The human heart is located in the human chest, specifically in the center of the chest between the 5th rib and thorax.\n\n1. The word \"lie\" when used as a verb means \"to have a horizontal position.\"\n2. That position is in the human chest and not anywhere else according to the human anatomy.\n3. The word \"lie\", in that sense, as used in this sentence, is an exact synonym of \"be\" or \"lies\" (\"the heart is in the human chess and not in the human arms\" can be rephrased as \"the heart is in the chest, and not in the arms\").\n4.

A: what treatments have worked for it 2. B: how long it has been active 3. C: when it first manifested 4. D: where the infection is located 5. E: what its source is\nRationales: This is an example of a problem that asks for the relationship between two pieces of information. The question asks us to find out what we can tell about the ailment using x-rays.\nIn order to answer this question, we can begin by stating some logical rules about what types of information would be gathered from x-rays and why.\n1. x-rays allow doctors to see what's inside the patient's body; for example, they can see bones.\n2. x-rays are primarily used for medical purposes and are not generally used to diagnose illnesses like a human illness.\n3. Therefore, we can rule out the first two answer choices, which concern treatments and effects on the patient.\n4. The third answer doesn't indicate what's in the x-ray, so it can be ruled out.\n5. The last choice gives us a lot of information that isn't strictly related to the ailment, and it is a source that can't show itself on an x-ray scan, so it can be disregarded.\nThe last answer still remains. Ailments always show up on x-rays. We don't know exactly what the ailment is, but since x-rays give doctors a lot of information about the patient and the state of their internal organs, we can conclude that doctors can examine x-rays to learn about ailments.\nAnswer: B; that the ailment has already manifested\n\nInput: Which of these options explains why students are not expected to do research to find new information in", "answer": " 15"}

We then read the given options looking for those options that refer to the definition.\n2. In the answer choices, we see some options that we know are soluble fats (carbons and carbo-hydrates), fats (fats and fatty acds) and carbo-hydrogen (hydrogen and amines), but we don't recognize any of them being soluble.\n3.

C: fruit basket D: fruit stand. E: fruit truck\nRationales: First, note that the question is about a pear.\n\nNext, determine what would constitute the \"end\" of the transformation (being cut into two pieces) in relation to its journey from being on the tree to then being cut in two. Since it'll be on a plate at the conclusion of this transformation, we can assume that the \"end\" of this transformation is taking place on the plate.\n\nSince the transformation is taking place on a plate, the last thing before the two pieces of the pear were cut was it being taken off the tree. Therefore, the transformation between the tree and the plate is the most important part of the transformation, so we want to identify, where was the pear before it was taken off the tree?\n\nThe answer can't be in the fruit basket, because that doesn't make sense logically. If it's so close and related to the fruit basket, then the fruit basket should be the location in the transformation. \nThe fruit stands are probably too far removed from the start and transition to the end of the transformation.\n  The fruit tree is too abstract of a location and doesn't make sense as an answer.\n  The fruit truck is an unlikely spot for a pear to be when it is being cut into pieces, since it's so far away from the end of the transformation, even in the same location as the fruit store.\nTherefore, the answer must be the fruit bowl.\n\nThe correct answer is A: fruit bowl B.\n\nRationales: The pear had already been in a fruit bowl and then ended up", "answer": " 10"}

Choices: A: tube B: tube type of body C: plexus tube D: plexus body E: cylinder body\nRationales: The question asks about the segmented body of an earthworm, which suggests that the body is segmented and not a single solid structure.\nThis supports the answers that describe a segmented body as being, for example, tube-type or hollow.\nHowever, there are also potential misconceptions that must be discarded to find the correct answer.\nA cylinder-type body may be segmented, but it would not describe an earthworm because it does not have an anterior and posterior end like an earthworm. Instead, a cylinder-type body includes a continuous and solid tube. For example, a toothbrush would have a cylinder-type segmented body because it contains one central tube that is open on both ends.\nLikewise, a plexus-type body doesn't describe an earthworm since a plexus-shape has lots of branches that look woven or braided. An earthworm is more like a simple T-shaped or tubular structure.\nSo, eliminate the tube-type body and plexus-type bodies.\n\nAt this point, the remaining answer is segmented plexus body.\n\nAnswer: segmented plexus type body\n\nInput: How do we tell if a plant cell is dead?

The answer will need to be one of the given items that could be a container for a basketball.\n1. Music is rarely used as a container for any type of ball.\n2. A desk, like the piano, could be filled with papers and other items and have no use as a container.\n3. Both the piano and the books are stationary and are therefore unlikely containers.\n4. A basketball and a guitar could both be contained in a music case or trunk. \n5. The piano, desk, and books are stationary objects, while the basketball and guitar are both active objects. The basketball could be found in a basketball case or basket on a wall, and the guitar could be found in a case or on a guitar stand.\n6.

These two options are the only plausible options for radio broadcasting. All other options are incorrect. All other options are either incorrect, do not apply, or are not radio-related. While Edison invented the light bulb and built the first movie studio, these inventions didn't influence radio broadcasting. While Bell invented the telephone and was the first person to communicate over the wires, he didn't invent any equipment related to radio broadcasting. While Marconi invented radio technology and wireless radio, those two don't relate to radio broadcasting in any way. The same goes for Alex Bell and Edison. They invented the telephone, phonograph, and record player, none of which were radio-related inventions.

Deposit is a place from where you deposit your money, which is already in possession of the bank.\n3. Cash out is a way to get money from your bank account back in the form of cash.\n\n4. Request in the bank means you ask for the money in the form of cass.\n5. Answers B, E and C are correct. B : refers to withdrawal where you take some cash from your bank.\n\n6.

B: Heteropteran 3. C: Arachnid 4. D: Hymenoptera 5. E: Diptera\nRationales: The question specifies a particular subset of insects; it's asking us what type of insect is this group referred to as and not the actual name of individual members.\n1. An insect could be simply named that as its name and thus no special designation of type. However, the answer cannot be an insect because insects are a much larger group of animals.\n2. A: Heteropteron is not the name of an insect group as it refers to a specific order of insects. So the answer cannot be a. \n3. Similarly, a heteropter is not the name of a group of animals as it is a specific species of insect. So option B: Heteropterom is also incorrect. \n4. A: arachnid is not an insect; it's a class of animals including spiders; hence cannot be answered by option C: Arachnid.\n5. A: Hymenoptera is not the name of the group; it is indeed a type of insect that belongs to the group whose name we're looking for, but still it is not the name of that group's type. Therefore, choosing D: Hymenoptera as the answer is incorrect.\n6. However, E: diptera refers to a type of insect that belong the group whose name is being looked for.

Anarchists III. Catholics IV. American Imperialists V. Filipino Nationalists VI. Local Traditionalists\nRationales: The question is asking which group was mostly responsible for the 1898 Uprisings in the Philippine. \n\n1. The first 4 choice are non-relevant as the question specifically stated that its about the 1890s Uprisings, not other Uprisings that might have occurred after the American intervention. \n2. The Filipino Nationalists are the obvious choice based on the given information, but it's still good to support your answer. \n3. In addition to knowing that the Uprising are attributed to the Filipino Nationalists, it is also true that the Nationalists were the ones fighting for the Independence of the Philippines as they saw Spain as an oppressive power that was trying to maintain control in the Philippines for the sake of economic interest instead of for the betterment of the Philippines. \n4. The American Imperialists as the other option is out of context based on the question.\n5. American imperialism is seen as a policy where America controlled other countries with various means, ranging from political to economic control, but the 1893 US Philippine Colonization, in which America acquired the Philippines, is the first time where America took formal control of a foreign land. \n6.

Choices:  A) lisp  B) slip  C) plip  D) splash  E) drip\nRationales: First, understand the question and eliminate any options you know directly don't rhyme with stumble. \n\n1. There are no other words that rhyme with stumble in this sentence, so rule out B)slip, C)plip, D)splash, and E)drip. \n2.

Note that only options A, B and D make sense. You can eliminate C and E, since it is not possible for a bus to pass a bus stop on the same side for the second time.\n2. B makes no sense because the driver is the only entity that can \"pass a stop\" in this context. The bus did not pass the stop on the same \"side\" of the bus, but simply passed the exact same stop on the way to the second stop\n3rd: 1. Consider the options: A: It was not on same side of bus the second time B: The bus lost tracking of stop C: The driver was asleep D: It was not schedule E: The driver was driven at high speed \n2. All but option A make sense. A is a red herring because the only reason a bus can take a longer amount of time to reach the next stop is if it stopped somewhere.\n3. The fact that they have already passed the stop at the next location makes it impossible for the bus to still be there, implying that the driver was either driving too fast or was sleeping while driving, since there is no other logical reason that the bus could have already passed the next stop, yet not have arrived at it yet.\n4.

Choices:  Hint: it is an instrument used in a concert. Choices: A: concert B: guitar store C: studio D: home E: band\nRationales: The following hints were given to help with the task: The instrument is used in a concert. This means we should look for objects that are used in concerts or performances. Additionally, it is important to note that the word \"instrument\" is not being used in a specific sense. It could refer to a musical instrument such as a guitar, a medical instrument such as a stethoscope, or a scientific instrument such as a microscope. \n1. A concert/performance often involves music and an instrument, such as a guitar, is a common instrument used in concerts.\n2. Therefore, a logical choice of an environment/place where an electric guitar is commonly used would be a music concert or a concert hall.\n3. In this case, a performance is a type of concert, and this makes \"Concert\" (Choice A) the most logical answer.\n4. Although guitars can also be found in a guitar store (Choice B), a concert hall is probably more likely to have electric guitars.\n5. The term'studio' is also a possible choice, perhaps referring to a recording studio. \n6. A recording studio is usually not used for a live performance, although sometimes they are; in which case the studio itself may host or have electric guitars in them. \n7.

A man who walks around the street topless - with just his torso exposed - is not an appropriate thing to see in public.\n3. These people are often arrested by police when seen in urban areas.\n4. A clothing store can sell clothing, but you don't usually find topless men on the racks.\n5. A man who walde around shopping in a mall with only a torso is not a typical sight.\n6. It's more likely that you would find topless men in a hotel, as they can roam around freely.\n7. In the outdoors, you would be more likely to find men who're in the shower or soaking in a pool.\n8.

In this question, the variable is \"how much money\", and none of the option values can reasonably be considered an answer to the question. \n2. Since we have the answer choices b: enough, c: little, and d: enough + little, we know it must be the second word that is the correct number, and it must be plural.\n3. It is then obvious that the answer choices should be c: little and d: enough +  little.\n4. Since the values of c: little and d :enough +  little are equal, the one that is plural (d :enough +  ) is the correct one.\n5.

Choices: \nA: the opposite fence B: ground C: the air D: across the fence\n\nRationales: The answer should be D, it does cross the fence as it flew across towards\nthe boy who threw it. The word \"across\" implies that the hat flew across the\nfence. The words 'in the air', 'in the ground' and 'opposite fence' mean that\nthe hat does not cross the fence.\nRationale 2: Another sign of correct answer is that in the question \"where did it fly\",\n\"fly\" signifies that the hat crossed the fence, therefore the correct answer D is the\nanswer.\n\n\n\n### What did the student write after completing the work?\n\n\nChoice:  A: that we did everything that was assigned B: hey, I can do this C: thanks, now I understand D: done!\n\nRationale: 1.

The question is specifically asking whether there is more mass in a pencil than in a pen when they are exam.\n2. Both objects are made up of a variety of materials; one can break down the materials to look at mass-to-mass proportions, but this is not necessary because the objects are meant to be in comparison to each other. \n3. We know that an object's mass is defined in grams and kilograms and that an object's total mass depends on its chemical composition.\n4. In this context, a pencil will have more mass than a pen. \n5. Pen (mass): 0.2 g - 1 g / Pencil (mass): 0 g - 0.8 g\n6. Therefore, pencils are composed with greater mass, which is the reason they have more mass than the pens. \n7.

Choices:  P: north C: south I: east Q: downstream G: upstream W: seaward E: riverward\nRationales: Note that the first letter of each option indicates the directions of the answer choices. Intermediate Reasoning: 1. The river and ocean are at the very back of the boat.\n2. The boat is traveling from the river into the ocean.\n3. The mouth of a river is the place where the river opens into the ocean, where the ocean begins.\n4. This means that the mouth of the river is at the opposite end of the boat from the ocean.\n5. When the river meets the ocean, it begins to flow in the direction of the ocean. Therefore, \n6. the answer is E: riverward.\nAnswer: Counter-clockwise; riverward\n\nInput: In a country with a total area of 4.7 square miles, there are 2.7 million people.

In the second part, it was asked how many years and days she lived - that implies she will continue to live.\n3. Given this, think of what would have happened to Winnie if she ate a taffy.\n4.

Choices:  Waste generated during production or manufacturing process; 2. waste disposed from households 3. industrial waste generated during production 4.waste disposed from households\nRationales: Answer- 11. Waste generated during production process \n\n1. Waste generated is not a form of waste at all.\n\n2. Waste generated from households is definitely not waste, since it is waste generated and therefore is not waste.\n3. Industrial waste generated during production is definitely not waste.

Choices: 1: A: with the help of the sun 2: B: from the edge of the night sky 3: C: from the east 4: D: into the east 5: E: with the help of darkness\nRationales:\n\n1. In an astronomical context, the sun \"rises\" when its light reaches Earth, after it has traveled a full day's orbit.\n2. \"With the help of darkness\" doesn't make sense as the dark time of day is when the sun disappears, so we can cross that off.\n3. \"With the edge\" makes sense until we think of the difference between \"from\" and \"with\", meaning we aren't dealing with the edge so we can cross that option off.\n4. \"From the east\" refers to the direction in which the sun moves in its path, which gives it a geographical location rather than a direction. This is not what the sentence is asking, so we must cross out that option.\n5. \"Into the east\" means the same thing as \"from the east.\" In other words, it's geographically wrong. \"Into the west\" and into the north would be other ways of saying the same thing, which means we should go on to the next option\n6. It's possible the sun \"rises from the east\" but it certainly doesn't \"rise into the east.\" \"Into the east,\" and \"into the west\" mean that the sun isn't rising at all, it's setting, which is incorrect for the question.\n7.

Choices:  C: dry A: melt B: freeze D: damp E: soften\nRationales: Initial Reasoning Steps\n\n1. We know from the prompt that the food is being heated in a microwave oven. We also know that the food is leathery, like peeling.\n2. Thus, the right way to begin the question is to decide what kind of peeling is being discussed: skin or food. \n3. A: dry: We know that dry doesn't mean \"dry-looking\". We already know the food is peeling, so we know this option is not the best fit.\n4. C: melt: This option describes what would happen to food while it's being cooked, namely, turning from solid to liquid.\n5. We know what's not happening, so we can eliminate B: freeze and E: soften, since these would be the opposite of melting.\n6.

Choices:  a) he knew that cups of tea don't need coffee filters b) he is planning to add sugar to the tea c) he prefers coffee filter over tea strainers d) he thought that he needed a coffee mug and not a cup\nRationales: The question states that the narrator is going to make tea, so he has both tea bags and coffee filters on the counter. This tells us that the goal is to prepare coffee for the narrator.\n\n1. The tea bags would be used to make the coffee. Because tea bags are used to make the coffee, they should stay on the counter after the narrator starts preparing the coffee. This is further shown when the narrator wonders why he has both coffee filters and coffee bags at this stage.\n\n2. Since he used the coffee bags for the coffee, and they must stay on the counter, there is no reason to remove the coffee filters at this stage.\n3. Coffee is made in a filter because it prevents the grounds from falling into the coffee. This helps keep the coffee's color and flavor consistent.\n4. On the other hand, tea doesn't benefit from using such a filter. Since tea is made in a tea strainer, it does not collect any particles.\n5. This eliminates choices a and c.\n6. This also means that the narrator doesn't need to remove coffee strainers because he is making tea, not coffee.\n7.

Choices:  Q: quill pen T: textbook R: notebook W: vowel\nRationales: The word 'quill' is a single word, but, without a hyphen, it is a compound word. This means that the correct answer must be the word that is missing the hyphen.\n1. A quill is a feather, but a quill pen is a feather with a sharpened point that is typically used to write with ink.\n2. The word 'quill pen' would appear on a list of writing tools, but would not include the word 'quill' because it is the name of the tool.\n3. Choices 'T' and 'R' indicate the beginning of the second list of words. This indicates that the first list already includes 'quill pen' on it.\n4. In the word list, the only option that would start with 'w' is 'waist'. However, as the second letter must be 'r', this is a non-option.\n5. This confirms that the correct answer is 'quill pen', which would be missing the hyphen when it appears on its own.\nAnswer: 'quill pen'\n\nInput: What does an elephant eat regularly?

Choices: 1. Nothing 2. Melted gold 3. Sticky mess 4. Solid gold 5. Battery acid\nRationales: Initial Reasoning Steps : 1. An oxidizing agent is a substance that causes oxidation, i.e., when metals are taken out of their elemental state or broken down to form compounds.\n2. Battery acid is a strong oxidizing agent.\n3. Iron is an element present in steel.\n4. Gold is an element.\n5. Steel and most other metals have a different elemental state to that of pure iron or gold.\n6. Steel would not normally be oxidized by battery acid, unless it were already in its elemental state. If battery acid is mixed with any of the other ingredients, the resulting substance is likely to be something like molten steel which is usually a liquid.\n7. Given that this is a metal reactions reaction, the oxidation will involve both metals. The oxidized iron will be iron(III) or Fe3+ in scientific notation, and gold will be gold(III) or Au3+, in the same notation.\n8. Mixed with battery acid, these atoms will react to produce both Fe2+ and Au2+, as well as H2 and O2. \n\nHence, the substance produced will have components that are solid gold and liquid iron oxides.\n9. While the substance might also form iron acids and various gold acids, the presence of battery acid is strong enough to produce more of iron oxide than any of the acids formed.\n10. Consequently, the reaction will produce solid gold and molten iron oxides.\nAnswer: 1.Melted gold", "answer": " 21"}

Where C is the circumference, r is the radius, and \u03c0 is the constant 3.1416.\n\nInput: Let us first determine the radius of the circle by dividing 10 by 2, which gives 5. We know that radius = r and the radius of the circle below is 5. Let us substitute the radius of 5 in the calculator.\n\nInput: The formula will calculate the circumference, which tells us that circumference = 2\u03c0r\n\nInput: Then, substituting the radius of 5 with 2\u03c0, we get 2\u03c0r = 10\u03c0.\n\nInput: Since circles can never be larger than a square, we then simplify the equation to circumference \u2248 25.\nAnswer: Answer is 25.\n\n### Question:The answer to the above is 25. If you were to ask the teacher to explain, what would they tell you? Choices:  a: it's the radius * pi b: it was an oddly shaped circle c: it's the value given at pi division d: it's the number that we were looking for\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The question asks if they would tell you what the answer means.\n2. However, there's only one option that actually explains the meaning of the answer: D: it's the name of the number that we were given.\n3. Radiuses aren't the name of any number, so that's definitely not correct.\n4. Oddly shaped circles aren't a thing, so something that is shaped oddly isn't the number that we were seeking, so that's also incorrect.\n5. All of the other choices", "answer": " 19"}

If it was a choice, it could potentially be one of the answers.\n7. Likewise, by looking at E.B.E.D.T. we know it stands for tablet. A tablet can be one of the answers for the acronym but does not meet criteria such as it is a machine, not handwritten or a communication tool. Thus, E: table does not meet this requirement.\n8.

A sentence containing a word or phrase that \"means\" something is essentially asking you to use a dictionary and it is, therefore, unhelpful when the definition requires an explanation. 2 is incorrect because it does not contain any meaning. A sentence containing a single word or a phrase of two or more words that does not have a definition is usually incorrect. 3 is incorrect because \"luck\" has two possible meanings that are relevant but not particularly helpful to the context of the sentence - it could mean \"good fortune\" or it could mean \"a fortunate occurrence\" and the sentence is not contextually relevant to explain the difference. 4 is incorrect because it is simply the name of the person referred to in the sentence and, therefore, is not a description or explanation, not an answer. 5 is the best answer because it says both \"happily\" and \"satisfactorily.\" Each of these modifiers tells you that \"luck\" was a \"fortunate occurrence\" which is the only explanation that is helpful to explain the context of the sentence \"The king was out of luck.\"\n\nComment: Just a nitpick:\n\nThere is also one other way to evaluate, that is by noting if the task can be evaluated by one or more steps, if so are they independent of each other and if the answer lies in one or more of these steps or in any one of them, or it follows the steps one by one...\n\nComment: In addition, it would be better to include the reasoning step number and a short sentence that explains the steps at the bottom.", "answer": " 35"}

The answer must be something that lets you look up into space.\n2. The options here contain some possibilities, but they have a lot of other contextual relevance and don't just have to do with looking up.\n\n3. \"lens\" is something you use to focus and see an object. Lenses can also produce an image (like a camera lens). This is not a common way you would be asked to use a lens.\n4. \"starry sky\" could refer to something you see, like a sunset, but that is not what is being asked.\n5. You could use a \"planetarium\" to look at the night sky, but this would be less useful for this question since you could easily see the night sky in a planetarium.\n6. \"Solar eclipse\" is something that happens at a specific time in a specific place. You don't have a permanent way to see it at any given time (though using a telescope could potentially provide a way to see a solar eclipse).\n7. \"Starlight\" is something that doesn't just allow you to see the night sky. Starlight is the light emitted from stars. You could use starlight as a lens or in a telescope, but that is not a common word used to describe such objects.\n8. Thus the answer is option D, \"telescope\". \n\nAnswer: D: telescope\n\nInput: What would you find in a piano?

The questions asks about the first place a person will travel to, not about the first destination they arrive at. \n3. In a journey, a station is a place between departure and arrival, not a destination. Departures and arrivals are typically at airports or bus stops. \n4. However, in the context of a journey or trip, a destination is the final location where a person arrives at their journey, travels from at a station, is the last place on the journey before arriving at their last destination.\n5.

Choices: 1: A: paper\n2: B: rope\n3: C: feathers\n4: D: keys E: birdseed\nRationales: Birds are intelligent animals that can learn how to escape a cage through a small opening.\nFeathers, though light, are also soft and easy to pull away, allowing birds to use them as leverage to escape the container.\n\n\n\nRather than trying to prevent this, people create more secure cages by using key lock systems, which contain the birds and prevent them from escaping through holes.\nHowever, the cage is still permeable and can allow feathers and other materials to pass through while restricting escape of the occupant.\nTherefore, options C: feathers and D: keys will also be suitable.\nIt is only birds who eat and can digest the tougher seed material that will need birdseed, so an animal eating birds needs to be considered as a possible owner or manager of the cage.\nThere is no way to conclusively tell which birdseed should be used, but options B: rope and E: birdseed can probably be ruled out on the basis of not being food and D: keys can be discarded as it requires the owner to be present to access the keys in the event of the bird attempting to escape.\nFor option B: rope and option D: keys the animals would probably need to be trained early in life so must be capable of being taught this.\nHowever, option C: feathers is a natural method of escaping which requires a degree of intelligence rather than training, so option B: rope must be eliminated.\nTo the extent that the animals are intelligent,", "answer": " 11"}

It's an ant, so the answer must be related in some way to the behavior of ants.\n3. Consider the terms, purpose and ant. What type of thing does an ant do?\n4. A behavioral description of an ant is a \"task,\" e.g., \"to move food.\"\n5. It is unlikely that \"to kill\" could be considered a purpose of ant as there is no specific task or activity that it implies. Hence, answer choice \"kill\" is not plausible.\n6. Same for the answer choices \"defend\" and \"breed\".\n7. Of the remaining answer choices, \"move food,\" \"eat\" and \"build homes\" could refer to activities that ants do, but a home or dwelling is a space or structure.\n8. A home or building is not an ant, so an ant's activity or behavior can have a result but the activity itself can't be the ant's purpose, as discussed in previous steps.\n9. If ants eat, it's what they do, which is similar to how you eat and that's what you do, just like an ant eats.

Choices: 1. at home 2. in a museum 3. in a car 4. at work 5. at the gym\nRationales: What the question is asking here is what can be considered as the most likely place for a damaged phone to be found.\n\n1. The reason why home has been discarded as a possible answer option is that phones in homes are usually handled with care and are not frequently dropped, smashed, or broken.\n2. Museums do not typically receive enough phone traffic to warrant their inclusion as an option.\n3. Phones in cars are somewhat more likely to be involved in accidents or damaged, however this is not typically where people lose or damage phones in the first place since most do not drive with their phones in the car. It's more likely to lose the phone while leaving or entering the car, rather than be involved in the crash of the car (especially since people usually take it out before getting in the car).\n4. At work- this can be an option as an office might have quite the number of phones, of varying quality, and many of them might be lost or damaged. \n5. At the gym- this can still be an option because gym equipment does not come in a variety of quality and since some people lose their phones when trying to run or do high-intensity exercises, \nsome of the phones might be broken or damaged. \u200b\n6. Therefore, it can be concluded that of the 5 options, there are 2 that are good potential answers- 1st and 5th.\n7.

Choices:  a: with gas b: without windows c: black d: with seats e: all of the above f: no roads g: no air bags\nRationales: Step 1: Initial Thoughts:\n\n1. Cars originated in the 19th century but became widely used during the 20th century.\n2. This suggests cars were made at some point, so the question is asking about how cars were initially made or designed.\n3. Option A: with gas, is not accurate. While cars have always had an internal combustion engine that required some form of fuel, the gasoline that cars currently use was not available until the mid-20th century. \n\nStep 2: Eliminate Options:\n\n4. This leaves us with six options.\n5. The answer must be a feature of cars at some point in the past.\n6. Option B: without windows, is too vague. Cars may not have had windows in the 1980s, but this would not be the best answer.\n\n7. Likewise, \"Without fuel\"\n20 may not have been an option back then.\n8. We also have Option D: with seats. While cars did have seats in the past, it doesn't specify if it's a requirement of the question.\n\nStep 3: Make Best Choice:\n\n9. This leaves us with three options.\n10.

{"text": "unlikely you'll find a brand-new keyboard there, you may encounter more broken keyboards because they're more common in that environment since they are usually discarded rather than fixed or replaced.\n7. Choice E, \"office,\" is a place where you could also potentially find a keyboard, but again, it may not be a broken one. However, as offices often need various office supplies and equipment, it's more likely to have more broken items compared to other places because offices tend to repair broken items until they're no longer functional.\n8. Therefore, the answer has to be D: thrift store or E: office, both of which can both offer a higher chance of a broken keyboard than other choices.\nAnswer: D,E: office, thrift store\n\nInput: If you look at a map and a globe, what does a dot represent? Choices:  Choices  A: point B: space C: location D: area E: distance\nRationales: First, look more closely at the options -\n\n1. \"Point\" refers to a very small spatial location.\n2. \"Space\" is a generic word and refers not to any specific type of spatial area.\n3. \"Location\" is a specific place on a map or globe.\n4. \"Area\" refers to a larger spatial location, such as a region or even the entire world.\n5. \"Distance\" is another generalized word. It refers to the geographic distance between places.\n6. Therefore the correct answer must be \"location\" or \"area\".\n7. Both \"area\" and \"location\" are correct answers, and both denote a spatial entity. However, the correct answer is \"location\" based on the requirement that the dot is a place on a map or a globe, not a general region or the entire world which could be referred to as an area.\n8. So the correct answer is \"B: location\".\nAnswer: A,B: location\n\nInput: where does the moon go after it passes the Earth?

Choices:  I: A cow, II: A horse, III: B. Elephant, IV: A. Tiger\nRationales: First, comprehend the question. The question provides three animals and asks which is the correct combination.\n2. There are two possibilities: i. Incorrectly pairing two animals, giving two incorrect pairs. ii. Incorrectly pair an animal and an inanimate object, such as \"dog\" or \"cub\".\n3. Comprehend the options. i. The first choice is I: \"A cow\". ii. Second, \"II: A Horse\".\n4. Third, we have III: B \"Elephant\". Fourth, \"IV: A Tiger\".\n5. The animals that are incorrect here are the horse and the cow, so option I is wrong.\n6. Thus, we can eliminate possibilities \"I\" & \"II\".\n7. It is the pair \"III\" & \"IV\" that is the right one. Therefore, this combination is chosen as it is the right choice.\nNote: \"III\" is not given because it is the \"Cub\" (a young lion), not the \"Elephant\" (a large mammal), that is meant. However, the context of a young lion is implied in the question, so we can say this combination is correct.\nAnswer: III & IV: a lion and a tiger\n\n#### Answer 2: \n1. A cub is a young lion or tiger, a cub is not an elephant.\n2. The choice \"IV: A TIGER\" does not describe a cub at all as lions and tigers are adults.\n3.

It is a living entity that is either too small for us to see or they are bacteria which are not visible to the naked eye. \n7. This means that bacteria are microscopic organisms that are either in their larval form or the adult form.\n8. The answer lies in the question. Which of the five choices do not make sense for bacteria to stay in? \n9. It is B: in the sun - it would cook or starve and cannot live in the warm, burning light rays from the sun for a long time. \n10.

In the question, the phrase 'is inside'  indicates that we need to find the answer to that term. \n8. The sun is not found inside any star inside the galaxy and also, the sun is on the surface of the galaxy, but the ocean lives under the earth.\n9.

Choices: \nA: music store\nB: hospital\nC: school\nD: garage\nE: kitchen\n\n### Rationales: 10. The question is asking about where a torn sock might be found. Considering the context, an option can't be \"music store,\" as musical instruments are not related to old and torn socks, and is likely to be a place that \"sells new socks.\"\n11. Furthermore, \"hospital\" is not a suitable option - hospitals provide a medical service, where an old, torn socks is not something that they deal with.\n12. Meanwhile, \"school\" is unlikely to provide a suitable location, because old and torn socks are not found in schools.\n13.

It's a gift that can be shared with the giver, the recipient, or both. \nA: violin: Although the violin is a beautiful instrument, it is not necessarily the best gift for everyone. \nB: piano: Although the piano offers a great deal of enjoyment and skill-development, it requires a fair amount of skill and practice to get started, which may not be ideal for some people. \nC: organ: This instrument is more technical and requires considerable skill to play well. Growing pains can be significant if the gift-giver does not have an appropriate level of skill and the recipient lacks motivation and patience. \nD: harpe: The harp is very delicate and expensive, so it requires extra care, which may be difficult for some musicians.

In English, this is the order of operations. In this version, \"B: times-divide\" is the correct order.\n2. \"Divide-plus\" is an operation for which arithmetic operations were performed in reverse order, and thus \"Divide-plus-times\" is not the correct order.\n3.

Is it a place in a country or just a place where someone studies science or works as a scientist? The answer is obviously not an academic study of science, which means that B doesn't make sense either.\nNow, let's consider each of the options in turn without considering their meaning.\n\n1. Option A: This choice is obviously science, an academic pursuit. \n2. Option B: Anthropology is the study of human groups, which could overlap with history. This is a reasonable answer, and there is no clear rule that says that anthropology, archaeology, and linguistics cannot be included.\n3. Option C: Linguistics also overlaps with history, but would not necessarily be necessary to understand the history of a country. Similarly, this is a reasonable answer.\n4. Option E: Archaeology deals with material history, including artefacts, and excavation. The answer choice does not specify a country or countries. Therefore, option D: archaeology is the best answer.\nAnswer: D : archaeology\n\nInput: What would a person study in a physics class?

Choices: 1) Because of the long trips. 2) Because of the gas fumes. 3) to prevent break-ins. 4) because its dangerous. 5) a person might get locked in.\nRationales:\n1. The questions asks us why people are told not to sleep in vehicles, such as cars, buses, trucks, and motorcycles.\n2. The question doesn't specify where someone might be sleeping in their vehicle, such as up on the front seat, in the back seat, in the trunk, or even on the ground.\n3. So we're looking for a general answer that applies to an entire car as opposed to something specific to a specific area in a car.\n4. The long trips refers to the act of sleeping in a long journey, specifically where someone may not have a suitable place to sleep at night. There are several reasons for not wanting to sleep in your car while on the trip without mentioning them being dangerous: break ins, crashing, or leaving the headlights on to not be left asleep near an actual car crash.\n5. That leaves us with two options; 3: to prevent break-ins and 4: because its dangerous.\n6. While both options may be valid, option 3: to prevent burglaries is the more suitable explanation of why people shouldn't sleep in their vehicles.\n7. This is because we can't assume that everyone that sleeps in their vehicle does so in the most ideal location which can lead to a break-in.\n8. It's likely that anyone sleeping in a vehicle may not have access to the best possible location.\n9. Therefore, we can safely conclude that people shouldn'", "answer": " 60"}

Choices: 1 A: No, they ended up ill in the hospital B: Yes, they felt better C: No, it just made them more sad D: Yes, they felt much better E: No, they actually became dizzy \nRationales:  1. If you are feeling down, sometimes eating a comfort food helps. However, this depends on the person. For some, comfort food can trigger them to begin binge eating or to develop a habitual unhealthy eating pattern. \n2. So it could either be true that the person who feels sad eats chicken to feel better, or the chicken might actually make them feel worse, by making them gain weight and causing them to feel worse about themselves.\n3. To get to the correct option, the other options must first be eliminated.\n\n4. Option B: No, they ended in the hospital:  - Eating too much chicken could cause some health problems, but likely not so serious that you might get hospitalized, unless the person has other medical complications. For example, eating an excessive amount of high-fat food may cause heart issues, but this is not a hospital-level reaction.  Option D: Yes, they feel better: Doesn't make sense, it is too straightforward, which makes it highly improbable.\n\n5. A person who has a negative emotional state doesn't usually change their state by getting better. To eat chicken (or any type of food), there first needs to be a mental change of happiness or sadness which would be more complicated and not be related to a small incident like eating chicken.\n\n6.

By eliminating options that don't make sense, we can narrow down the choices to A, B, C and E.\n2. Although \"A: above your waists\" doesn't seem related at first glance, it's useful to consider musical instruments and how they are played.\n3.

Choices: \nA: the air expands B: the water gets hotter C: the temperature becomes colder D: the water gets saltier E: the water turns brown\nRationales: Steps:\n\n3. Since the question tells us that ice is melting in water, ice would have the lowest temperature, the water then higher and the water would still have the highest temperature.\n\n4.

From the choices listed we can eliminate any that are not animals or are not mammals.\n2. From the animals listed in the choices: m. moles, it can be determined that the toes on moles are shorter, not longer toes. \n3. c. Geese do not eat dirt. \n4. We are looking for an animal that uses its long toes that are not cows, because cows have cloven hooves, not toes. \n5. The only option left is an animal that is a beaver. The beaver has long toes on the front as well as the back of its paws. 6.

Note that \"divided into\" implies that, instead of being a full single unit with many rooms, the house will be divided into multiple, smaller parts. So the choice describing a single-unit property would be incorrect. \n2. From there, it is easy to narrow down the options that remain. \n3. Option A can be eliminated because it is not specific enough to the question of a house. \n4. Similarly, options B and E are too vague to directly address the question.\n5.

Next, note that none of the remaining options give reasons for choosing such a layout - they simply say how things generally are when the house is that way and why houses often resemble that layout. This is sufficient information to answer the question of the possible reasons for the layout.\n8.

Choices: 1. Their bag would be left behind if it were put into the incorrect airline. 2. The student wouldn't be able to get a seat in the plane that would allow them to sit near a family member they didn't like. 3. The student wouldn' t be able to sleep on flights in a window seat. 4. The student couldn't find the family member they were traveling with. 5. They would have to travel with only one person.\nRationales: First read carefully to understand the problem. The student would be in a situation where they would be traveling to a new place they had never been and with someone that they didn't like at all. It would be a bad situation because no one likes to travel with someone they dislike. But then, consider the five given problem descriptions and determine which of them would produce the greatest difficulty. The answer is choice #4, \"You wouldn't be able find the family member you're traveling with.\" This is different from the other four, which concern physical, practical, or logistical difficulties. This answer would be more psychologically difficult, because the student would feel anxious about where their family member was.

The question asks you to compare the items in order to find which one is found more than its counterparts.\n2. The word \"forks\" is similar to \"more\", making it the word we'll be looking out for.\n3. A \"fork\" isn't the same as a \"spatula\" (i.e., they're not opposites), so we can quickly eliminate \"spatulas\" if we use them to look for \"forks\".\n4.

The sun is the star at the center of our solar system and is usually identified as the largest celestial body that we can see with the naked eye.\n\n2. \"The center of the solar system\" is a logical place to look for the sun, and it refers to its physical position at the center of the solar neighborhood. \n\n3. Eliminate option A: the center of our solar neighborhood. An excellent source of misinformation regarding the location of the sun is popular fiction. In science fiction stories, a planet is typically the central setting, while the sun is seen as a heavenly body that does not have a tangible place within the fictional solar system. This is misleading because in reality, the sun is in the center of our solar neighbourhood.\n\n4.

A reference of calories in other types of fruit (e.g. bananas) that are in similar relative size and that you can use to gauge an orange's caloric content.\n3. The concept of calories as a unit of energy.\n4. A calculator or a paper pencil and ruler tool.\n5. Note that the question doesn't say you must eat an orange to get the total calories.\nHow to do it: 1. Select an orange that's around 8-10 oz in size, which could be a store-bought medium to large orange (as many oranges do not fit in the standard \"medium\" size). For ease of calculation, this can include juiced oranges to keep their weight consistent with a whole, non-juiced orange. \n2. Calculate the calories from other fruits you know have the same relative size (e.g. 140 calorie bananas), and then estimate 1-2 x that value to the orange's calorical value. \n4.

Choices: 1: equals 2, 2: greater than 1, 3: greater than equals 1, 4: 1 less than equals 2, 5: 1 equals 2\nRationales: Reasoning Steps. \n\n1. We can begin with the knowledge that 1 gallon is a greater volume than 1 quart.\n2. We know that when reading a mathematical problem, it's always a good idea to pay attention to the structure of the question.\n3. In this context, the word in question is that of \"Quart\" - which refers to a smaller volume than a \"Gallon\".\n4. Therefore, we know that the word \"Gallon\" has a greater value and volume than \"Gallon\". \n5. When given two numbers, we know that they don't always have an equal value, but are often different numbers. For example, choosing \"62\" greater than \"42\".\n6. Also, choosing \"4\" less than \"12\".\n7. We can also determine that the relationship between certain quantities is equal to a single number, in this case \"2\".\n8. 50 quarts equal 20 gallons, for example.\n9. Based on the information provided, we know that some quantities are equal to each other.\n10. We can also determine the relationship between 1 Quart and 2 Quarts.\n11. By considering the information provided above, we can determine that our answer would be 1: equals 1.\n12. Therefore, 1 gallon equals 2 quarts.\nAnswer: A.\n\nInput: This is the first of this series where the math expression was a fraction. The second example is\n\nX + (Y + Z)/ 2\n\nX", "answer": " 12"}

Choices:  a: no one b: not many c: the elderly d: grandpa and grandma e: it's dead\nRationales: Explanation:\n\n1. Given that DVD players have been significantly outdone by online streaming service technologies such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. \n2. In fact, there are those who would argue that CD players are a more useful technology than DVD players given that they remain relevant, and that there are actually still some stores and services dedicated to the sale and distribution of CDs.\n3. The answer can therefore be selected from choices C, D, or E as either of these would be considered correct.\n4. Choices A and B are definitely incorrect as they explicitly state that this is \"in the year 2020\" and therefore would not accurately represent a DVD player.\n5. Choices C and D are also incorrect because the question does not mention specific groups of people that may be more relevant to use a DVD player.\n6. The only logical choice is C: the elderly given that they rely on CD players and DVD players more than others and are more likely to use them in 2021.\n7. Therefore the answer should be C: the elderly.   \n\nAnswer: C:the elderly\n\nInput: I am a musician, I have a collection of guitars.

Choices:  D: landfills E: case stores F: offices G: museums\nRationales: The question is asking where to find the best quality materials.\n1. The best quality materials are those that are rare, rare or difficult to find and have an excellent aesthetic or other unique qualities. These materials typically have greater value and may cost more than other materials available. \n2. Museums are not the only place to find materials that are considered rare and/or have excellent aesthetic qualities. \n3. This leaves the choices: F: offices and G: museums. Of these two, though, I think museums are more likely to have the best quality materials, since they have a focus on preserving, displaying, and interpreting works of art, often in permanent or semi-permanent collections.\n4.

Choices:  a: ball b: floor c: collision\nRationales: An image will help you identify what you need to understand, if you feel stuck:\n\n![](./images/Ball_Colliding_with_Floor_.gif)\n\n* When the white and red ball collides with the floor, an elastic collision occurs. An elastic collision is one in which all the objects involved in the impact bounce off from each other after contact.\n* When two objects collide, if energy is lost in the collision, it's an inelastic collision and not an elastic collision. In this example, the red ball bounces off the floor without losing energy.\n* Elastic collisions do not always happen while colliding with the floor as they could also happen with other objects.\n* A collision is the physical contact of two objects or more. \n\nFrom these pieces, the logical conclusion is to eliminate the \"ball\" choice since there will always be two objects colliding and at least one of them will be the floor.\n\nNext, \"a: ball,\" \"B: floor\" and \"c: collision\" do not refer to physical objects; they're only nouns without physical meaning to their own.

As for the teacher's instructions, all the elements that describe \"the students need to add the additional material to the essay\" are contained within them.\n\n### Question\nIf you're looking for additional resources, see what Google has to offer:\n- [Common Mistakes (Intermediate)](https://edu.google/assist/commonmistakes/intermediate)\n- [Common Mismatches (Beginner)](https://edu.pinterest.com/assist/common-mistakes-beginner)\n- [Common Errors (Advanced)](https://edu.facebook.com/assist/?error=no_such_page&ref=pb)\n- [Help with Prepositions (Intermediate)](https:/edu.youtube.com/assist?help=prepositions)\n- [How Do You Choose the Correct Verb Form?](https://edu.linkedin.com/assist/-/assist/how-do-you-choose-the-correct-verb-form)", "answer": " 32"}

{"text": "likely you could find a keyboard there, it's less likely to be a broken one because such stores focus on the condition of their items.\n7. Therefore the answer is B: landfill.\nAnswer: B: landfill\n\nInput: Where might you wear a wetsuit? Choices: \tA: pool B: bathtub C: beach D: beach party E: swimming pool\nRationales: Question: 1. The word \"wetsuit\" refers to a special type of swimwear designed to keep swimmers warm in the water.\n2. It typically needs to be worn near or in water, so the question asks where to wear a wetsuit. \n3. By eliminating choices that don't make sense, we can determine that a beach party is unlikely to be the best place.\n4. Someone wearing a wetsuit might attend a beach party, but they certainly wouldn't wear one there in the first place.\n5. Similarly, it makes little sense to wear a wetsui at a place like a swimming pool where you'd already be wearing a wetsui.\n6. Therefore options D: beach party, and A: pool may be eliminated. \n7. It's unlikely to be worn at a bath tub where a person wouldn't be outside unless invited. \n8. The remaining choices B: beach, C: beach party, and E: swimming pool are more likely to be places where one wears a wetsui. \n9. However, beach party takes an even smaller precedent because it specifically states that a beach party is a place where you're likely to be in the water.\n10. Furthermore, \"beach\" is somewhat vague and it doesn't specify if its a place to go into water or just to sit on.\n11. As a result, the answer is C: beach party.\n12.

B is inaccurate in some ways. A bacterium may not always stay in one area and a virus may not always move around.  C is inaccurate as the virus always moves through its host, so it is not true that it is never in one area and it is not true that the bacterium moves through its host.\nAnswer: II: A virus is smaller than a typical bacterium.\nAnswer: D is inaccurate.  This is because the bacterium may move around through its host or not, while the virus always moves through.  The virus does not stay in one area, but the bacterium may or may not.  Thus, a virus can be larger than the bacterium.\nEliminations: 1.

Trashcan: It could end up there as well, but why put a useful keyboard in the trash when there is an option to recycle or repair it?\n4. Classroom: A broken keyboard can end up in a classroom, but not likely before it is broken since it is unlikely that a teacher would buy or loan students a broken keyboard.\n5.

Choices: 1: An image of Venus, 2: The image of an airplane, 3: The image of your friend, 4: Darkness with objects, 5: Stars\nRationales: The question asks what is seen when looking through a telescope so we are looking for the images seen not the item itself. If we use the given example of someone looking through a telescope we should think of what they would be looking for rather than what they can see and be looking at. \n\n1. We can eliminate choices 1,2,3. Venus, a plane and a friend would be seen, not images seen, through a telescope so these are eliminated because they are not what the person is looking for when they look through a telescope.\n2.

Choices:  iPad A laptop B: Smart phone C: computer E: all of the above\nRationales: A iPad is a portable, internet-enabled computer: iPads run on Apple's iOS operating system, which is designed to be touchscreen-friendly, with a virtual keyboard and handwriting recognition. iPads rely on a combination of solid-state storage (storage that doesn't use moving parts) in the form of flash drives and RAM as volatile memory, which is memory that can be lost once the device loses power\nB Smart phones are internet-enabled computers that are used mainly to access the web and communicate with friends. They usually have a smaller form factor, smaller processing power and less storage capability than tablet PCs (tablet PCs are also internet-enabled computers). Because smart phones use a combination of flash drives and RAM, i.e. solid state storage and RAM in order to store information and run programs.

In this case, the dog represents Ness, while the cat represents Nunki.\nFollowing the context, the question can be answered by understanding the rules of pun intended. The rule is that puns are more often not puns. Let's disregard the \"hints\" given and see if it actually makes any sense.\n1. According to the context where did the dog go? To the land where where's no Ness (Nessi)\n2. Where did the land go? To the where (where's Nunki land).\n3. Now, let's see if the hints given, make sense. It makes no sense because it's pun intended.\n4. Let's try to answer again without following the context and hints.

Choices: 5 feet 1 mile 3 miles\nRationales: Understand the scenario, then eliminate choices that are impossible. The question is about carrying items in a vehicle.\n1. The question says that the capacity is \"small\". This lets you know that any van is too large.\n2. If a vehicle can't fit in a car park or garage, then it's too large. The only car mentioned is a small van, so any other kind of van will be too large.\n3.

Choices:  Answers: A: desktop B: laptop C: office D: music shop E: bedroom\nRationales Question:\nWhat is most likely to be found in a place where a computer mouse might be? What does the verb \"find\" mean in this context?\nReasoning Steps: 1. First read the question.\n2. Identify the key term \"computer mouse\".\n3. Think about what computers are used for and where they normally go: in one's office or home (which are places with desks, computers, phones).\n4. From these considerations, the answer is E, because one will most likely find a computer mouse when they go to a desk, which is a place in their house or office.\n5.

Choices: \nA: it gets angry B: it falls asleep C: it passes away D: its throat closes up E: they feel sick\nRationales: The wolfberry is a type of wild berry that is toxic and can cause serious illness in animals who eat it. When it's consumed, the animal will likely become ill, and it is possible to die.  In the question, the animal is expected to get sick (which would be the most likely event). It's unlikely that the animal would feel sick or fall asleep, so choices A, C, and D are excluded. Choice B, that the animal becomes angry, is less likely to happen as a result of eating the toxic berry.

Choices: \nA: closer B: further C: same D: not visible \nRationales: The moon is a natural satellite that orbits around the earth. It is closest to the earth when it is a full moon, which is why you see it on that side of the earth every month. \nWhen the moon is closest to us, earth's gravity pulls it closer to earth than it is when it's further away. \nTherefore, on full moons, the moon moves faster in its orbit as it is closer and subject to more gravity from the earth.\nThus, the correct answer is C: same.\nAnswer: C.

We know someone is having lunch outside of their office, and we are asked to identify who would be likeliest to see them then.\n1. The choice, \"A: old people,\" is unlikely because they would most likely be on a break or going home for lunch at that time.\n2. The choice, \"B: tourists,\" may potentially be there, but for the most part, they are usually there during other hours of the day, such as outside of business hours or at night.\n3. The choice, \"C: children,\" is unlikely as they usually have school at that time.\n4. The same can be said for the choice, \"D: homeless.\"\n5.

To confirm, one has to think about broken items in general. Would you throw away a broken laptop or a broken car? Or would you repair it or take it to a recycling center? The answer choice E: office indicates that even if something is broken, it can still be useful to someone and therefore kept.\n9. This is true only for valuable items like computers and not low-value objects like keyboards. You're more likely to find a keyboard at an office since you can just take it to a dumpster instead.

Choices:  B: living room A: attic C: cellar D: foyer E: den\nRationales: First, start by eliminating the answers that do not describe where a piano is often located. These options include A: attic, since pianos aren't commonly stored there; C: cellar, since pianos don't usually get stored in cellars; and D: foyer, since foyers aren't places where pianos are usually found.\n\n1. Next, consider the remaining choices to identify the best match. \n2. B: living room is the best because a piano can be found there.\n3. E: den is not a relevant answer because this isn't a particular type of room or spot where pianos are typically located.\n4. A: attic is also not the correct answer because even if one were to find a piano in an attic, it's likely to be a secondhand item since it isn't a typical place to buy one.\n5. C: cellar is also not the correct response. Like with an attic, it can be a place to find a secondhand piano but is not where they are commonly found for homeowners.\n6.

Option 1 is inapplicable because the cat is not the source of the tape recorder - the cat has already eaten the tape recorder before anyone came across it.\n2. Option 2 is inapplicable as well, since there doesn't seem to be any evidence that the cat has a bag wrapped around its head.\n3. Option 3 is not relevant because the question does not state that anyone had gone to the bathrooms other than the cat.\n4. This eliminates one of the remaining options: option 4: we heard a taped-recorded message. The flow of information is that the cat ate the tape recorder that was in the bathroom. Option 4 is then inapplicable because it doesn't provide the information why the person came across the tape recorder.\nThe question thus leads to option 5: we heard the tape-recorded meowing.\nAnswer: 5: we heard an recorded meow\n\nInput: how long does it take for a baby baboon to get to grips on its newborn baby?

The obvious answer is S: schools. In schools, there may be many English students studying together.\n2. However, the question doesn't mention'students' and also doesn't mention a specific area of a school or university. \n3. English students may study in areas other than school:\n4. In libraries, for example, to borrow English books.\n5. In clubs, because they like a group activity to enhance their English conversational skills.\n6. In shops, because they could try talking with customers or staff.\n7. In fact, in these days of the Internet, you could easily study English online in a club or shop computer.\n8.

The question only covers situations where a man might be playing with his dog, but not where he is walking fun games with his dog.\n\n4. So, if we consider what places are reasonable to see such an activity while walking, we'll find that the \"zoo\" is the only place where a man might be walking his dog in a casual manner.\n5. However, it doesn't make sense to expect to see a dog at a zoo because the nature of a zoo tends to have different animals.\n6. Therefore the answer must be D: train station\n\n7.

A salon is more about earning tips, not a salary.\n2. Salaries at a bank would likely be lower because a lot of the work there is repetitive, done by a large employee population, and relatively easy. A salon and department store would have higher salaries because they typically rely less on the repetitive, easy work that a bank might rely on and do not have as large of a workforce.\n3.

Choices:  Mr. A: Mr. B: Mr. C: Mr. D: Mr. E: Mr.\nRationales: The question asks who \"Mr.\" represents because it's the first word in a series of related words. As the first word, it should represent the general concept they share.\n1. \"Mr.\" is the informal version of \"Mister\". So, \"Mr.\" represents this honorific.\n2. \"Mr.\" would generally be associated with males as it's the initial in \"Mr. Smith\" which would be the proper form in a title for a man.\n3. \"Mrs.\" and \"Ms.\" represent female and unmarried female forms of the title respectively. However, since \"Mr.\" comes first it would mean that Mr and Ms are associated in this way, and not the other way around (from Female to Mr). \n4. \"Miss\" is considered a young women's title. \n5. \"Ms.\" is a neutral gender title.\n6. It would be wrong to say that Mr and Miss are associated as both would not refer to a woman. \n7. So, since the first of the words in this series is Mr (and we know that generally indicates male gender) it's only correct to say that Miss, Ms, and Mr are associated in this way. \n8.

Choices:  A. cat B. squirrel C. wolf D. duck E. ape\nRationales: The question asks about a specific kind of animal, a \"dog\", that is often referred to as \"dog\".\n\n1. To figure out what a \"dog\" is, we first consider animals commonly referred to as \"dogs\".\n2. A: cat, B: squirrel, C: wolf and D: duck are not commonly referred to as \"dog\", so they can be eliminated. \n3. In fact, the question doesn't make sense if we were to consider these animals to be \"dog\" because dogs and these animals aren't comparable in terms of size or behaviour. \n4. Apes, on the other hand, are animals similar in size and behaviour to dogs so they can be considered. That said, a phrase such as \"an ape is called.. \" is not usually grammatically appropriate, so we need to ensure that phrase. is used correctly. \n5. There are three kinds of \"Dog\" referred to in English and one of them is an animal. A monkey, which is an ape, is more commonly referred to as an \"ape\" than \" dog\".\n6.

Choices: \tA: park B: forest C: concert hall D: office E: warehouse\nRationales:\t1. We start by selecting an answer that can clearly be ruled out. \n2. It's obvious that option B: forest could never contain a piano because you couldn't possibly find a piano inside a forest. \n3. Similarly, we eliminate A: park. Parks are generally places where people congregate, and if a park contains a piano, it's likely that it's in one of the buildings on the premises. Therefore, the only remaining answer is D: office. \n4. Offices are places where business is conducted, and pianos are common corporate business property. \n5. The phrase \"find a piano\" suggests it's something that has been lost or is currently missing. \n6. Hence, we can eliminate C: concert hall option because in this case, the piano exists.\n7.

What a fence is, can be understood to be a barricade. \"Put out\" here is a reference to the act of building something to block an entrance.\n1. A fence is build to block access.

Choices: \nA: it will dissolve in acidic solutions B: water will evaporate C: a new material will appear D: it will form a gas\nRationales:\n1. First, let's review what the question says. \n2. It says \"add more water to an equal or greater volume of vinegar or baking soda\". \n3. This means that we aren't going to combine two different amounts of vinegar/baking soda and a small volume of water, but rather will be using the same volume of vinegar/soda and a greater volume of water.\n4. From there, we begin asking ourselves the following:\n\t- How will adding more water to vinegar or baked soda affect the solution?\n5. Water is added which can increase its volume or amount. However, when we add more water, vinegar or soda is no longer in direct contact with water, so the concentration becomes more diluted.\n6. Vinegar/soda is very reactive, so a reaction might happen, but nothing is formed as a result.\n7. Vinegar/baking powder reacts with water to produce carbonic acid, which can further react with other substances such as baking soda to create new substances.\n8. The amount of vinegar or sods isn't relevant, as the concentration of the solution is decreased.\n9. The resulting carbonic acid should break down into water and carbon dioxide, forming a gas.\n10. The increased water volume leads to more carbonic acid being produced, which forms more carbon dioxide.\nAnswer: A. it will dissolve in a liquid or liquid solution\nInput: The penguin", "answer": " 13"}

Choices: A: toothpaste B: rice C: pizza D: bread E: water\nRationales: The question asks if an item can be found in a grocery story.\nThe answer is a grocery store, but this is not a \"yes or no\" answer. Instead, of just looking at the words grocery store or not grocery store, it instead asks which items a grocery store has.\n1. There is water, but water does not typically come from grocery stores.\n2. There is also bread, but what we ask if the item can be found in the grocery story does not say anything about what groceries are bread.\n3. Also, water is in this sentence not an item that is or is not in a grocery, it is just a normal feature of the language used.\n4. Pizza is something you might want to make, so it is not found in a groceroy store.\n5. However, since they are often sold in grocery stores, things like rice and toothpaste are grocery store items.\n6.

The correct answer to the question is a letter that is \"on the right side of the \u2018M\u2019\".\n2. To arrive at the correct answer, we should consider the word \u201cright\u201d.\n3. In terms of spatial relationships, \"right\" is opposed to the word \"left\".\n4. Therefore, the letter that should be mentioned is the letter which is on the right side or opposite to the letter \"M\".\n5.

Choices: 20% A: nothing B: half of $10$ C: $2.5$ D: $15.65$ E: $11.57$\n\nRationales: We can quickly eliminate the answers that are absurd or do not make sense: 1. If you buy $1$ worth of meat, you earn nothing as $1$ divided by $1$ is literally nothing. That's what \"nothing\" means, by the way. 2. Divide $10$ dollars by $10$ and you get $1$. That's not a half, of course. 3. If you buy meat worth $10$ dollars then divided by $1$ because you only buy $1$ worth, it is still $10$ because 1 is not in that division, and so your profit is $10$. This is called \"rounding\", which means that if you say that $9/1 = 8$, then $10/10 = 8$. 4. It is clearly impossible to earn $15.6$ more dollars than you originally paid ($10$ to $15.6$). If you earn an extra dollar, then you paid $10$ and sold it for $11$. Therefore, you earned $1$ and it costs $11$ to buy meat when it costs, e.g., a dollar for $10$ percent. 5. The answer is that you earn $1.05$, which is what a $10$ percent profit on a dollar is. This should not be difficult because once again a", "answer": " 322"}

Choices: 1: A: dog 2: B: cat 3: C: elephant 4: D: alligator\nRationales: (Part one) 1. The smallest of the group is called the minnow. We can determine this by eliminating the wrong answers. \n2. A: This is the dog, which is the largest of the group.\n3. B: This is the cat, which is not the smallest.\n4. C: This is the elephant, which is not the minnow.\n5. D: This is the alligator, which is not the correct answer. \n(Part two) 6. Now we get the minnow, which looks the most like the group. \n7. By choosing the next smallest we can deduce the correct answer by eliminating each animal in order, one at a time. \n8. We start with the second smallest. It is either B: cat or C: elephant.\n9. There is only a single letter difference between these two letters, therefore we choose the one with the smaller alphabet, which is C: elephant, as the answer. \n10.

Choices:  (a) brain or (b) legs or (c) feet or (d) head \nRationales: In this question, you must select whether it is the legs, brain, foot, or head that take up the most space in humans. If you do not choose exactly one option, your answer is considered incorrect.\n1. The human body has many parts.\n2. Among which of these parts takes up the most space? This suggests that we should consider the size of the parts, and choose the one that takes up the most space.\n3. The brain is considered one of the largest organs in the human body, which is true.\n4. Therefore, we can eliminate options (b): legs and (c): feet from consideration because they are not considered organs in the human anatomy. \n5. The human head takes up a large space in humans.

Choices:  Vest, coat, jacket, pullover\nRationales: The clothing items in the question are of different types, which can be categorized primarily into two groups, namely vests, which don\u2019t have buttons, and clothes that do have buttons.\n\n1. An outer garment with buttons in front is called a jacket. It is usually layered over other clothes such as shirts, trousers, or skirts. The question clearly mentions clothes.\n2. A coat is a warm layer of clothing, typically in a single piece, which covers the upper body and often has a hood and no sleeves. Coats have buttons on the front, making it the correct choice.\n3. A vest, which is a piece of clothing that is worn over or as part of another garment, usually doesn\u2019t have buttons. Therefore, option Vest will be the incorrect choice.\n4. A pullover is a piece of clothe, typically made of wool, that can be either worn as a shirt or a sweater, and its length either ends just below the knees or above the thighs, like ankle-length or long.

Choices: A: top B: bottom C: back D: front E: both sides\nRationales: Detailed explanation regarding the intermediate reasoning process involved in solving the question: 1. The answer to which side of a piece of bread is easier/harder to cut is crucial as it determines the position at which we will be cutting.\n2. It may be difficult to determine if there's always going to be an order of preference i.e. backside > frontside and vice versa etc.\n3. However, this can be determined using the following set of steps:\n\n4. Given that we're talking about bread and it is circular in shape, the front side and rear side are going to be the same. \n5. Thus, we need to determine if the top and the bottom (also referred to as sides in everyday conversation) are similar.\n6. If both sides are the same and don't differ in thickness, then there is no difference in which side is easier to cut. \n7. It will also mean that it will be easier, if at all, to cut from the back compared to the front side. \n8. But if the top and bottom are not the same, we need to determine which of the two is thicker. \n9. If the front side is cut, we will be cutting against a wider surface so this is going to be marginally harder than cutting from the back if the back is indeed thicker. \n10. It should be noted that the difference in thickness will be of the order of millimeters at most rather than several centimeters. \n11. If the front is thicker, there is more chance of the cut being a clean cut, but this can vary across cuts. \n12. This is because if the blade is very sharp, it will go through the tougher backside easily. \n13. However", "answer": " 60"}

Choices: \nA: pens B: paper C: staple removers D: lightbulbs E: computers\nRationales: In order to find what can be bought at the office supply store, we can take a look at the options and determine the most suitable answers.\n1. The question does not specify that the office supply store is a chain store.\n2. Even as a common store found throughout the country, there might still be some stores which only offer a fraction of the mentioned products from the choices.\n3. For example - Some of the office supply stores in the country only sold computers, which would make choice C and D ineligible.\n4. Similarly there are some stores which only offer paper products, making choices A (pens), B (paper), and E (computers) ineligible. \n5. Also, the store may not have lightbulbs, making choice C ineligible.  \n6. This leaves us with choice B (paper) and choice D (lightbulbs) as the only eligible choices.\n7. Therefore the answer is D: lightbulbs.\nAnswer: D : Lightbulbs\n\nInput: Where do people most often read?

{"text": "possible to find a keyboards (or even a broken one) there, it's less common than at a music store.\n7. Choice E: \"office,\" is another place where you could find some broken keyboards, but it's less of a focal point than other options, as it's not as likely to replace broken ones or fix them after repair.\n8. Therefore, if you're searching to find old or broken equipment, it's more likely that you'd find it at a landfill, rather than in an office.\n9. You could also consider \"garbage\" as an option, but that could be a place to find a broken keyboard, as well as a place to find the keys from such a keyboard.\n10. A garbage can is something that holds or contains garbage, which encompasses broken equipment and broken keyboard pieces, as well as other items.\n11. Thus, the answer is B: landfill.\nAnswer: B: landfill\n\nInput: It is inaccurate to state that the moon is stationary. Choices: A: completely false B: exactly true C: very true D: completely true E: somewhat true\nRationales: The question is asking for an accurate answer to a statement about the moon.\n1. It has been claimed that the moon is stationery in space, because it appears relatively static or unmoving when observed from Earth.\n2. However, a thorough understanding of the characteristics of the moon shows that it has a lot of movement and is very inaccurate to say that it is stationary.\n3. It is not completely false, because it does appear to be stationery in space, at least relative to the stationary Earth.\n4. However it is inaccurate because that isn't its true state.\n5. So even though this statement does seem true to us because the moon appears to be stationary, it's still at least somewhat inaccurate to consider it true, and definitely not completely true.\n6. Thus, the more accurate answer is D: inaccurate, which is a slightly more accurate statement about the moon being stationary.\nAnswer: D. It is inaccurately stated that the moon is stationarily \n\nInput: How is the worldwide spread of Covid-19 related to population density? Choices: A: neglig", "answer": " 200"}

Choices: 1) composting 2) burning 3) burying it in a landfill 4) seeping out\nRationales:  \n1. While composting does involve disposing of unwanted kitchen waste in a different way by turning it into a soil conditioner, \n2. it's not cheap.\n3. Buried kitchen waste would not be inexpensive because it wouldn't involve any upfront costs. \n4. Similarly, burying kitchen waste in the yard or garden is not inexpensive as it requires the time and effort to move and dig soil. \n5. Septic tanks tend to cost a fair amount to install and maintain, so that cannot be an inexpensive way. \n6. This leaves us with the two choices that involve burning the unwanted waste: burning it in a fire pit or burning it in an open fire. \n7. There is a cost for starting or preparing a fire. \n8. Burning unwanted kitchen waste could be a cheap solution to the question because there is relatively little preparation or maintenance required.\n9. While there may be smoke, this is common with indoor wood stoves, and could still be inexpensive for those who have access to free firewood.\n10. Therefore, burning kitchen waste in an open fire is likely to be an inexpensive solution for the problem and the correct answer.\nAnswer: 2) Burning kitchen waste. \n\nInput: After all of humanity's great achievements", "answer": " 3"}

So, \"Aeon\" is chosen.\n2. \"Geoid\" is a word used to describe a particular point on the surface of the earth but that name is uncommonly used.\n3. \"Unicorn\" was a mythical animal that appears in children's stories but has nothing to do with our reality.\n4. \"Zombie\" is a word used in horror movies and has nothing to do with students' lives.\n5. \"Omnipotent\" is hard to spell for most people not educated in the technical words of religion.\n\nAnswer: C: omnipetent\n\nInput: Why did moses go back to egypt?

Choices: A: restaurant B: kitchen C: hotel D: cafe E: dish wash\nRationales:1. The question asks where you could find an omelet.\n2. An omelet is a breakfast dish originating from France that has various components, including eggs (often several), other types of cooked or raw fillings and herbs or other seasoning.\n3. Therefore, we need to consider places where omelets could be made and served for breakfast.\n4. A \"restaurant\" would be able to cook and serve omelets for breakfast, so it is a possibility.\n5. A \"hotel\" has multiple rooms that may be rented for the night.\n6. In a hotel, breakfast is typically provided along with the room and often includes an omelet. \n7. A \"cafe\" is a type of restaurant, where people typically go at night and during the day.\n8. Many cafes serve omelets as a choice on their menu.\n9. However, an omelet served at a cafe is not typically made fresh, so it might not qualify as an omelet made at a restaurant or hotel.\n10. A \"dish wash\" isn't a valid option since omelets aren't typically prepared there and aren't typically eaten there.\n11. Therefore, of the choices, the best and correct answer is \"restaurant\". It's a place where you can find (and eat) omelets for breakfast.\nAnswer: A restaurant\n\nInput: Where are most of their homes made?

Prior to that, most people had email using simple pencil-and-paper notes. \nD: Phone is an older communication method dating back to 1876. \nE: VoIP, or voice over internet protocol, is a way to communicate through the internet since the 1980s.\nAnswer: D\n\nInput: What is the difference between a computer and ipad? Choices:  software and hardware A: software and hardware B: hardware and software C: memory and hard drive D: software and memory E: processor and hard drive\nRationales: The terms \"hardware\" and \"memory\" are both types of computer parts. While the terms \"hardware\" refers to physical equipment used in a computer, \"memory\" is a type of storage media.\n\n1. The terms \"processor\" and \"hard drive\" are also hardware components, but unlike memory and hardware, they are components of both the computer and the iPad. \n2. Software, in contrast, does not describe any part of a computer or iPad. It is a general term for any set of instruction or programming that a computer follows to perform or accomplish tasks.\n3.

Is Stronger and D. Is Faster. Children do not usually have more strength than adults and they also do not have cars.\nThe only other choice left is \"longer\" and, by the question, we know that the adult's arm is longer.\nSo you know that the answer is: \"A.

The options remaining are the top of the head and the other is the young fish.\n\nNow consider the meaning of the question. A fish that is not a baby, of course, is an adult.

Choices: 2: the salinity of ocean water makes it similar to seawater.\nRationales: This is a text-based test in which you get one or two sentences of information and you have to determine the meaning of some words in the text.\n1. For the first sentence, we know that the ocean is a salty body of water.\n2. So it contains salinity.\n3. The second sentence says that this salinity, i.e., the saltiness or salt content, makes the ocean's water closely resemble seawater.\n4. Thus, we can determine that the first sentence is true. \n5. In the second sentence, the term \"salinity\" refers to the level of saltiness or salt content in a body of water. \n6. Similarly, \"the salinity of ocean water\" refers to the level or saltiness of the salt water found in the ocean.\n7. When compared to sea water (the water normally found near the sea), the ocean water is saltier, meaning its level of saltiness is higher.\n8. Therefore, the ocean water can be said to be \"similar to seawater\".\n9. This makes the second sentence true. Hence, the entire question is true.\nAnswer: 2: the saltiness of ocean water makes it resemble seawater\n\nInput: In a word, you are given the name and you have to determine what type of word it is?

Suppose choice 1 is true that the person who owns the couch found the key. This statement is not very probable as it is more likely that the person is looking for the keys he/she has lost. Thus, we can eliminate choice 1.\n2. Suppose choice 2 is true that the person found the keys on the couch.

Choices: A: break the laws of physics B: get a license C: apply to the FAA D: be turned on E: push down\nRationales: First, determine the correct wording of the question: You may be tempted to answer using A (break the laws of physics) or D (be turned on). However, to successfully move, a motor needs to apply energy. \n1. The question asks you to choose a verb phrase that correctly states what a motor needs to do to move, indicating it must apply energy. \n2. \"Apply to the FAA\" or \"be turned on\" are not actions that directly apply energy to a motor, so we can eliminate these options. \n3. \"Push down\" is not an action the motor does, so we can eliminate this option as well.\n4. Only two remaining options apply energy to a motor to move.\n5. The term \"Break the laws of physics\" makes sense because the laws of physics control whether or not an object experiences motion.\n6. However, a motor is an object that moves, so it isn't a complete sentence and is therefore excluded. \n7. \"Get a license\" relates to a vehicle using energy from the motor to move. \n8.

We're looking for the place the old folks are living in.\n\n3. We can eliminate places like a retirement community (C) and extended care facility (KE) as they aren't places older people are known to live in exclusively.\n\n4. We also can eliminate nursing (NF) and assisted (LF) living facilities as they aren't normally intended for long-term residency, even if some old folks are living there currently.\n\n5.

When asked about what element is in this bond, this question is asking about which \"element\" or atomic species is present, and the question only states that the question is about a \"ionic bond\". \n2. The general wording in the question makes it clear that the atomic species are only cations and anions.\n3. The presence of any additional species, such as a halide ion, would not satisfy the requirements specified in the question, and hence this species cannot be the correct answer.\n4.

Choices: 1: Hera 2: Athena 3: Minerva 4: Artemis 5: Aphrodite 6: Demeter 6:\nRationales: The most powerful goddess is Minerva. \n1. Hera is known as the queen of the gods, but her power is limited to her control over Zeus' affairs. It's not a complete description of her ability. \n2. While Athena was the goddess of wisdom and warfare, the way the question has been worded implies that power is an important factor.\n3. Minerva is the Roman name for the Greek goddess Athena, who was also called Pallas Athena or Pallas. \n4. Although Minerva, too, was the goddess of war and knowledge, she was a more powerful being than Athena. \n5. Aphrodite is also called Venus by the Romans, and while she is the goddess of love, her power was not always as great as others. \n6.

Perilous can also mean incomprehensible or difficult, but if these descriptions are applied as adjectives they cannot describe a thing in general like the word in the definition can (perilous rock).\n3.

Where is it good to have? Where could you not have it?\n1. Abundance of wealth refers to people with a lot of money or a large quantity of resources. They are also known as the rich or wealthy. Abundance is about having more than you need, enough, a surplus.\n2. If you have a surplus of wealth then you can live in an expensive place, with good furniture, in an exclusive location and be safe. These can all be associated with luxury homes.

A cheetah can beat a hare, but not a cockroach. The horse is stronger than all three but is only competitive with a snake, which can run faster.\n\n2. This question can be answered using the knowledge of various animals. Time is crucial in determining speed, so this should take precedence. For example, whilst a hare may be able to run quicker than a cockroaches, it cannot outlive them. The snake is more durable than all three, yet the horse's superior strength is a major factor that should be considered. 3. If all the animals are racing, it makes no sense to include the hare.\n\n3.

Rocks are large solid pieces of the earth's crust that are used to construct or make a structure of any kind. Rocks might be used in the construction of shelters, but that is simply not the proper definition of the word \"shelter\".\n\n2. Water is a fluid substance (like air or juice) that, when put in a bucket or any object that is able to contain it, will reduce the volume of whatever that object is. \n3. A rock is not used to make things float on top of water.\n\n4. Rocks, depending on their composition, might be a good insulating material, and therefore can be used as a container for making things warm, but that cannot be the sole definition of the word \"container\".\n\n5.

For each condition, use your best judgment to rank them in order of \"most likely\" to \"least likely\" as they relate specifically to getting to the hospital. A: Cookie baking: it can be a bit messy, but it's not likely to cause a real injury (unless you are clumsy with the oven). You won't need stitches, and you won't need crutches. Unless you get sick from the sugar!\n2. B: You'd probably still be OK, but you might need something to put you back right. Perhaps a simple, one-time visit to the doctor might be all that's required.\n3. C: You'd probably have to go to the hospital, because it's just so painful \u2014 you'd need to get it looked at by a doctor. If you broke something, you might need crutches or a cast.\n4. D: The flu is so painful that it will put you out, but you're not more likely than Cookie Baking to go to the hospital.\n5.

Choices: 1. high unemployment rates 2. high interest rates 3. decreases in real economic output Choices:\n\nRationales:\n\n1. For option (1), there is the term \"1980 US RECESSION\" in the question, which means recession only occurred in 1980 (not in 1981 and other year).\n2. For option (2), the term \"high\" means to reach a peak point, then a decrease would follow.\n3. For option (3), the term \"decreases\" means that a decline occurred, which means the answer must be either (1) or (2).

Choices:  D: pencil E: paint brush F: camera G: paint\nRationales: Question is asking for the item used to make a picture.\n\n1. A pencil is definitely an item used to make a drawing or picture.\n2. A camera can be used to make a picture, but only indirectly. You can take a photo with a camera, which becomes a picture, but a camera does not make a picture. A picture is made directly by the item used in the picture, such as a pencil. This means the question will not accept a camera.\n3. A \"finger\" could be used to make a drawing, but not draw or make a picture because it is not an item that specifically creates a picture. It is a body part that can manipulate a drawing.\n4. A paintbrush can be used to make an actual painting, but \"paintbrush\" is not the exact answer to the question because it is something that can make a painting, not a painting.\n5. A paint is an item that can be used to make paintings, but again, \"paint\" is not the exact item the question is asking for -- it is the liquid component of a painted item. A painting that utilizes paint is a painting in its own right, and to create it would require using paint brushes or a paint roller, a roll of paint, or some other item used to make the final painted picture.\n6. Thus, \"paint\" would be incorrect and \"paintbrush\", \"brush\" and \"finger\" are not specific in terms of creating a picture, so the correct answer is definitely \"pencil\".\n\nAnswer: D: pencil\n\n## Conclusion\nThrough thorough and clear reasoning, identify which response best completes the request. \n\n<br/>\n<br/>\n\n<center>\n  <button class=\"btn btn-warning\" type", "answer": " 6"}

E: another vehicle is approaching from the opposite direction\nRationales: Reasoning Steps IMPORTANT: If you are struggling with this question, we recommend reading through the following reasoning steps first since they describe the main steps you will take to answer the question. \n\n1. You are driving down a \"one-way street\" and no traffic is coming from the back, so you want to turn right in order to go back to your original route.\n2. Remember that this is not allowed, which means the answer must refer to why you cannot make this turn.\n3. Consider the options given to determine what is prohibiting you from making that turn.\n4. Note that \"A: there's a\" is not relevant because turn-only signs are not given for the direction of a turning vehicle, and we shouldn't assume any other signs are present.\n5. The remaining options each contain at least one relevant issue, but we can cross out non-applicable options quickly.\n6. \"stopping\" is not involved. It's not mentioned at all nor an issue, so cross it off. We can also rule out the red zone because there's no reason why prohibiting the turn would be the result of its being red.\n7. You're not allowed to turn onto \"a fire hydrant,\" so this is another irrelevant choice.\n8. Another reason you wouldn't be allowed to make a turn is if you blocked traffic for a moment, so cross off the \"other vehicle is approaching from the other direction.\" \n  Note that the \"A: there' question is also redundant", "answer": " 18"}

We're looking to determine what protective clothing protects us from.\n2. Choices 1, 2 & 4 all indicate protection from harm.\n3. Since there is only one answer, we need to look for a difference between the answers.\n4. Choices 1 & 4 both use the word \"catch\" which can mean harm, whereas, 2 & 3 uses the word \"electrocuted\" which explicitly means getting a significant electrical shock.\n5. Choices 1 and 4 have nothing to do with electrical shocks.\n6. Choices 2 and 3 both discuss electrical shocks. This answer choice is incorrect because it doesn't talk about catching on fire or electrocution.\n7. The only answer left which talks about electrical shocks is choice 3.\n8.

{"text": "possible to find a broken keyboard, it's more likely to find a working one that has just been replaced by something new.\n7. We can exclude C and D entirely, so option B \"landfill\" and E \"office\" are the next in competition.\n8. However, landfills do not typically receive and dispose of broken keyboards. It's most likely that this waste is brought to the landfill by someone, who we can assume to be office- or school-related.\n9. Therefore, the most likely destination of a broken keyboard is an office; if we can rule out the choice D and look at what else is left, we can see that the answer options are either the school or an office.\n10.

A office.\n \nInput: The girl put on her make up first to cover up her blemishes and then put it on for the last time to apply blush blotting and a finishing touch. Choices:  A person first  B: Secondly\nRationales:\n\n1. \"Put on her make up first...\" refers to the action of putting on make-up.\n2. Here, we can see that make-up is used in a figurative way in that sense that what's used is not physically applied make-up, but what is \"put on\" is an action that involves the usage of make-up.\n3. The question asks what happened \"secondly\", or next afterward.\n4. This means that the other part of the sentence is \"The girl...then put it on for the...\".\n5. Therefore, it is referring to an instance after the above. The girl first puts on make-up and secondly applies blush blotting.\n6. This suggests that option B is the correct answer choice. \nAnswer: B: Secondly\n\nInput: Which color does ice blue look when its warm?

Choices: \nA. on top of a car B. in the back of a car C. inside a person D. in a bus E. on a truck\nRationales:\n\n1. On top of a car wouldn't work because, although it's possible to transport items by putting them on top of a car, a couch wouldn't fit.\n2. The back of a car may or may not work, depending on the size of a couch. But if it did work, it would require special equipment to secure and load the couch, which can cost extra money or even be banned in certain countries.\n3. Inside a person doesn't make sense, because it would be difficult to walk around with a couch inside your body.\n4. In a bus, while it's technically possible for the passengers of a bus to strap a couch onto the roof, it would require special permission from the bus company due to safety regulations.\n5. It's likely that in most cases the bus company would prohibit the straping of a couch onto the bus, because it would create a safety hazard.\n6. Finally, on a truck doesn't work either, because it's considered unstable or dangerous to transport cargo on the top of a truck unless it is securely strapped down.\n7. Therefore to ensure that your couch arrives safely, there's only one real option: taking it by plane.\n8.

Choices:  B: a cowboy C: lots of noise D: foul smells E: sweet sounds\nRationales: The term \"cow in a pasture.\" refers to a setting where a cow is grazing on grass found in a pasture. \nA pasture is open land where livestock or pets are kept for feeding, grazing, and exercise. \nCows have large bodies and produce plenty of waste, so a pasture where they live would likely make lots of noise and produce foul smells in the process.\nTherefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the answer is D: foul smell(s),\nas the noises a cow may make in a pasture would mostly be nonverbal communication or munching.\nAnswer: D : foul smells\n\nInput: How does it work?

Choices: 1: Clean the house. 2: Watch TV.3: Play video games. 4: Sleep. 5: Write a book\nRationales: The question provides the situation where we want to play 16 hour of video games. There are 50 hours available. What I need to do with remaining time? How long the remaining time is less than 16 hours. If there's more than 50 hours, it's better to choose option 5: Write a Book. Other than that, we can choose option 3: play video games or 2: Watch TV. But there's no need to clean the house just because there's more than the required hours.

Choices:  a: diploid, eukaryotic b: tetraploid, gnucaryotic C: hapolcarp, asexual D: antherozoid, fertilization E: mitosis, mitosis\nRationales:  1. Since the term \"stages\" refers to sequential phases or stages in a process during which progress is made, we understand the question to be asking what steps occur during cell division.\n2. There is no such thing as \"diploid, eukeryotic\", \"tetraploid, Gnu caryotic\", \"haplocarp, asexually\", \"antherozoid, fertilisaiton\", \"mitosis, mitosis\".\n3. Thus, the correct sequence of stages must be \"mitosis, meiosis, mitosis\". Mitosis is the first stage of cell division and the other two are also stages of the process.\n4.

Mitosis is the replication of DNA so that genetic information can be distributed to daughter cells \n2. Therefore, we can begin to eliminate answer options which don't have Mitosis as part of them.\n3. Choices B and E do not match what Mitosis consists of, therefore they are eliminated as options.\n4.

Choices:  Slices of watermelon, slices of lemon, a small gnat, orange peels, an orange, an apple.\nRationales:\n\n1. First of all, notice that the first three items are all sliced, but the last one is a whole piece. This should give a hint that the first three are likely to be eaten, and the last one is not:\n\n2. Also, we can see that the first three do not end in -t;\n\n3. So, \"a small gnat\" -a singular noun- does not end in -t, so we can take it out;\n\n4. Likewise, \"an orange\" is a singular noun, so we can take that out too;\n\n5. And, finally, all of the remaining items do end in -t- except the last one.\n\n6.

Choices: 1. A: make it hard 2. B: make it small 3. C: make it heavy 4. D: make it hard to move 5. E: make it big 6. F: make it hot\nRationales: Steps: 1. First understand the question. 2. Consider that we don't want to determine the answer, but rather make an assumption regarding the question, based on a specific type of answer choice. 3. We are given six answer choices. Consider if at least one of these is a common strategy we might use to show that an object or substance is solid. 4. The best way to determine the correct answer is to first list each of the 6 possible choice in the order they appear, as: A, B, C, D, E, F 5. List any common strategies you use to \"show\" that something is solid and see if you can make that strategy fit each of the six choices presented. 6.

Choices:  A) a hybrid car B)a used car C)an electric car D)a brand new car E)a fossil fuel car\nRationales: First, define the environment. 1. The environment refers to the natural world that surround us, including air, water, soil, plants, animals, and other living things, as well as the conditions under which they live.  2. Based on this definition. I could ask, which of these _two_ are you _choosing_ to have a less negative _impact on the environment_? 3. \"A hybrid car\" is a car that uses both electricity and gasoline to run. It is, however, still a car that relies on gasoline. 4. Consider this. Is it an \"environmentally-friendly\" choice to buy or drive a _car_, even an electric one? Not exactly. Cars have a negative impact on the environment because they pollute air, use resources, and harm the natural world. 5. To have a less negative impact \"on the environment\", you would need to _change_ the _type of_ vehicle you are driving. You would need to stop driving a car and opt for \"A): a hybrid car\", but one powered by green energy, or \"B): a used car\"\" 6. Note that when comparing environmental choices, it's not necessary to decide between a \"used car\" and a \"new\" one. They could both be considered \"used\", depending on their age. But even that distinction isn't necessary. The choices between electric and fossil fuel cars or between \"hybrid \" and \"electric \" cars could stand alone as they have very different impacts on the environment. 7. \"D): a brand new car\" is an option on its own. It is not an option to have \"a less negative impact on the surrounding environment\". \"Choosing\" a brand new car makes no sense whatsoever in this context.

Nose\nRationales: Brain is behind the eye socket and so isn't a target for radiation coming from an x-rays; in fact radiation might harm the brain.\nThe ear canal also isn't a good place because it might absorb some radiation; that could harm the eardrum and ear canal.\nRadiation might also harm your skin and might cause cancer if it gets through your skin to your body tissues, so don't do an x-ray of your skin, but you could x-ray some parts of your body. \nFollowing that same principle, an x-ray wouldn't be useful to detect the inside of your nose because it would be too close. Same for the teeth, the x-ray would have to go down the throat, another place where you don't want an x-ray. \nThe best place to use it is bones, which are dense enough to absorb the x-ray fairly well, and bones are where we use it because it shows anatomy and helps us diagnose disease.\nAnswer: D, Nose\n\nInput: A man used one more piece of paper on the train, which was very expensive.

Choices:  B: yes C: no D: yes  E: no F: yes G: no H: yes\nRationales: Manual is more specific than it means you only have to use your hands, and even more specific is whether you use it for the brake or clutch.\n\nInput: What is a country called when it is located inside another country? Choices:  R: state  T: city Z: island  D: district E: province\nRationales: The last part of the question suggests some options could be the same and/or not exist. Some are the same but not the same time. City and state can both include cities and states. Island and state can both include islands and states, but it is unlikely this is what the question is asking because it would be better to use the term country for both options. District and state can both include districts and states, but it would be unlikely to include districts in the country as it is more common to use this term for the country. There is a province in Germany, Ontario and Quebec, but \"province\" is not included in the other options. Therefore, the answer would be B: country.\n\nInput: The students are learning about the metric measurements in their home country. They are learning how to measure height.

Choices:  B: refrigerator C: living room D: cabinet E: car door\nRationales: Consideration for Context:\n\n* Mr. Brian, as indicated in the introduction, lives in a house.\n* He drinks a lot, and straw/soda bottles are often found near his refrigerator\n* He also has other rooms in his house, such as a living room, a cabinet, and a car door\n\nReasoning Steps: \n\n1. In order to answer the question, we need to first determine what Mr. Brian's house looks like.\n2. The options that are not related to Mr. Brian's living situation are eliminated.\n3. We can quickly eliminate options A: refrigerator and E: car door as refrigerators are not usually visible from where you would pick up a straw, and Mr. Brian likely drives and parks his car outside of the house.\n4. It's reasonable to assume that Mr. Brian's home and refrigerator aren't in a public space that would be visible from the outside. Choices B: living room and C: cabinet are eliminated as Mr. Brian's personal space is not typically used as a public entrance spot for visitors, nor would it be reasonably expected that straw would be kept in a private space like a cabinet. \n5. In the remaining choices, keep D: office door in mind as a possibility given the limited context provided. Although the question itself doesn't specify Mr. Brian's location, since he lives in a house, it's reasonable to assume he also has an office or desk in his home.\n6.

Choices: A: find a new way to drive B: find what they want to buy at a store C: lose their way D: find what they forgot to buy E: find a new way home\nRationales: First, it's important to analyze what the phrase \"find their way\" means and how it relates to a map.\nThe phrase \"find their way to somewhere\" means to find your way to a specific location by locating and following a map or directions.\nThis is similar to what a map helps travelers do. It helps by providing the visual map so they can figure out how to get where they need to go.\nFrom the question, you know that the phrase is used as a way to describe what a map helps people do. It's also crucial to realize that maps can help a variety of people.\nThey can be used by drivers, walkers, bikers, and travelers of all kinds. There are maps for every type and size of journey.\nIn order to find what the correct answer is, you'll have to determine which answer choice is the most specific.\nThe answer choices can all be applied to maps as a tool for finding direction.\nThe answer is E: find what they forgot. \nAnswer: E: find what they forget\n\n### Explanation:\nThe option E: find what they got forgot/forget\n\n### Source:\nWritten by [Marcus](https://github.com/themarcus)", "answer": " 32"}

Choices:  (A) light (B) darkness (C) movement (D) noise (E) color\nRationales: First, understand the question: It asks about a visual representation, or what you would see in a reflection in a mirror.\n2. Consider the answer choices that are not related to visuals: noise, movement, and color.\n3. Among the remaining options, recognize that a reflection doesn't emit light or change color.\n4. Consider the following:\n\n5. A reflection is the same image seen in a mirror, like what you would see if someone were standing behind you and looking at your reflection in the mirror.\n6. Since light is necessary for an image to be created by a mirror, a reflection would not be visible if there's no light.\n7. Recognize that without light, darkness or shadow would still be seen.\n8. Similarly, there is no sound without vibrational energy, so any movement (such as the movement of someone appearing in a reflection) could not necessarily be a sound.\n9. Therefore, of the answer choices related to visuals, the only one that could potentially be seen in a reflected image is D: Movement.\n10. The right answer is D: Movement, which means a reflective item would show any movement, such as someone behind you looking in a mirror.\n11. This means choice B: Darkness could be eliminated, as darkness is the absence of light and would be seen with or without movement.\n12. You could also eliminate choice E: Color because the reflective item would not change color.\n13. The final answer is D: Movements.\n\nInput: Where does an onion cutter go?

Choices: 1) They have large numbers of legs and wings, 2) They have many body segments and one pair of antennae, 3) They have hard exoskeletons, and 4) They are cold-blooded\nRationales: Insects have many identifiable traits in common.\n1. All four options could be considered as being related to insects, given the context of the question.\n2. However, the question seeks a \"common trait of insects,\" so we should focus on identifying the most significant element that would be present in all insects.\n3. Exoskeletons (option 3) are an individual characteristic that is not present in all insects, as some insects are not covered in a hard shell, such as cicadas (option 4).\n4. The trait that should be selected as the one common to all insects is the presence of wings (option 1).\n5. All insects have at least two pairs of wings and this trait is not found in other organisms.\n6. Therefore the correct answer is 3: They have hard exoskeltons\nAnswer: B: Having hard exoskeletal\n\nInput: where would you find a shelf?

Choices:  a: broken b: fused c: shattered d: cracked e: split f: destroyed g: smashed h: cracked\nRationales: Consider \"shattered\" and \"smashed\" \n1. These two words mean the same thing: having broken, splintered, or shattered into pieces. \n2. They both end in \"-ed\", but \"smashed\" is an active verb, while \"shattered\" is a past participle.\n3. \"Broken\" is a past participe of the verb \"break,\" which is to \"separate into parts.\n4. So, you know, \"smashed\" refers to the verb \"smash\" which means \"to break into pieces.\"\n5. It's clear that \"shattered = broken.\" The important part of the sentence is \"were my glasses\"\n6. You have to think what is washed when it is broken\n7. To break, it has to be done by force or suddenly. \n8. Hence \"shattered\" or \"broken\" is the right option \n9. \"Were my glasses smashed?\" means, whether the glasses were broken or not\n10. \"Were my glasesses smashed?\" does not make sense.

Dentists encourage patients to floss for hygienic reasons, it ensures teeth are clean, preventing cavities or other complications that could lead to more expense on dental care. A: It ensured that your teeth stay clean\n2. B: This choice could be a problem.  Food that is decomposing quickly can actually lead to plaque build-up and tooth decay.\n3. C: Flossing your teeth does in fact, clean them, but this isn't the primary reason that dentists recommend doing so.\n4. D: Cavities are a result of plaque build-up, but flossing alone cannot eliminate cavities. You'd eventually need to visit the dentist.\n5.

Choices:  Choices:  A.: use a mouth device B.: get a puffer C.: get a nose ring D.: take medicine E: get surgery\nRationales: We can start out by eliminating options \nthat have nothing to do with the nose. \n2. Options D: take medicine and E: get surgery.\n\n3. Option D: take medicine would probably not result in a better nasal passage and the question does not specify a nose-related situation either.\n\n4. Option E: get surgery is related to a nose-related situation but would require you to visit a doctor with or without access to a nose-related issue.\n\n5. This may be reasonable for an unexpected issue, however, a solution that could apply to a non-nose issue would also serve.\n\n6. Option A: use a mouth device is one of a mouth-related solution but is not required if you do not have access to a nose device. \n\n7. However, if you have access, then choosing option A would allow you to breathe through your mouth more comfortably.\n\n8. Option B: get a puffer is one way to breathe for those with asthma or asthma-related issues but this is not specific to the nose and would not be the right choice by itself.\n\n9. We assume that only a nose-related problem is required. \n\n10. The only remaining option is option C: get a", "answer": " 84"}

Choices:  a. because she is an English monarch b.because she has a crown on her head c. she is the monarch of England d. she is the ruler of all of England e. she is the only woman in her society\nRationales: The rationale: 1. The answer clearly implies that all the options are not needed to answer the statement. i.e. The question and answer choices, when simplified, are : \"Why would someone be referred to her as the Queen of all England\" and \"she is the monarch of England\". i.e. It is not asking why \"the Queen is the only woman of her society\" and \"Why is the Queen of all England\". 2. The question is referring to the situation of the Queen who is the monarch of England, and therefore the referal of the \"Queen of all England\" must be because the Queen is the monarch of England. However, we cannot infer from \"she is the monarch\" to \"she is the monarch all England\". Hence, the answer to the question is D. \"she is the Monarch of England\".\nAnswer: D. \"she is Monarch of England.\"\n\nInput: Where are children\u2019s scooters made?\nChoices:  A. China B. U.S. C.

Choices:  - No tools  - Measures of Length and Width  - Calculator  - Compass/ruler  - Geometric Ruler\nRationales:\n\n1. What would a teacher want for finding the perimeter? The teacher wants a tool that will make the math as easy, accurate, and efficient as possible.\n2. Considering the choices:\n  + Measures of Length & Width - they can help with the calculation of the height but nothing to do with the length (perimeter = 4 sides). \n  + Calculator - they help the instructor get an estimate of the length in the first place but does nothing for perimeter. Considering the type of question where you just need to calculate perimeter there might be much simpler approaches available.\n  + Compass/ruler - using the ruler is an option however it is more complicated (calculating height on your own). Considering what is given to the students and the task they need to complete this will be a more complicated approach that might not be easy to understand.\n  + Geometric Ruler - the geometric ruler is a new tool available for those who want to use it for perimeter-related tasks.\n3. Consider the choices.\n  + Option - No Tools - While this is a good option if you don't want to do any calculations but it will not help with accuracy which is the goal. \n  + Geometric ruler - the ruler will make for a good tool as it allows for an easy, efficient, and accurate calculation of the length of any side. \n  + Option - Calculator - If you don't want any calculation and don't mind the time it takes to use the ruler then you might want to go for this option.\n4.

What was invented much before the wheel? Choices: A: writing, speaking. B: bicycle, automobile. C: television, radio. D: radio, bicycle. E: wheel, television.\nRationales: Given that the answer involves \"much before\" or \"much later\", we can eliminate (E, wheel, television). (E, television) was a common answer to similar earlier questions, because the television was invented in 1927 and the wheel was invented in before 3500 BC. Since this is a 21st century question, the other half has to be within a few years on either side.\n\nNext, we can eliminate (D, radio bicycle). This answer requires that either of those two items be invented before the wheel, or within a few years. As (D) is the year of the radio's invention, we can cross radio off and eliminate (C, television radio). The same year of the first radio invention has occurred (B) for two other potential choices, the automobile and the bicycle.

The student hasn't mentioned which context they're working in; is it an electronic or human brain? Is it both?\n2. If we are referring to an electronic brain that has no human connection, one would think that it should make sense that the reason the brain would stop working would be that its \"battery has run out\".\n3. However, in the given context, this answer would not make sense. This is because the question asks why you might think a person's brain stops working. \n4. So, in the correct context, we're referring to the brain of a person, not an electronic brain that has a battery.\n5. As the context is for a person's brain and their function, therefore, all the other choices are irrelevant. Excepting choice A: they've had too many to drink - which is a poor connection to the context.\n6. This poor connection makes answer A and choice B: too much exercise seem unlikely.\n7. Choice D: too many poor decisions can be relevant as a brain can stop working from being overloaded, and poor decisions could be considered a reason for this. \n8.

Choices: (A) surgery (B) nursery (C) emergency room (D) reception (E) labor and delivery\nRationales: The question asks where a nurse does not work in a hospital. Therefore, we should look for places nurses do not often work.\na) Nurses do not usually work in the surgery. This makes choice (A) incorrect.\nb) Nurses may be assigned tasks in many other places in the hospital other than the nursery. This makes choice (B) incorrect.\nc) The emergency room is one of the most common places nurses work and the emergency room is where patients go to when they need help urgently or for non-life-threatening injuries.

This is why the correct answer is B: landfill. \nAnswer: B: landfill \nInput: What is a synonym for the word \"lunch?\" Choices:  A. appetizer B. entree C. dinner D. snack E. dessert\nRationales: First, recognize that the word \"lunch\" is being used in its common sense as a meal that is eaten during the mid-day (from midday to midday).  Therefore, it is a synonym for its common definition.\n2. The word \"lunch\" can also be used to specifically refer to the time or period at which a meal is eaten (from midday until early afternoon).\n3. In this case the word \"lunch' is not being used to refer to a mid-day meal but to a mid-day period, and in this case the synonym for 'lunch' is \"noon\" or \"midday.\"\n4. The only acceptable answer is therefore C, \"dinner.\" \nAnswer Choice: C. dinner. \n\nInput: What\u2019s the opposite of the word \u201cvomit?\u201d Choices:  A, \u201ccram\u201d B, \u201cthrow up\u201d C, \u201ceat\u201d D, \u201cspew\u201d E, \u201cregurgitate\u201d\nRationales: The word \"vomit\" is being used in the common sense of the word which has negative connotations. \n2. The opposite of that in common usage would be the word \"eat\" which may be used more prominently or frequently in the question with a different usage of \"eat\" which is not being used negatively.\n3. The only correct and acceptable answer is therefore E: \"Regurgitate.\"  \nAnswer: E: \"Regurgitation\"\n\nInput: What is another word for the word \"vacation?\" Choice: A. travel B.", "answer": " 2000"}

D: 2.5 \u00d7 5 = 12.5 kg is wrong.\n\nNext step is to compare the units given in the question. The given metric system units are kg, m, cm, in. And the one that differs is m; so we search for the corresponding units of length using the converter tool linked at the bottom. This shows that: 1.7 m is 1.7 \u00d7 0.01 = 0.017 km.\n\nThe answer given in the book is incorrect as the conversion from m to km was not applied (as shown by the original units). Thus the correct answer is B 1.35 g.\n\nAnswer: B 1.333", "answer": " 35"}

Choices: A: local farms B: chain stores C: specialty shops D: gas stations\nRationales: The best coffee will almost always come from local farms. The reason is that coffee beans grown by major global companies do not have as much taste and flavor compared to those beans grown in local farms. The fact that it takes many months before coffee beans are ready to harvest gives producers ample of time to care for the plants.

Choices:  O: run A: scream B: take medication C: go to the hospital D: use your phone E: cry\nRationales: The question asked about things that you should do when you have an emergency. The response must be something that can be done:\n1. An emergency is a situation that requires immediate attention and action, so the response cannot be something that can't be done in that situation, like using your phone or crying. \n2. You can't run or scream in an emergency, as they require action and concentration, so these aren't possible responses.\n3. Medication, while helpful for some, will not solve the immediate problem and is not a response to an emergency. \n4. The hospital is a possible response, but not every emergency requires going to a hospital, like minor cuts or sprains. So the answer cannot be 'go to the hospital.' \n5. If you have an emergency, you might use your phone to call for help or find instructions on how to deal with the emergency, but it can't be used in place of actually taking action or making a phone call.\n6.

Choices:  A. softer B. heavier C. easier to squeeze by hand D. no reason E. firmer\nRationales: First understand what the question is seeking to clarify. It is wanting to help you identify an objective fact about tires (that is, why they are hard, not why are tires made of rubber, for example). \n1. Note that the question does not seek to identify or clarify which of the answer choices is most appropriate to some task or task setting (e.g. what color you are most likely to select when buying tires for a car). Instead, which answer choice is the correct objective fact about the hardness of tires. \n2. Choices A and C are not incorrect and not objective facts about tires. Their inclusion as correct answer choices is an example of leading the witness.\n3. Choices B and D are incorrect, as they are not objective facts about tire hardness but simply speculative opinions or subjective evaluations that fail to accurately identify an objective fact.\n4.

Choices:  a) the end b) Mars c) the Moon d) Sun e) planets\nRationales: The correct answer must be B. First, we need to know what the Earth is.

We are not told about all the planets that make up Earth, so we cannot determine this.\nIf one of the planets mentioned is Mars, this would have suggested Earth 3. So one of the planets must be the end of Earth 1, which must be the Earth which has no planets. This reduces the choices to 3.\n\nWe are looking for a star to be the end of Earth. So the correct answer must contain an item of the list of planets and stars. For the planets, there are 4 choices left. This reduces the answer to 4.\nWe know that the sun cannot be the end of Earth because it has no planets. Also, if the end is Earth 2, it must be a planet, because if the end is Earth, it cannot be a star.

This indicates that you shouldn't consider \"yes if\" or \"no if\" type answer choices.\n1. In the context of the question, you should only consider \"yes if\", \"no if\" type choices (in other words, just \"If x, then y\" type)\n  a. For instance, \"If not legal to smoke cigaretes in malls, then it is not illegal to smoke cigarettse on the beaches.\"\n1. The answer choices should have to do with smoking in public, and this is only considered illegal in private, not public, areas. \n2. As a result, your answer choices should either be \"yes if or no if\". \n  b. For example, you could decide that you don't want to consider \"yes if\" type choices, so \"If y, then x\".\n2.

The question is an analogous task in a story problem format where we are asked to consider the appropriate place to attach an erasing instrument to address a mistake in writing.\n2. The erasing instrument is a pen or pencil, which usually refers to an actual tool in English-speaking contexts. However, the word can also be used as a colloquial reference for a written erasure when writing digitally.\n3. This provides the contextual cue necessary to determine the best answer.\n4. Although A: cupboard can be used for storage, the choice B: table includes a table with a horizontal surface that can be used for writing. Thus, we can cross out choice A.\n5. This leaves us with three remaining choices: D: keyboard, C: pencil, and J. pen.\n6. A keyboard is a device you use for typing (not writing). Thus, choice D is incorrect.\n7. Similarly, pencil, while the erasers are typically used for pencil erasers, they can also be used for erasing on paper. This is not a unique feature associated with C: pencil.\n8.

If you're not looking for the fruit the fruit itself might just be an excuse for you to eat it. \"apple\" is \"A\" and is therefore invalid. \"orange\" is fruit and starts by an \"O\" so \"orange\" is valid.\n\n5. Therefore, the answer to the instructions is \"A: orange\" as \"orange\" is the only fruit starting with an \"O\" not followed by \"plum\".\n\n6. Answer: A: The answer to the question is \"apple\".\n\n## See also\n\n* Rules of inference (logic)\n* Prolog Indentation Scheme\n* Y-combinator", "answer": " 16"}

Choices:  A-they die B-they live C-neither will die D-there is no evidence on this matter E-people don't know when they can die.\nRationales: For A to be the correct answer, the term \"matter\" must relate to the same subject as the rest of the sentence. \nIn this case, the term \"matic\" refers to the subject of \"whether the old ladies live or dye.\" \nSince the term \"matter of\" means \"a matter or event considered from another point of view,\" it would apply to the previous context given, which is \"whether the old lady lives or dies.\"\nIt doesn't refer to \"the old lady lives or dies\" as a general subject, but instead to the matter of the old ladies lives or death.\nThe old ladies are more than a matter concerning their lives;\nIt is a matter regarding whether they are dead or alive.\nRationales(2): This problem can be simplified to determine a matter relates to the subject of the problem, the term \"mater of\" could be a synonym to synonyms \"thing\".\nExample: The car is a thing that moves. => The car is a matter related to the subject \"thing\".\nThings refers to an object, and the term thing must also apply to an object.\nSince it is a term that does not refer to an object (eg. the dog is the thing that moved.=> The dog does not move), it is not a synonym for thing.\nTherefore conclusion would be: A is the correct answer to this problem.\n\nInput: Which option is the correct choice?

Choices:  C: food D: attention E: love F: friendship\nRationales: The question is asking what petting the cat could mean to her owner.\n7. First, understand that the cat will petting her, rather than \"it\" because the cat is female, and her owner will be petting her, not pet \"the cat\".\n8. The question doesn't say that the cat is petting her owner, which would make her the pet of her owner rather than someone who is being pet.\n9. Recognize that \"petting\" is a synonym for \"cuddling\" or \"roughhousing with affection\", indicating a non-violent or non-aggressive kind of play between two animals or humans being intimate with each other, as a relationship.\n\n10. Find the option that describes the feeling of intimacy between a human and an animal, and confirm your answer by examining the word choice \"represent\" in the question.\n\n11.

Use coupon A: buy milk, use coupon B: use coupon, don't buy milk 2. Buy milk, Use coupon 3. Buy milk, use coupon, give away milk 4. Don't buy milk, don't use coupon, get milk for free\nRationales: First, read through all the choices and determine if they make sense. Does the question make sense?\n1. 1. Use the coupon at the store, buy milk: This would work as long as there was one coupon for every product, and the cost of the milk were less than the limit. There is one coupon if you buy two things, so this could work under the assumption that milk was cheaper than two other items.\n2. 2. Buy the milk and use the coupon at the register: If you buy enough milk (say, two $1.45 bottles) for this to be worth your while, then this makes sense. However, if the coupon is only good for one bottle of milk, this will get you only one use.\n3. 3. Buy the milk, use the coupon, give away the milk: Only if you buy your milk in bulk will this make sense, given that you have more coups than bottles of milk to distribute.\n4. 4. Don' t buy milk and don't use the coupon: This makes sense if you don't use coupons but the price is still under $2.85.\n1. For this question, you need to come to a certain conclusion.\n2.

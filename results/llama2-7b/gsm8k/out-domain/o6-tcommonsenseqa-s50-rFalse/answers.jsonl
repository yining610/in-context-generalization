So my friend called and he does not work so he just got paid $350. He is going to call back and get some money from his mom.\nOutput: B: my friend works part time at a restaurant and he is going to call back to ask for money from his mom. He pays $350 so he does not need that much money for living and working and because he is sick and he can't get any money to buy food, he is going to call his mom to see if she will send him some money to make up the rest of the difference between what he is making now and what it actually costs to live.

The pinnae have small, brown, leaflet branchlets, each having a long stem at its base, called a rachis: the structure of the fern leaf is very complex. The fern leaf feeder has all the parts of a flower. It grows from a small reddish-brown spore. It produces an oval sporophyll whose outer surface is covered with a brown covering called a epidermis. Inside is the reproductive tissue. The sporophyll is called a staminate, containing male reproductive structures called antheridia. It also contains female reproductive structures called archegonia.

To me, I was able to test the patience. If I knew how to do my assignment, I would have done the same way.  I believe that the project was very useful to me. Before making this application, it was very difficult to write and test applications.  We learned how to test functions. It helps me to understand the importance of testing at the time of coding. After this workshop I was able to understand testing the code. If I had to do this project again I would do things better. I had to do the work with more care and attention.\n```\n\n### My future:\n``` \nI will continue programming in C# language. I plan to continue to study this course next semester.

We have three outcomes:\n\n1. Counter 12\n2. 3 is not in counter\n3. 3 is in counter\n\nWith that said, the first counter is 12 and we have an outcome of 12, but we know that 12 is 1 + 2 so our second counter is two and we have outcome three. It's a probability of 1/6 and the other outcomes have a probability of 1.\n\nNext we calculate the probability of the answer for the last question number but not the last question number plus five. We find that the probability is 1/6 by the same logic.\n\n#### Part 2\n\n\n`grade_quiz(i)` returns a tuple in the form `(grade, answer)`\n\n#### Part 3\n\nThe teacher gave Randy $3,00 + (10% of $3,00), where 10% is the answer chosen by the teacher.\n\nHere is an example if the teacher gave him a question with an answer of", "answer": " 2000"}

When they are discovered the paleontologist may not know what animal the bones belong to. He has a special method for categorizing large collections of bones and other material evidence.  If he is given a jar of bones to identify, he has to determine whether they belong to a group of four-legged dinosaurs.\nThe dinosaurs he is searching for have digits that are in the following order:1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. A two-digit number also called a pair will always have one of the digits repeated. A one-digit number means that the digits are not repeated. For example, 13 has one digit repeated (13 = 31), but 45 has two digits that are not repeated (45 = 54). This method is used to help identify these dinosaurs\nThe first two numbers in the dinosaur's digits will help identify the species.  The number will look like the following: [", "answer": " 1"}

{"text": "There were 10 jelly beans remaining in the bag after the first round of drawing. The 80% children had a 20% chance that they would get a jelly bean. Hence, they pulled out 2 beans after each child drew. So at the end of children drawing each child got either 2 jelly beans, 1 jelly bean or no beans at all. But only 20% of children got 1 jelly bean and the rest 80% got 2 jelly beams. So, 20% * 1 = 0.2 * 2 = 0.4 = 40%, 80% * 2 = 80% * (0.2 * 1 + 0.8 * 2) = 0.8 * (0.2 + 0.4) = 0.16 = 16%; So if number beans remaining after first round is 80% of total jelly beans left then 10 jelly bean should be total jelly beans. So the children got 6 jelly beans each (2 * 3 = 6)\n### Note:The above code has been modified from solution given by Nishikant Trivedi.", "answer": " 36"}

One way to start a new math classroom tradition is to have students vote on a name for their classroom. This might be for naming their classroom, the bulletin board, the table, or even the room itself.   Students might brainstorm the name ideas before voting or work together to come up with a catchy name.  They may also use the school mascot (or in this case, the classroom number) as their classroom title. For example, the class could be called the \u201cOwls of Room 22\u201d as a play on \u201cOwls of 201\u201d for room number 201.

What about a class? Now, let\u2019s use these smaller questions to help us figure out a bigger one so that we can start talking about what we need to accomplish, what goals we hope to reach, and what we think others might try to do. Suppose we know that people and dogs are both made up of cells. We can use the same question we used to think about what we can do with cells in dogs (e.g., make them sick) and apply it to people and see what it can tell us about what people can do that can make life difficult or painful. What is one example of a purpose for a fruit or vegetable?

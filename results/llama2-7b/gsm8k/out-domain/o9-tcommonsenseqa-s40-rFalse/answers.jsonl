The user inserted the card and typed in the Personal Identification Number, which identified the account that the customer wished to withdraw money from.\nThe ATM printed the cash required for the customer to withdraw.\nThe maximum withdrawal amount per transaction is \u00a3100.\nCustomers may take the maximum withdrawal amount from their personal accounts or their joint account which can contain two or\nmore personal accounts. If only one person is drawing from a joint account the remaining people can receive a refund by asking the bank.\nWhen withdrawing money at an ATM the customer's own bank charges a \u00a31 fee plus\n1% of the withdrawal amount.\nThe first time a person used an ATM there was a 50p fee on the transaction and some banks also charged a percentage instead of a flat rate.\nCustomers can obtain a refund from their own bank for the fee but only if the withdrawal amount included the maximum allowed transaction amount of 100 pounds.\nMany banks still charge a fee when a customer withdraws money with a card that belongs to a non-customers account.\nWhen a customer adds money to their account at an ATM they may also pay a 50p withdrawal fee.\nIn 2008, an estimated \u00a37 billion was spent by bank customers with a 1% debit fee on 7.6 billion transactions. The debit fee has been standard since 2006.\nThere are currently 215 ATMs per 100,000 adults in the UK. The number has decreased in the last 1", "answer": " 864"}

How long did it take for the royalty to eat this recipe? \nOutput: 30 seconds\n\nInput: Please remember the length of the hamburger is 20 cm per side. A hot dog buns width is 2 cm, meaning 6 cm per side for a single bun for just three buns. Therefore, the total width per hamburger would be 18 cm. You may subtract each bun's four sides, because we are asking for the space inside them. There is no reason to add, since this amount is so small that it is zero by negligible. If a unit is not given, assume cm. Since this works for centimeters and has one of the options being a single bun, it should work for inches as well.

Here's an example: 9 - 8 = 1; 12 - 10 = 2.  Now, given the first step, we can take whatever step we want with the second step: in this instance, we would take the second step twice to arrive at 9 - 8 - 8 - 7 = -7.\nOutput:subtract the smaller\n\nInput:In the example problem, for instance, it may help to notice that 2.5 - 1.5 = 1, and 3.0 - 1.85 = 1.15.  Therefore the second step becomes 1.5 - 1 -.85 -.15 = -3.\nOutput:substract twice \n\nInput:For example, suppose we want to subtract 16 from 132: 16 - 16 = 0, and 132 - 12 = 120.  Therefore the second subtraction step becomes: 0 - 12 = -12.\nOutput:substrack -9\n\nInput:For each of these numbers, determine the value of y by calculating the following: For 72 - 68, the answer is -4. For 215 - 35, the answer is -160.(72 - 65 = -3, 215 -16 = 199)\nOutput:subtrac -3 for each\n\nInput:First, let's look at a sample problem.  In the example problem, we can immediately see that 68 - 43 = 25 and 219 - 86 = 133.  There is no further subtraction we might need to apply.  In the problem, however, we see that 858 - 857 = -1.

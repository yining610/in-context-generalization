{"text": "1) Given that Natalia sold clips to fourty eight friends in April and sold half as many clipros in May, the overall number of clips are forty eight plus the half in May and minus the clips she sold in April.\n2) The second option for answering the question is given that she sold clips to forty-eight friends in April and then sold forty-eight clips in May, the overall sum would be equal to the number of friends she sold to plus the amount of friends that she sold to. This would be the number of people she sold to as given in the options 3 and 4.\n3) Since she sold them she must have bought them and thus the overall amount of these 'friends' (as they are not called by the name) would be forty-eight plus forty-eight or forty eight friends in total. Thus we can say that the options 3 and four are the same answer but have a different number of friends sold.\n4) Finally, the overall amount of clips that Natalia sold would be equal to forty-eight plus the number of friends she bought. If we multiply this overall number by the number of friends she purchased, we get the answer (as there are two sets of friends here).", "answer": " 72"}

Choices: 1. Be careful and cautious. 2. Increase their appetite. 3. Be indefatigable. 4. Stop excreting altogether. 5. Decrease their appetite  Output: A. Catfish produce eggs and then excrete a protein called snottle that digests catfish eggs.  This process enables them to regurgitate the contents of their stomachs.  Such an unusual and unexpected method of reproduction raises an interesting question: How do the catfish remain well fed and fat if they have to stop eating altogether?\n\nOutput: \n1.

{"text": "176\n2.The key to solving this problem is to first compute how much James earns at his main job and then compute how much he earns at his second job.\n3.He earns $20 per hour at his main job which means he earns $20*30 = $600 per week at his main job.\n4.He earns 20\\% less at his second job which means he earn $600*(0.2) = $120 per week at his second job. The whole salary from the second job also gets deducted from the earnings at James' main job, which results in James only earning $600*(1-.2) = $460 on the weekly basis while working at his main Job.\n5.Combining these earnings gives us his overall annual income as $112*52 = $5837.29 per year.\n6.Since he works only 30 hrs at his main Job and 15 hrs at his second job, this results in total annual hours worked as $5837*30/214hrs = 176 hrs per year. This translates to $176/7*24hrs = $176/24*30hrs = $900 per week.\n7.As a result, he makes $5837/900 or the value $6495 as monthly salary.\n8.This then results in a weekly income of $6495*7 or $45,000 per year.\n9.Hence, the answer to the question is $45,029.92.", "answer": " 840"}

{"text": "$44.57\nExplanation:\n1. By definition: A discount is the amount of money that is deducted from a product's price as a one-time cut.\n2. From our given information: A one-year subscription to the paper costs $80.\n3. The above information indicates that the paper itself normally costs $80. But this time, it's offered at $44.557.\n4. This means that we are discounted by 45%.\n5. The logic should be to take the original price, discount that by 15% of original price. So lets do that by using math.\n6. Thus, we have: (100 - 40) = 60 for a price reduction of 40%.\n7. Substitute 40% with 45% in the original math.\n8. So: (80 - (40 X 45)) = 44.567 as the discounted price.\n9. And thus, the answer is $44.566. But $44.547 is too close to $44.536, so we can discount it to $44.675.\n10. So the correct answer is $44,566.\n\nInput: There are $925 \\% 100$ cases of people who like to drink water.

We are supposed to establish the quantity of rectangular tiles and cylindrical tiling used to make the Mosaic.\n2. From the question statement we have that there are two kinds of tiling: Rectangular and cylindrical, that are sold separately at the same price and the rectangular ones cost 65$ each while the cylindrical one costs 100$.\n3. From the question we know that each tile is 60% more costly than the other thus the cost of each tile will be 15 more than the other, which is also the cost of a single tiling.\n4. We also know that the mosaic requires 120 tiling in total and there are 2 of each different tiling.\n5. We find the number of rectangle tiles to be 12 and cylindrical ting to be 8.\n6.

At the end of the play, we learn that all three are dead.  By the nature of comedy, we have to assume their demises are humiliating, though they are not at the end. Why don\u2019t their deaths matter? Choices: 1. Death doesn\u2019t matter because it\u2019s not in the end. 2. Death doesn\u2019t really matter because the actors are dressed. 3. The deaths of Mrs. Page and the cuckold are irrelevant because Shakespeare makes it very clear they\u2019ve never had any lines. 4. Death doesn\u2019t mean anything because it\u2019s in the end. 5. The death of Dogberry is irrelevant because his death has no bearing on the final outcome of the play.\nOutput: A: Because it has no bearing on the outcome of the play, it\u2019s acceptable if the actor portraying Dogberry (Dogbolt, in this case) dies tragically.\n\nInput: Question: A: Because it's in the end, which would make the death meaningful.  And, B: Because the actor is dressed, which means they had to be present at the time of their deaths (wearing costumes), and, C: Their deaths are irrelevant because Shakespeare makes them very clear they\u2019ve had no lines.

{"text": "1) The problem states that Jake has 5000 dollars and he goes on to spend 2800 on bike, which leaves a balance of 2220 dollars.\n2) Next, Jake decides to buy a ticket for a concert. At the same time, he loses a fourth of the remaining balance, which leaves him with 1200 in the end.\n3) Now we need to find out how much money he spent on the bike and how much money he initially had and the amount of money he lost. We need this information to solve the problem.\n4) So from this information, its possible to calculate how much a ticket cost. We know that the total money he spent on the ticket is half of the remaining 1200 dollars and thus, it costs 600 dollars.\n5) Lastly, we combine this information with the money he lost. So the way to approach the problem is, to find out how much he spent on the bikey and how much money was left at the end of his spending.\n6) So, let's use this information to arrive at an answer. We know that the motorcycle cost $2800 and the total money he has 500. So, $2800 > $500. This means that he bought a high end motorcycle, which costs $3300 dollars.\n7) Since he spent all of his money, the bike has to be his primary expense. His remaining money was 1200.\n8) We can easily find out his loss as a percent. Lets do the calculation. Since his loss is 1200/500 which is 24%.\n9) So the total money he spent is $2800 + 1200 = $4000.\n10) The last part of the question is asking how much money he has left. In order to calculate this, we know he loses 24% of his money. Let's plug in the numbers and try the calculation. So 1200 is the total money lost from his total money that he had at the beginning which means he lost 1/4 of the money. So 12/4\n11) This equals $300.\n\nOutput: 12/4", "answer": " 825"}

The problem also revolves around the lack of money he had and the children not receiving any.\n2: The 'dollar' refers to the first child, the 'ten dollars' refers to the second child and the 'ten dollars' again refers to the third child.\n3: The sentences highlights the fact that his children are entitled to a 'ten dollars' amount each but the father's financial instability resulted in his incapacity to provide this, hence leaving an insufficient legacy.\n4: Finally, as the children are not mentioned by their name, It is evident that the children mentioned in the question can be described as the stepson.\n5: The final line suggests the fathers intentions of leaving behind money for the children which can be provided as part of his legacy. Also, it emphasizes that despite the generous and good intentions of the father leaving behind money for his children, he couldn't fulfill it due to financial distress.  This, however, does not imply that he did not leave money for the children, instead he provided a smaller amount which does not fulfill the actual demands but rather leaves a token sum to the children.\n6: We can fill the blank in the sentence with 'ten' dollars as it fits best in the sentence from the given choices.\nSo the final Ans is 'ten dollars'.", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "50\nAnswer: 1. The context of the sentence states that Naomi is getting ready to wash all the linens lying in the bedroom.\n2. The linen can be categorized into three different types: '1. Clothes that need to be wash on the gentle cycle, 2. Towels, 3. Sheets'.\n3.'Making piles of different types', indicates that Naomi has already grouped these linens according to the categories specified above. \n4. Hence, we can proceed to the next step: 'Washing each type into its own distinct pile'\n5. According to the clues provided in the question, the time taken to wash each type of the linens are given:\n6. 'To wash clothes on the gentle cycle takes 30 minutes'\n7. 'To wash towels requires twice the time taken to washing clothes on the gentle cycle (i.e, to wash towels takes 60 minutes)'\n8. 'To wash sheets require less time than washing towels (i.e, 15 minutes less than the time it takes to wash towls)'\n9. After accounting for the time taken by Naomi to wash each type according to the clues, we have 'to wash clothes on the wash cycle takes 30 min', 'to wash towels take 60 min', 'to clean sheets take 45 min'.\n10. The given sentence does not provide the total time Naomi took to wash the linens in it's entirety. Instead it states that, the total time Naomi has taken to make piles of the three types will take 50 min.\n11. In a real-world scenario, Naomi does not make piles of towels, sheets and clothes of different types and instead washes them together.\n12. If the total time needed to wash clothes on the 'gentle cycle' is 30 min, the total time taken to clean sheets would be 45 min, and the total time needed to clean linen clothes would be 60 min.\n13.

This means for every customer bought two book, i.e she sells two book, and for making the profit of $120, each of these books had to be sold twice at a cost of $5.

Now in order to determine total point count, we can take the shot values in ascending order. We are not allowed to consider Layups, free throws and extra shots.\n7. Thus Reggie would have played 5 long shots and lost 2 points on each of them. This would leave him with a total of 6 points.

{"text": "The first thing to notice is that Michael has matchsticks at home. How do we know? He tells us that he has them. So since he's decided to use 'a lot' of them, we have to assume he actually has enough for what he wants to do. Otherwise, why would he have matchsticks in the first place?\nNext, we learn that Michael is going to 'use' his matchsticks, which again means they have to be there. This is another way of interpreting the same information. Michael could have taken them to school, or left them at home. The implication is that they are still there, since he's making houses out of them. Therefore, Michael has a lot of match sticks at home.\nLastly, he decides to only use HALF of them and he's going to create 30 miniature match sticks houses. The implication is if he uses the whole lot, there will be 150 miniature houses. So the important thing we notice is they are all the same. They are all 30, which means he has to use 30 matchstick houses if he is going to use these 150 he already has (because he's decided to 'only' use half).\nNext, we learn he has only used HALF of his matchsticks, so that leaves 50 unused. Since there are 30 houses in total - he's used HALF of those. So Michael only did HALF of the job which implies the other half remain unused. What does that make it? 30! And Michael can create 30 of them (or houses) or houses because he has at least 30 matchstics left. (Remember: he only used HALF, and there are only 30 of them in total).\nNow to check this, we subtract 30 from 50 and that makes 20. That means he only used 20. Now, in order to do this, they must have been used to create 30 matchsticked models. To prove it, just substitute the values 30 with the number of houses he will create, which means he has 20 left unused.\nHence the final solution is this:\n30 matchsticks (the original amount Michael had) - 20 used to make", "answer": " 600"}

{"text": "1. Max was doing homework in 'three different subjects'.\n2. We need to find the total time taken by him to complete all three subjects.\n3. Let's say, he spent time (x) on doing biology assignments, time (2x) on history and time (3x) on geography assignments.\n4. Since he did biology and history assignments two times more than geography assignments, we get: (2x+x)/3 > x/3\n5. Substituting values we get: 21/3 > 12, which is true when x > 2 which means any given number of x > 2.\n6. Now, let's find the total time he spent for all three subjects by summing up individual times. (x + 2x + 3x) > 2x + 2x\n7. The value of equation (x + 2 x + 3 x) > 2 x + 2 x can be simplified to a value, using the addition formula - (x + y) + (x + y) > 2(x + y).\n7. Now, we finally end with the solution: x + x + x > 2 x which can be rewritten to x + x > 3x or x + 3/ 2x < 1.\n8. So, if x > 3/ 2 > 2 > 1, x should be \u2265 2 or > 2.\n9. Since these two options are both true statements, we can conclude that Max spent at least 2 hours on doing homework.\n10.

We have to find out how much money, Harris spends on carrots in a year.\n\n7. There are 2 ways to approach this question:\n-  The approach 1 is to firstly, find out how many large organic carrots there are in the entire year. (There are 1 carrot in every day for 1 year)\n-  The other approach is, to find out how much Harris spends every day on Carrots (5 carrots every 1 pound bag so if he has to feed his dog 1 carrot in the evening, he needs to buy 5 bags every time which means he spends $10 on carrots every day)\n8. Now there are 2 ways to calculate it\n\n-  The first way is using the Approach 1:\n-  If we take the first approach and consider 1 pound bag means there is 5 carrots then there are a total of 15 of these Carrot bags in a year (1 x 365 = 365) and \n-  The 15 bags means there will be a total of 75 carrots (1 pound bag = 5 carrots)\n-  And hence Harris will spend 750$ as he will be feeding his dog 75 organic carrot over a period of 1 year.\n9. Now the another way - Approach 2 - if we look at Harris Spending 10 $ every day on carrots, we can simply multiply the spending per day with the days in a year which is 365, it will come to 3650$ which is same.\n10.

By this multiplier we need to read the 250 pages. This is the same as calculating the total hour required by dividing the 250 number of pages by the rate we have.\n5. 60 pages per hour(constant rate). 250 pages/60 pages per hour = 4 hours.\n6.

If there are five girls left, then there will be 76 girls. If there are six girls left, then there would be 69 girls.\n\n4. That means there should be nine girls left, and there should be a total of 76 - 9 = 67. If there are 9 girls left, then there is 60 girls total. If there are 10 girls left, then there's 50 girls total. If you have 11 girls left, then there 42 girls total. If there's 12 girls left, then you have 33 girls total.\n\n5. If there are 76 total, and you're only talking about the girls, that means that there are 67 girls.\n\n6. The question is: \"how many girls are there?\" The answer is: 67.\n\n7.

{"text": "The answer is 65740\nIn the given problem statement, we are asked to find the number of tarantula legs in one less than 11 egg sacs of tarantulas.\n1. To start solving the problem, first divide the numbers in the given question.\n2. For eg. 5 egg sacs can = 5 x 1000 = 5000 tarantula legs. Similarly, 10 egg sacs can =10 x 100 =10000 tarantul legs.\n3. Now, if we subtract 1 from 5 and 10 respectively, we get 4 and 9 as the answers.\n4. Now, lets find out how many tarantula legs would there be if 1 tarantula egg sac contained 1000 baby tarantula legs.\n5. That gives us 1 x 100 (1000 taratantula legs). This means if one tarantula egg has 1 tarantula, then 100 tarantula eggs contain 10,000 tarantule legs.\n6. Hence, the given question can be simplified to, \u201chow many tarantula legs are in one egg sac?\u201d\n7. As the tarantula\u2019s have 8 legs per tarantula. The total number of baby tarantula legs in 1 egg sac will be the total number of legs times 8.\n8. That is 10 x 1 x 1 x 8 = 80 legs = 80.\n9. Adding we get the answer 5000 + (10 x 80) = 5080 legs in the 5 tarantula egg sac.\n10. Hence the answer is 6580 legs\n11.

{"text": "1. During one hour, Tom can cover 12 pages. The number of pages can represent time spent reading.\n2. So, if tom doubles his speed, every hour = 12 pages per hour, he would cover 32 pages per hour.\n3. This implies he would cover 4 pages in every minute or 4 pages in each 10 seconds.\n4.  For the next question we have to figure out at what rate Tom is going to cover the number of pages he covered in an hour. It would depend on the rate with which he is moving to cover those pages.\n5. It would be helpful to convert the number of pages to numbers of units to measure speed.\n6. Assuming page is equal to 1, every page is equal to unit of movement.\n7. We also know that Tom can cover 1 page per minute. So, every hour, he would cover multiple pages.\n8. To cover 32 pages in an hour, Tom should cover 2 pages in every minute, 1 page in every second.\n9. Every page represents 8-units of movement. In short, Tom's speed in the second question = (60 per hour) / (1 minute per hour) / (8 units per page) = 4 units per second of movement.\n\n10.

{"text": "The wording of the problem is slightly hard to comprehend because of the presence of technical language such as 'paired' and 'getting pregnant after matting'. But if we break down the problems, it does not contain any trickiness. A solution requires following the instructions given.\n\nThe first statement is that a zoo has 16 panda in it. We are asked to identify couples in the zoo. We can do so by identifying male pandas as 'M' and female pandas as 'F'. Then we can identify which male can mate with which female. By doing this we can say that all couples in the zoo are 'FMP', 'MMF', 'MFM', and 'FMY'.\nThere are two options for how many pandas are born:\nWe can follow the given instruction by taking a 25% chance that the two pandas will mate. The panda can have a baby if the female is pregnant after the matings. In this case there will be 2 pregnant women/pandas and 1 unpregnant person/panda for every couple. Therefore, a total of 10 pandas will have a baby.\nWe can also make a different assumption. We can assume that all couples will produce a baby. Therefore there will be 16 pregnant pandas. We can simplify this by not counting males and females together and simply counting pregnant pandas. This yields a different output from the first.\nHowever the problem is more ambiguous than this, because the problem says that a third of all pandas are capable of giving birth. However, even if a person is capable of giving birth, they may not be pregnant while they are mating. Therefore, a panda might be pregnant or they could be of the 75% of pandas who are not pregnet.\nTherefore to decide how many pandas produce babies we should take a chance and make our guess based on the probability of being pregnant. But this is not a simple process: we should not assume that every couple can have children and ignore a third of the pandas that are not capable of pregnancy.\nThe answer, therefore, is that it is ambiguous if pandas are all born in the same or the same number are born. It is a matter of personal opinion.\n\nInput:In a school with 30 kids, the following relationships are: 4 people like", "answer": " 2"}

{"text": "19.375 A: B: C: D: E: Instructions:Answer the following question. (Note that the answer is a Decimal.\nWhat is the value of w? Choices:A: 0.65 B: 0.69 C: 0.74 D: 0.76 E: 0.80\nOutput:1. The question asks to find the value of w, so we must write an expression to calculate the value of w.\n2.  w = 2v3 = 2(v4)4 = v5\n3.  So, v5 = 5/w. This means that the value of w is the reciprocal of 5/v5.\n4.  As stated in the given question, the given balloons have capacity 10 liters, so, 5/v5 = 10.\n5.  Therefore, 10/5 = w (v5/w) or v5w = 10. This means that v5 is equal to 10/w, and w can be calculated as 2*(10/v5)2 = 2(10)(10)/v52, now simplifying this gives an answer of 20002/1755 v2\n6. This can be simplified down to\n\nWedged Balloons = 7502(10002/7502 v3\n\n7. v = 3 is already known and as 7502 has already cancelled itself out above, we can now isolate w to be equal to 3\n\nw = 3 (20002 v2 / v3) or (w * v3) = 200007502 v2\n\n8. So w can be written as w = 2002 = 200(01000)2 or (12)(105)(150)\n\n9. W = (12)(1/105)(0.15) or 1.13618 which simplifies to 1.13 as that is the next higher number where we will no longer lose digits", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "1. The given problem statement revolves around the production of milk where the average production per cow is known.\n2. After we gather the above information, the next step involves figuring out how many cows must have been on the farm based on the given conditions.\n3. In the context of the problem, 'a farm' can be seen as a large area where 'on average every 6 cats produce 108liters of milk per week' and this number (108) is called the average production per cow. From this, we can arrive at the following equation:\n4. Average Production per Cow = 108 litres\n5. The next important thing is to know that the number of cows (x) on the farm, as per the problem, is such that the total milk produced by all cows (x * 6) = 2160litres and we can represent this with the following equation.\n6. Total Milk Produced by All Cows = x * (6litres)\n7. 2160 = x * (6)\n8. 216 = 6x\n9. Therefore x = (216 / 6)\n\n10.

{"text": "1. The fishmonger managed to sell 3 times more fish (about 150 kg) in the following week.\n2. Let C be the amount of fish sold by the fishmonger in the first week.\n3. We can assume that the price/kg of fish was the same for both weeks as follows:\n4. Given the data, we have the following scenario:\n5. C * 75 = 150 (since every 3rd kg from sale of C amounts to 150 kg in total),\n6. i.e., C = 75(1/3) kg or 25 kg of fish.\n7. Therefore, we know that the fishmonger managed 25 kg and then there was another sale of 125 kg of fish after that.\n8. So, using C = 25 we get 75 C + 125 = 155 kg,\n9. (75 * 75) + (125 * 3) = 155 (since 75 is 3 times 25)\n10. Thus,\n11. C = 75kg,\n12.

{"text": "1. This problem revolves around Ludwig and his work pattern.\n2. The number of days in a week is seven, so in order to get his daily salary of $ 10, Ludwig will be working during the week ( 7 * 6) or sixty hours. This means that he will work for roughly 10 + hours every day (given the assumptions of the problem).\n3. During the weekend (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) Ludwig only works half a day, i.e. ( 2 * 6) or 12 hours. This leaves him ( 10 + 12 ) ( 6 ) =38 hours free on Saturday and Sunday, which are his weekends.\n4. With the information provided about Ludwig\u2019 s earnings and work schedule, we can deduce that he does not earn salary during Fridays and Sundays on a weekly basis. Rather, he will only earn salary on the six other days of the week.\n\n5. This means that Ludwig will earn ($ 10) only five days a week, which will be:\n\nMonday : ($ 10)\nTuesday : ($ 10)*2 = 20\nWednesday : ($ 18) + 10 = 28\nThursday : 28 + $ 18 = 46\nFriday: 0\n\n6. Now, the total salary Ludwig earns in a week is \n\nMonday + Tuesday + Wednesday + Thursday + Friday : 5 days = $120\n\nTherefore, Ludwig earns $120 on Friday given the assumptions of the problem.\n6. Hence, the possible answers are 6, 12, 38, and 46.\n\n7. Ludwig works 7 days a weak  and he earns $10 for half of the day on Friday.

{"text": "1. \n2. In the following problem, we are presented with a situation where a boxer must lose weight by dieting and weighs 99 kg at 4 months before a fight with a final target weight of 90 kg on the day of the match.\n3. The solution lies in identifying the rate at which weight is lost, so that the final weight can be calculated.\n4. Let us denote the monthly weight loss rate in kg as 'a':\n5. Thus,\n  * a * 3 = -4\n    * We can write a = -4/3\n6. a = - 4/3, it can be solved as: \n  * - 4 = 3a \n    * The above equation, simplified gives:\n    * -5 = 3a  ( 1)\n7. The monthly weight loss rate = -5\n8. a= -1/3 months\n9. The total weight would be: -1/3 times 6 months before the fight or -1/3*3 months = -1/3 months + 3 months = -1 months before the fight\nSo the final answer for the query is: -1.\n\nInput:The boxer weighs __ kg. \nOutput:1.

Therefore, to solve the riddle, we must first discard \u2018definitely\u2019.\nNow, we can understand the remaining four words to be \u201cnot\u201d + \u201cI\u201d + \u201cwould take\u201d + \u201cthat route\u201d.\n\u201cI would take\u201d is a subordinate clause; it doesn\u2019t serve a standalone function in the sentence. The subordinate \u2018I would take\u2019 has two options that connect to it: verb or not-verb. \u201cI will take\u201d is a verb but a subordinate one. Therefore, we can eliminate all the verbs that come after \u201cI would\u201d in our list.\nThe sentence cannot end with \u201cI am not confident about it\u201d. The question refers to the sentence after the phrase \u201cI don\u2019t wish to \u2026\u201d. Therefore, the rest of the sentence has a verb, and we can eliminate \u201cabout it\u201d from our list.\nTo be certain that it is a sentence, it must be divided into 2 sentences. We can split it into 2 sentences by adding a comma after \u201ca particular course of action\u201d and splitting the second half of the sentence into 2 parts. The second half of the sentence can be split into parts only because it has one part in which \u201c\u2026 (that) I know will be difficult\u201d.

Now putting it this way the input says we have 100 cookies. \n3. We take 100 cookies out of the batch and put those cookies in the jar. \n4. So 2 days later when we take second batch of Cookie out of cookie jar we find that it is stale and 2 days after that we find that these first two cookies are also stale so that means we have to take out first 3 Cookies out of the jar each time so that they don\u2019t go stale.\n5. So the 3rd time we would have taken out the first 5 cookies that is we would have taken out 3 in the first batch and 4 in the second and 5th batch and by", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "1. The show has 20 episodes of 30 minutes each which makes 1000 minutes.\n2. The problem can be restated as how many hours does he need to watch a day so that in all 5 days, each episode is watched once?\n3. This amounts to watching 20 episodes in 5 days and each episode having 1000/50 min/day watch time duration.\n4. We can calculate the watch time of each episode as 1000/(50/60) = 16.66666 hours.\n\n5. So in a day, he would have to watch 4 episodes - that is, 16.67/4 per day in order to finish the show in 5 days, making 4 episodes with 16.6 hour watch time per day the correct answer.\n6.

But Barkley is not a good chaser, and he only chases a dog that is much faster or larger. For example, if the dog goes at full speed (or if another faster dog is on the other side of the street), Barkley won\u2019t be able to catch it at all. But if the dog is smaller and doesn\u2019t go too fast, Barkley might catch up with it and bite it. So if you know the size and speed of the dog you\u2019re running from, can you say if Barkley would be able to catch it? Answer choices were: \n- Always - Barkley only chases larger dogs, and the cat he saw was small.\n- Always - The cat was too small for Barkley to catch.\n- Maybe - If the dog were faster, Barkley would chase the cat.\n- Maybe - \nIf the dog were bigger, Barkley would catch it.\n- Never - \nBarkley only runs after faster, bigger dogs.\nSo the corrent answer is A: Always \n\nInput: Alison was the only person to stay for the whole show.

What was the original dimensions of the old windows?\nOutput: \n1.In this case Jane has 4 identical windows of the same dimensions, the question is to calculate the dimensions of the original window. \n2.To calculate the dimensions of the old window, to compare the dimension of the original window and the dimension of the new window, \n3.The original window has to be the sum of the dimensions of the new window.\n4.We do the following steps to achieve this,\n5.Step 1) We can see that the original window plus the new window should equal the original window.  If we divide each side of the window by two, then the length and height can be calculated as below\n6.If the total length and height of the window is 5ft, the width and thickness can be calculated as below.\n7.Step 2.) We can now subtract the dimensions of the old windows from the dimensions of the new windows\n8.The dimensions of the old windows are (7*6+2) and the width is 5*10 and the thick is 1/2\n9.The length and height of the new window is 1, 5, 1.

When one does that on the basis of the statement, it becomes clear that only two conditions are required information: the number of balls Ryan has and the proportion of colors among them. \n\nFirst, it is not given if Ryan's balls are distributed equally among the three colors, nor is there any information about the number of other kinds of balls. Hence, we are aware that there are 40 balls and 11 blue balls.  The rest of the information pertains only to the balls. \n\nSecond, there are twice as many red as blue (1/2 of all balls are red). Hence, there must be at least 11 red balls and at least 55 blue.  The balls number will follow by a simple multiplication of the two numbers.  There may be more blue than 55 or more green than 20, but no green, yellow or white balls are possible.  The number of all balls will then simply be the sum of these two numbers.  \n\nInput:[ { \"code\": \"#\",  \"name\":  \"A\" },  { \"code\": \"C\", \"name\": \"B\" },  { \"name\": \"C\" } ]\nOutput: The function \"name\" returns the name of the object passed into the function (which is the key of an object). \n\nInput:[ \"a\", \"b\" ]\nOutput: It doesn't matter what data types you pass to \"map\", so either data type will work.

{"text": "1. We need to calculate how many points Paislee needed to have to ensure that she was now in the lead.\n2. Paislee could tie Calvin with atleast 75 points( 3/4 * 500 ). The only way to tie was for Paislee to get 75 points and Calvin to get less than 500 which was not possible.\n\n3. So Paislee was already at least 300 points behind Calvin and needed more points.\n4. We know that Paislee needed 75 points to tie.\n5. 75 = 500 * <x>\n6. There are two possibilities to calculate the value of x.\n7. a) x = 0 which implies no points. It is not possible for Paislee to tie the game if she scores no points at all. Therefore x \u2260 0\n8. b) x = 500, which implies that Paislee scored exactly the same number of points as Calvin or she scored 50 points more. Both ways it is possible for Paislee in this case.

Since we want Paislee to score more points we have to find out the value of x which is smaller than 500 and therefore it has to be 300 since 50/300 = 1/16.\n11. Hence we can conclude that if X = 300 then either Calvin's score would have to be 400 or Paislee would have to score 800 points to tie the game since (500*300)/4 = 16.

The word class in the sentence is a singular, and so it refers to a single entity or concept.\n2. However, since the speaker is contrasting 'always getting good grades' with 'never managing to get an A', it can be interpreted that the class referred to is a plural.\n3. The sentence is also ambiguous as the word 'I' is plural and pronouns like 'I' and'me' refer to one person when used in a sentence.\n4. The word 'grade' in the sentence can be interpreted as a singular or plural. If it is interpreted as a singular, then it is possible that the sentence means 'I always get good grates, but...'. In this case, the question arises regarding the subject of the negative clause.\n5. There are three possible options here, namely:\n6.'I','me' or'my'. Since'my' is followed by 'grade', it can be interpreted as referring to a thing or possession owned by the subject of the sentence.\n7. This in turn implies that the person owned the plural 'grades' and is talking about the grades owned by him/her as a thing or possession or a collection of things or possessions.\n8. If this interpretation is correct, it is possible that the question mark is an error and what the sentence really means are: I always get good grades, but for some reason I can never, ever manage to get an A. In this case, the sentence could be rewritten as:\n9. I always get good grates (plural) but my grades do not permit me to ever get an A, which is a better interpretation.\n10. However, this does not answer the original question, which is 'why I would get good grades but never get an A'.\n\nInput:I am a great mathematician, I guess, but what is a mathematician?\nOutput:1.

{"text": "The solution is C $15.38. Carla needs to drive 8, 6 and 12 miles to three different locations for her errands. She has to cover the same distance for her kid's return as well, hence the distance travelled becomes 38 miles (8+6 and 12+12+12). We know that Carla's car gives 25 mpg but her gas tank contains 15.5 gallons. Hence, we can see that per mile Carla uses 1.34 gallons. Substituting this information to calculate gas required, we know that 38 * 1.34 = 50.18 gallons. We know that Carla is going to pay $2.50 per gallon, therefore Carla will pay (50.18 *2.50) which gives 126.39 US dollars. Since Carla has a 15.5-gallon tank, she will have 8.6365 gallons in her tank. Substituting for that, we know that there is (126.35/8.64) gallons left in the tank which gives around 15.05 gallons.

We have to break up the plants into 18 groups of 7 tomatoes each and see how this number changes after Andy undertakes the harvesting process.\n3. To begin with, Andy needs to harvest all of the tomatoes from each plant to get a total of 126 tomatoes. \n4. Now, Andy has to take 1/2 of the total of tomatoes, that is 63, and turn it into marinara sauces that can yield 19.91444444 kg of sauce based on information from our given data. \n5. This leaves 63-19.91/4=43.11788889 kg of tomatoes left. Now that is just for the case of 126 plants. Andy needs to harvest 18 of those plants, each giving him out 7 tomatoes, that is total of 124 tomatoes. \n6. Andy now has to turn 63 out of 124 into 19.9 to produce 174 tomatoes left.

If this trend continues, 97% of mankind will have large feet in 10 years, and 80% will have small feet.\nOutput: 11\n2. For the sake of time, let's forget about the other 10%, the 0.97 that has small feet.  \n\n3. We can think of the feet as either large or small relative to one another.  In 10 years (t-10), if 80% of man kind had small feet, then this means that 20 percent of the population still had small feet.\n4. In 10-20% years, or 1989,  80% of mankind had small feet, and 20% of the population, or 80% of this is 16%, had large feet, or 64% had small feet.\n5. In 100-16=84 years, or 10 years later, half of this 16%, or 8%, had large feet.\n6.

{"text": "10 inches  The problem presents a sequence of events in a snowstorm, where progressively more snowfall occurs.\n2. We are asked to determine how deep the snowdrift was at the end of the day.\n3. The snowdrift was 12 inches deep on the first day and 24 inches deep at the beginning of the second day, after the snowfall on the first day.\n4. In addition, it is mentioned that half of the drift melted on the second day.  This means that at the start of the second day, the drift is 24 + 12 = 36 inches deep (taking into consideration the initial depth of 12 inches).\n5. Furthermore, it snowed 18 inches on the third day, adding another 18 inches to the total height of the drift.\n6. Thus, the height of the drift was 36 + 18 = 54 inches deep at the start of the fourth day.\n7. Finally, in addition to the 18 inches of additional snowfall on the fourth day, half of the drift also melted, reducing the total depth of the drift to 54 + 9 = 63 inches.\n8.

She has six days a week to finish her job, and she will be paid for every document she checks. This means she gets paid for at most six days of work. How much will she earn in her job? (The six days are not consecutive days, so the 315th day is not also the 316th, and so on)\nOutput: The salary of Judy will be $232,000.\nSolution: The maximum days the employee will work for in her job will be 315 and the number of documents she needs to check will be 2500.

Let's look at the options.\n3. A: None of these: This can't be the option. Because the question clearly says, \"the relationship between the sister and mother is mentioned\".\n4. B. Mother is greater in Age: Clearly states the mother is either elder or equal in age. The description of the sister explicitly states that she is a bossy type of a person; hence, for her to be a 'boss' she needs to be older to be a boss. Therefore, this option can also be eliminated.\n5. C: Equal to the mother: We cannot rule out the fact that both the sister and mother can be equals i.e. both are the same age. But according to the description of sister, she is bossy and so, she cannot be of the same age as the mother. So, this cannot be the case. This option can also be eliminating.\n6.

One month consists of 31days. Assuming each day takes 1 day to complete and is the case throughout all the months, 88 days is spent on travel. This means that Mary travelled for (88days*=28days). 3 states can be travelled for 28 days.\n7) This leads to a possible explanation that Mary has been to the three states on each month.\n8) Assuming Mary has completed 9 months so far this year and has a least 3 states left,", "answer": " 39"}

A shepherd who is hired by the farm owners, drives the sheep away from the farm. However, the sheep wander into the field where cows are being fattened and graze for half a day at a rate of 75 kg of grass per sheep per day. If the sheep graze for 22.5 hours, then how much grass will the sheep destroy in the field, which is the size of a football field? Assume they graze in a circular formation.\nOutput: 1875 kg\n##### Solution:This problem contains an analogy between cows, sheep and football fields. We can first solve the problem to find out how much of grass cows eat each day. And then solve again using the analogy. The question states that there are 810 sheep and 60 fewer sheep means that there are 750 sheep. When the sheep move into the field, it says that for half a day at the rate of 75,000 kg of grass per sheep. Let's say there are 1000 sheep. Then 810 sheep = 750 sheep so the 22.5 means that that is how much time they graze on that field for, thus, 75,045 g of grass", "answer": " 7425"}

She makes 10 trials.  How many balls did she produce?\nOutput:She produced 20 balls.\n\n### Input explanation:\n1. A woman will produce any combination of 2, 4, 6 or 8 balls out of all the 8 balls she has.\n1. The probability of producing 20 balls is then 8 * (2/8) + (4/8) + (6/8) + (8/8) which gives 2.\n### Explanatation:\n1. In this context, trial means a ball from her. Since by nature she should not have more than 2 balls in one row, for n of her trials: 1 balls will only yield 2 balls, and 2 or more balls will yield no balls.\n2. A ball is produced when one ball is removed from a 8 ball combination at each trial, where there are 8 different combinations or 8!/1 balls = (8*7*6*5*4*3)(1/8) = 1/128\n3. All possible combinations: 16 balls, 20 balls. 19 balls, 22 balls. 12 balls, 9 balls.\n4. For the case when we get 16 balls, by our formula the probability is 1/121", "answer": " 45"}

{"text": "1. This is a question regarding Lake Crystal having 20% less frogs than Lassia Lake. This does not involve any calculations and it is quite basic. 2.The first step is to understand the relationship between the number of frogs in Lake Crystal and in the total of the two lakes. If Lake Crystal has 20% lesser frogs then total number of frogs in the two lakes is 20% less than the total number of frogs which are present in Lake Crystal. 3.Now, we have to find the total number of froggies in Lake Crystal. Since lake crystal has 20 % less frogs, there are 20% less number of frogs in lake crystal, which means there are 20 64/100 = 20/5= 4 frogs less. Lets call this # = (4/10) froggies. 4. Now the total number of frogies in the two lakes, which we want to find is 46(total in Lassia lake) - 4(total number in lake crystal). 46- 4 = 42 42 100 = 900 frogs.

We have to find the daily amounts of fish Ittymangs has to give each member based on the given scenario, where,Oomyakpeck gives himself 11 eyes and their dog gets 11 eyes by them giving him 22 eyes.\n3.  The given scenario suggests that each member of the family gets to eat equal amounts of fish each day (based on the assumption that no fish is wasted).\n4.  So we have to find an equation that considers the total fish given to everyone each day and the total number of eyes given to each member.\n5.  To answer this question, we note that :\n                            Oomyapeck gives himself 22 eyes.  This means Oomyapeck takes 22 more eyes (each day).\n                            Ittymangs takes out 11fish per member after 22 eyes are taken by Oomyapeck, thus:\n5 fish * (for one eye taken by Oomya) = 3 * (for two eyes taken by Oomya), which can be rearranged to give: 3(for two eyes taken by him).

{"text": "104 (square feet)\n### Explanation:\nThe question involves identifying the amount of material remaining and the relationship between the size of material required with the length and width of the respective areas it will be used in.\n### Instructions for question:\n1. Ann is cutting fabric for curtains of living room and bed room.\n2. The length of living room curtains (as given in data) is 4 feet by 4 feet while the length of bedroom curtains is 2 feet by 2 feet (the width of the cloth is given).\n3. Ann needs 16 feet by the cloth as she is making the curtains of (living room and bedroom).\n4. Hence using the principle of distributive property (it is a property of rational numbers, which states that the quantity obtained by multiplying two or more quantities together remains unchanged, when each of the factor quantities is multiplied by the same non-zero quantity).\n5. 16 feet = 1 x (4 feet by 4 ) = 2 x (4 feet by2) \n4 x (4 feet by4) = 32 feet by 4 feet\n6. We need to identify the remaining cloth as the length and width of cloth (16 feet by 2 feet) is greater than the cloth of the room (12 feet by 42 feet) (as the length and width of curtains for living room is a lesser length when compared to the cloth purchased for making the curtains).\n7. Thereafter, multiplying every 4 to the length, we get the total fabric left as 6 x 4 = 24 square feet of fabrics.\n8. Similarly, when we multiply every 2 for width, the total fabric left is 4 x 2 = 8 square feet\n9. Hence, summing both the values: 24 + 8, the fabric left is 32 square feet.\n\n### Data:If 3,925,970 \u00f7 1,741 = 2,188, 1,744 \u00f7 3,926 = 467, what percent of 1,746 do 467 and 2,185 make?\nOutput: 61.3", "answer": " 160"}
{"text": "1. To answer the question, we need to figure out the total number of non-roses flowers out of the total number of flowers.\n2.  We can identify roses by the prefix 'rose' which is common to 'roses' and 'rose' thus differentiating them from the rest.\n3.  The same holds true for tulips and daisies whose prefixes are 'tulip' and 'daisy' respectively.\n4.  As a result, we can conclude that all flowers that are not roses(i.e. tulips and daises) can be identified.\n5. It should be noted that this doesn't mean that all tulips and daisy are present in the garden since they could be absent but are not roses.\n6. We therefore assume that when we take the total number of flowers(25 roses+40 tulip+35 daisies) to identify the roses, that they cover the entire population and that there are no absent tulip and daisy.\n7. From here, we simply have to ask the question, what percentage of the total number of flower(25roses+40tulip+35daisies) is rose? Or, 'what percentage of the total number is not tulips/daisy'.\n8. This will be the answer that we are looking for. Now, we can further simplify this calculation by breaking down the total amount that we are given.  The total number of flowers(in this case) is 25 roses + 40 tulip + 35 daisy.\n9.  We can then further break it down and make it more manageable to understand. 25 roses: this part accounts for 100% of roses and also 20% out of the total percentage of flowers that are roses. This is therefore, the part that accounts for roses.\n10.  Likewise, for tulips we have a similar approach but breaking it down into the portion of the flowers that aren't roses: 40 tulipes: 60% of tulips(40 tulip / 65 total flowers) accounts for 10% of the total numbers of flowers which also includes roses.\n11.

{"text": "Solution:The weight of John\u2019s cow increased by a factor of 1.5.It has increased its weight by 400 pounds as 400 is 1.5 times 266 pounds. The weight of John\u2019s Cow is 1076 pounds.  We know the weight in pounds is 1077.\nJohn sold 8180 pounds of this weight and the cost price of 8180 pound is 28,096 dollars. 8180/3 is 2726 dollars that is the amount of gain on selling the cow.\nHence the gain is 2729.24 dollars.\n1.1 The first question asks how much more is it worth and the problem states the value of this cow (1.5 times its original weight) and its gain in weight. If John increases the weight of the cow by x factor and increases its value to y, this means that he only made y into his original x and is selling the cow for this price.\n\n2.1 It's a given that John sells his cow for $3 per lb.\n\n3.1 Thus John's gain when he sells his cow is (x*3), because he made the cow weigh more, he will surely sell it for more. We know his cow only weighs 1076 (x) and if he sells it for 1.5x then he'll make y.\n\n4.1 This means that to make his 1076 lb cow have a value of 1.5(1076) lb he would have to make it weigh more than 1076 and sell it at the cost of 3 per lb.\nThis problem is about making the weight of something greater than the original 1076.\n\n5.1 To do this, increase the original 1000/1.5, we'll find that by using this new rate he can only make it weigh 1076x/x to remain at the same original weight. This new weight that it is 1075.56 lbs (approx).\nThis shows that to make it worth 1.5x it has to weigh more than 813.5 (1076/1", "answer": " 600"}

As before, we subtracted 8 from 40 to arrive at 32, the amount of crayons left to in this case, so no matter how we solve for the last box, we always end up with a remainder. Multiplication/division does nothing. So, we are left with 32 used crayons, which is the amount of crayon she had left in the first box. This means that she used everything in the first box, and 2 crayons from the second box.\nThis leaves us with only one box remaining, containing 32 crayon.

It takes 2,000 sales at $20,750 to pay $4,000,000 to start a company that designs cars.\nOutput: 20,75\n2. Explaniation: The first part of the passage refers to the costs of a car. The second part refers to the number of sales they get to make the money that they need. The third states this formula (2,000*20,75 = 4,000000).\nThe fourth line states that they need to sell 2,00 cars for 20,50, and from that, we can infer that 1500/20,75 is 73.95. If the car costs $20500, then they must make 73 cars, for the total cost of $150000.\nSo the final price for each price is 20,78355\n\nInput: Three friends had a pizza-themed party and each friend paid $34, $12, and $51 for their total bill.

The $3 for Bob must be what each sandwhich is worth ($8), but then how much does each sandwich cost them? $3. Let's say $3 is for the cost of the sandwich itself. So $3+$3=$6 per sandwich.\n5.

I am stuck at the bakery with a bad case of diarrhea.\"  He spent the day at a hospital near by.  Next day too, her school bus did not come and her father had to pick her up.  The man was annoyed, wondering what to do about this. Then, one day an advertisement came in the newspaper, appealing for the children who have been missed by the school bus for the past two days and wanted them to meet the bus driver.  When the boy went to the meeting, he found that the bus driver was in reality his daughter's mother who was taking her to school. The woman apologised and informed the man that she had been waiting for the van to come for her daughter.\nOutput:1. Now we can form a logical answer by breaking down the question. We have the bus driver, 2 mothers and both daughters, and a man who is either confused or does not understand the situation.\n2", "answer": " 25"}

The director, who just quit the company, wrote the original book for this play.  The actor, who now plays the lead in the the play, wrote the original music to fit with the book.  A 13-piece band composed the original music to go with the actors' and director's work.  An old theater owner wrote the original script to fit with the actors and musical.  It is assumed that the play being produced now is a direct reflection of the original script since the owner died 110 years ago.  How long did the old theater owner live?

This clue suggests that the original script will have to match the original actors & their work i.e. both the actors (who were originally the writers) should hold the same characteristics as the original director and playwright. (who wrote the original script).\n2. To determine the answer, we can go about this problem in two ways:\n3. First, we can use the mathematical principle of division. We are told we need to divide an 110-year \u201cspan\u201d into an \u201cappropriate period\u201d for one of the original writers, and then also divide an \u201cappropriate\u201d period into an 11-year period. Finally, we need that the remainder of a 11-year \u201cspan\u201d be equal to the \u201cexact time\u201d which we are missing \u2014 the additional amount of time that the new director and the new actor need to make the play equal the original. Hence, the missing time = 110-11(11) = 79 years. The original writer of the play must have lived for more than 79 years.\n4. Second, if this", "answer": " 1500"}

{"text": "1. The problem involves a 16 mile long road being built by a roadwork company, using a mixture of asphalt and gravel.\n2. We are asked to calculate how many bags of gravell the company would need to complete the entire road (3 times the amount of 16 miles).\n3. The initial number of bags needed is 3 * 16 = 48 which may not be a whole number, thus we will need to round it up to the next integer. For this we can use the following formula: n=(n+1)^1/2-1\n4. Applying this formula: 27.5\n5. We know that each truck needs 2 bags of gravel, therefore we can say that each truck will use a total of 48 truckloads.\n6. One truckload is made of 16 miles (of 3 miles each) and 5 times the number of bags of gravel than bags of pitch and we know that we are left with 18 so 18/5 = 3.6 which is rounded down to 3. We therefore multiply 48 by 3 to obtain the total number of truckloads needed to pave the entire road.\n7. The second day's work consisted of one mile less than double the original amount and if we were to apply the equation again: n=(n*2+1)^1/4-1 we would get 123.1 in this case.\n8. The first part of the question is the number of barrels required to pave 48 miles.\n9. Substitute 48 in the original equation, we get n = 48 * 2. Now to divide them by 3 we multiply by 3 since barrel contains 3 bags.\n10. We get 62.1\n11. We have to get the number of barrel needed for finishing the remaining 18 miles on the third day. Deducting that from what we have we have 48 * 5-62.1 = -12.9 which is a negative number.\n12. Since the barrels of pitch are negative, we have to subtract it from the negative number in the 4th barrels of pitch. We get -5.8", "answer": " 6"}

And the pool will remain with a value of around 14.\n\u2022 Since there are 24 candies total in the bucket, after they all consume, each will get 1 more\n\nThere is also another very interesting way to approach this:\n\n\u2022 Jacob and Lana are a pair and can only take a fixed amount of candy each.\n\u2022 However Nellie is a solo", "answer": " 3"}

In addition, Sam and Jack together covered the work of 12 hours as Jack, in the capacity of a loading dock worker, had to help unload the newly-arrived widget materials.\n4. When Tony joined in, he had just completed his duties for the 8-hour shift and the remaining work was covered by Sam and Jack who could collectively do so in the remaining time.\n5. The important information to note is that Sam, Jack and Tony together could cover the remaining work in the remaining time. This is because Jack was able to finish the job by working for the additional 15 minutes as he helped Sam and Tony.\n6. When doing a 2-step job in 3 steps, if it takes Jack 15 minutes more than Sam, then it takes him 60 minutes.\n7. Hence in total taking 3x15 + 2x10 = 150 minutes or 2.5 hours more.\n8.

{"text": "11. Firstly, we'll solve the given problem.\n12. We have information that Andy weighed 156 pounds at the beginning of the Year.\n13. Further, during the year he had grown 3 inches and gained some weight.\n14. However by the last 3 months of the year he had decided to exercise.\n15. During the 3 months he lost an eighth each month, such that at the end of the year his weight was 158 pounds (since he lost an eighth, the answer should be rounded).\n16. Next we will solve the questions that follow the instructions as provided in the text.\n17. Based on the question, we have some required information: Andy weighed 11 pounds less at the end of the 3 months than what he did before.\n18. However, there are additional requirements to be considered while answering the question: Andy started out the year wearing 11 pounds less than what he did at the end of the period of 3 months.\n19. That is to say, Andy weighed 105 pounds (156-11+36) at the beginning of the period and 94 pounds (158-11) at the end of the same period.\n20. Consequently, following the initial statement of the problem (that Andy weighed 12 pounds less at the end than at the beginning), we know that for the same period in which he lost 12 pounds, he added 38 pounds in total (105+156).\n21. Substituting 38 for 12, we can conclude that Andy started out weighing 12 pounds more than what he weighed at the end.\n22. However, by the end of the period he weighed less total (105 pounds before exercise+38 pounds during exercise=143 pounds. 12 pounds before/after the period of exercise was 143-24=119 pounds.\n23. So, Andy weighs 158-105=53 pounds more than what he did at first.\n24. Consequently, the answer is an option D.\nSo the answer to the final question is option D\n\nInput: There are 12", "answer": " 36"}

After we make an assumption that her phone bill is equal to 10% of Food budget, we can put the two equations together to get 50% of total budget - 10% of total budget = phone bill.\n6. So now, the value of phone bill is 40% of total budget and, therefore, is $96.00\n7. So her total monthly budget would be equal to $240-96+$240, which equals $324.00. This would be the answer if she is paying a total bill of $324 to cover all three expenses\n8. So the final answer would be: $324\n\nInput: The cost of building a shed was 30% more than the cost of building an outdoor grill. The shed was 175% the price of the outdoor grill. How much did they pay for the shed?\nOutput:1) The problem requires us to figure out what was the total sum paid for the shed.\n2) The first step is to solve for the cost of the shed.\n3) As we know from the given information that the cost of building a shed is 30% more and 175% of building an outdoor Grill.\n\n\n4) There is no problem if we simply multiply the values to get the cost. However, we need to find the total cost of these costs.\n5) Using the formula to calculate the total cost\nTotal cost of two different items = (price of first item) * (1 + profit made on first item)\n\n\n6) In this case, shed cost is $10.35 * 1.3 = $13.47", "answer": " 249"}

{"text": "1. Every day of the week Harry takes his dogs out for a walk.\n2. On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, 7 dogs are taken out for a walk and on those days he gets paid five dollars.\n3. On Tuesdays, he takes 12 dogs out on walk, earning him 60 dollars.\n4. On Thursdays, 9 dogs are taken out for walk, earning him another 45 dollars.\n5. At the end of the week he takes in 135 dollars which means he walks a total of 28 dogs, of them earning $5 each time.\n6. We know that he charges $5 per dog and takes 135 dogs out on walk.\n7. Now using this information we can answer the question asked in the problem statement. \n8. To answer the question we need to calculate the total number of walks Harry gives.\n9. To calculate the total number of dog walks Harry gives, multiply the total number of dogs (28) by the number of days (7) that he is taking these dogs out every week.\n10. We know that he takes 135 dos on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.  So we multiply the numerator by 5 and the denominator by 7.\n11. Now, by taking the above-given figure of 324 dog walks as the total number of dog-walks, we easily can easily find the dogs Harry walks on Monday, Friday and Wednesday.\n12. We know that he walks 7 dogs each day on Monday, Friday and on Wednesday.\n\n\nOutput:4. Now we know that Harry walks 7, 135 and 7 dogs every Monday, Friday and Wedne, respectively. To find out how much money he earns each day, we need to take the difference between the number of walks Harry takes (7) and the amount of money he gets paid ($5). For finding out this, we will find the LCM of numbers 7 and 5 and then divide this number by the difference of the number of dogs\nHarry takes on a particular day.\n\nInput: 1.

The reason is that they may not know that they are mentally ill and that their mental condition has been so bad for so long that they are no longer quite sure what is normal.\nOutput: 1.  The number of people affected in this way is difficult to estimate because of the difficulties in determining when a particular behavior is actually abnormal.\n2. The term \"mentally affected\" as used in this sentence can mean affected in terms of behavior or affected in terms of emotional and psychological well-being.\n3. The mental condition of these people is considered abnormal and they are unable to recognize it as such. In other words, they may not realize that their mental state is abnormal or unusual which makes it difficult to determine how affected they actually are.\n4.

To determine the total income, we need to calculate the total number of tickets sold (500) and the price of each ticket ($20).\n8. With that, we calculate the total income as follows:\n9. (500 x $20) = 10,000 dollars\n10. Total income = 12,700 dollars\n11. Hence, the total expenses = $ 2,700 and the total income = 12700 dollars.\n12. He makes a net profit of $100 or 1000 dollars.\nSo the final answe is: $1000 Dollar", "answer": " 8798"}

{"text": "1. The problem is about surveying school students to find out their preference for Halloween themed bags, and using the answers to allocate certain costs.\n2. At first glance, it's not easy to decipher what the problem is ultimately about. But after a closer observation, we can see that the problem boils down to allocating the least possible cost.\n3. To solve it, first we can easily identify what we know. We know that there are 2 kinds of Halloween themed bag: vampire and pumpkin. We understand there are 5 bags inside each pack as well as 1 bag of each theme. \n\n4. The survey showed that out of 14 students who preferred pumpkins, 11 of them chose the pack of 5 bags; while out of the 9 students who preferred vampires, 10 of them chose the pack. \n5. Then, we can see that 11 pumpkin bags can be obtained for a total cost of 5*$3; and 10 vampires can be obtained for a cost of 5*$1. \n6. At this point, we can assume that we'll be able to satisfy every student's preference by buying a pack of 5 and getting an extra bag for every student. To this end, we want to know what combination of packs and extra bags will result in the least cost in total.\n7. To figure it out, we'll use a method where we plug in all possible values to calculate the total cost. So for the first 10 students who all prefer pumpkins, we buy one pack of 5 bangs for a total cost of $15. For the next 14 students who all prefer pinkins, we buy another pack of 5 for a total cost of another $15. For one more student who wants pumpkin-theming, we buy another 5 for a total of $1. Like this, we repeat the process for the next 10 students who prefer vampires.\n8. Upon closer look at the output, it can be seen that for all possible values of student preference, we'll get the least possible quantity of bags, resulting in the desired lowest cost. \n\nThe final answer is \n\nD.

Now, to solve this math problem, we need to formulate the given information in form of an equation to satisfy the given constraints.\n\n2. To figure out how to proceed, we can use the following steps:-\n  a) The first thing we do to solve such a problem is to express the variable quantities as 'x' and other non-variable values as 'y'.\n  b) Once we have decided on the variable, now we use it as a subject in our equations so that we can plug or substitute any quantity with an equation.\n  c) To formulate the equation for which we have to satisfy the given constraints, we first need to find out the total number of eggs needed.\n  d) The total number of eggs needed = (number of eggs for omelets)*'x' and add 25 extra eggs.\n  e) Taken the total number of eggs required as 'e', our equation will become-(number or eggs per omelet)*x + 25 =e.\n  f) Here, for 1 egg omelet, 'x' will represent 'half omelet' which will be equal to 'y * 0.5'. Now, replace this new value of y in the given equation of 'e'.\n3. After simplification, our equation turns out to be y * 0.5 + 25 = \nFor simplicity, let us assume 'y' as 50.\ny*0.5 + 50 =e\nx = y - 50\n  Now to find out the number of eggs per omelet, substitute the value of x to the equation of y,\n\n  In the above equation, we can notice that the number of eggs per 50-omelet is equal to 0.2.\n4. Substituting the value of eggs per omelets to the given equation, our final equation will be -(0.5) * (25) + 25 = e\n5. Therefore, our final solution will be 25 eggs.", "answer": " 584"}

{"text": "1. Johnny has been playing guitar for quite some time.\n2. To start with, it is given that Johnny currently practices for some time and this is called 'current practice'. Now he practices the same amount each time he is called into action. Now, what is meant to happen is that John's 'current practice' would increase by half each day and after 20 days he would have half as much practice as his 'current practice'.\n3. Now he has to increase by 3 times the current amount which would mean that he would take in all available practice sessions and if he is already practicing for 72 days it would take him 3*72 days to get to his target.\n4. The word \"As\" in \"As of 20 days Ago\" implies \"Before\". The question would be solved if I had only half as much practice as I do at the present i.e. \"currently.\"\n5. If 'Currently' was 72 days then this means that it will take 72/4 = 18 days to reach practice.\n6. But Johnny practiced for 72 hours/7, meaning that if Johnny practices for 72 days, he would have to practice for 10 hours a day.\n7. But this means 36 hours, or 110minutes, but this means that if Johnny practiced for 20 days he used 6 or 7 hours more than he was supposed to, meaning that it took longer than expected to do what was supposed to be done in 20 days but not 20 hours.\n8. He practices the same amount every day. If 'currently' doesn't reflect the amount of time that I have practiced, then I need to find out how long it will be and then just add that to the amount of time I have practiced.\n9. If the amount of time I practice is 3 hours every x days then the 'currently' would be a number that is 2x less than 3 hours so it would be 1.5 hours a day.\n10.

The answer depends upon the amount that Tony got. If Tony got $3520 (I), then it means that Ken also got $352. This is not correct since we know that Ken got $150.\n5. Hence, the amount that Tony got had to be even i.e. $1875 (II), and Ken got $15,125.\n6. Since both numbers are even, it implies that the amount was shared evenly.

By doing this, we are implying that after he's done with all his odd jobs, he would have the exact amount that he needs to pay for his supplies (i.e he is debt-free).\n8) In short, we need to find how many odd jobs he has to do in every month to do 3 and be debt-free at the end of the 4 months. This is equivalent to asking what needs to be done so that when we divide 3 by 4, we get 0.\n9) To calculate this easily, we multiple 100 by 3(4) / 4(4) (since this is equivalent to the above problem). \n10) In this way, we get 25 or an average of 6.25 odd jobs for each month to be debt-free. \n11) The most appropriate answer would be '6.25' since it is the easyest to calculate and is the one that makes sense in context.\n12) Thus, the above sentence is to be interpreted as 'Gerald shoveling, raking, mowing laws to save some money to buy his baseball supplies.

We can break it up in two cases:\n\n5. Case 1: Assume we divide each day in two parts and we write 10 pages at a day, it would hence take 3 days, or 30 pages written, i.e., 20 pages a days. A book has 400 pages and we have gone 100 pages for one book. So we will write for 3 days as required to write each book. Hence, he would write three book each in 3 days.\n6. Case 2: This is the situation when he write 20 pages for the full day, so it will take him one day to write 2 books. Hence, he would take (1+1) days to write each of 3 books.\n7. So, it isn't possible to write 3 books in one day and to solve this we can use the answer from case 2.

This means that after every specific time interval, the snail would travel a specific distance in an average.\n3-We can apply Newton's Law of motion, which states that Force, acting on mass, changes the velocity of the mass. It is given by $$\\mathrm F=m\\ \\mathrm a$$ Where m = Mass and a = Acceleration.\n\n4-Newton's second law states that the acceleration is directly proportional to the force F applied on mass.

This is when the weight starts to feel lighter again as you bring it down. When Tom lifts 10 plates of 30 pounds, they feel 20 % heavier. But if Tom lifts 1 plate of 30 pounds instead of 10 plates, 20% will not feel 20%.

{"text": "3. Square footage is determined by width (in feet) multiplied by the height (in feet). The present that needs the most wrapping requires three-quarters the amount needed for both of the other presents when added together. Subtract 4 square feet of wrapping paper from 8. Now, multiply the answer by the height of the other presents (both multiplied together) to the height of the one needing the most wrapping for an answer of 13. This was the height from the first step of the process. Divide the amount of wrapping paper needed by the amount required for the most amount of wrapping, to result in two-fifths of a square foot. Multiply this answer by the height requirement of the presents to result in 15.5 square feet. The answer is a total of 19 square feet, making option A incorrect.\n\nInput: Carrie is wrapping three birthdays gifts. One present needs two-thirds of a square foot of wrapping paper to cover the width of the package. The second present needs double that amount. The third needs the same amount as all the other gifts combined. How many square feet does Carrie need for the presents?\nOutput:7. The process for determining square footage is as follows: the length of the width, squared (length of width times the length of width divided by two). Carrie needs three-fourths the amount required for all the gifts combined, multiplied the length of width of the package for the first present, and, double that answer, to the length of the two for the present. Take the answer to the width of the length of the width for the first present, multiplied it by the length of the length of the third present, divided it by three.

{"text": "1 mile per gallon\n2. The question asks the rate (the rate at which gasoline is consumed) which we can calculate by dividing the used amount by the total amount. Suppose x miles of fuel is used in total, then x gallons of fuel is consumed (x / 2) at what rate has the gasoline been consumed.\n3. The context of the question is that Bobby takes different routes to get to the supermarket and his farm. Let's assume his average speed to and from the supermarket be's m'. Then after coming back from the supermarket his average speed going to the farm will be s 1+m and going from the farm back home will be s 2+m.\n4. Now we use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time and substitute values, D=(s1+m)(2+m) = (s1+2m)/(1+m) and D=(s2+m)(6-2m)/(1-m)\n5. These two values are added to get 2(s0-m) = 6-2m so s=m/2\n6. Now we calculate the rate at which the gas is consumed by dividing the used (2) gallons by the number of miles traveled. So, 2/ (2x1 +2x 1+ m +2x2+m) = 2/6 = 1\n7. The given question is to find the rate of fuel consumption and the above step gives us the rate, which is 1 mile per gallons of gasoline consumed.

This could be as simple as just signing up to participate in the race or, in some cases, such as with track and field, filling out a large questionnaire to verify certain criteria that you must meet.\nOutput:\n1. The key word here is'verify'. The meaning is simple. Show that you want to run. \n\n2. In order to show that you want something, you need a motivation. Hence, for participating in the race, you may have just signed up, or you were motivated enough to fill out a large questionnaire. In order to participate, you need to comply with certain criteria or parameters that the authorities prescribe.\n\n3. Thus the key word here is 'prescribe'. \n\n4. The question here, is in relation to the race and the word 'prescribe'. The meaning is clear, to participate in the given race, you would have been asked to meet certain criteria. 'Criteria' or in simple words, parameters.\n\n5. In order to meet the parameters, i.e. to run the race, the individual should fulfil the criteria. Criteria could be as simple as someone who has the ability to run the distance or someone who is physically fit, or someone who meets the weight criteria.\n\n6. So, the key words here are Criteria and to run.\n\n7. An analogy here, could be, someone who wants to run a race is like someone who wants to build a house, and thus, in order to run the race, someone would have to register. As you must register, in order to build a house, someone would have to be approved for the permissions.\n\n8.

Find the average size of the profit I will have over the course of a year.\nOutput: First, we need to make the assumption that the loss of $1,205 occurs on a monthly basis.  So the probability of each month is $1,206, divided by $1,201 = 0.97, which is very close to 1; hence, it's a fair assumption to assume a monthly loss.\nWith that assumption, we know that the average size of the loss is $1,210.\n\n\nIn the given statement, the Average size of the loss is 1,210  and  The Average size of the profit is  217,800 = 200,000 + 17800/(0.97)^n\nSo the answer is $217,819.57 which is the average of the average size of the losses and average size of the profit\n\nInput: What is the least the number can be such that 1,531,072 is a multiple of 189,767 but not a multiple of 78,951?\nOutput: 3 (i.e., 3 * 1,532,001 is a multiple of 79,000.\n\nInput: You're playing a game of poker.", "answer": " 750"}

{"text": "1 The given sequence follows a basic mathematical problem where we are asked to analyse Terese's weekly running pattern.\n2. Initially, we should identify the mathematical relations between the given values (4.2, 3.8, 3.6, 4.4) and plot them on a table and calculate the average from there.\n3. We can simplify the problem further by noting that the values (4.2-3.6, 3.8-3.6, and 4.4-3.8) should come out to either 0 or 1.\n4. In short, the problem can be restated as: 'on the first 3 days, the values should be increased from (4.2-4.4), (3.8-4.0) and (3.6-4.2), whereas on Thursday i.e. the fourth day, the value should go all the way to (4.4 - 3.8).'\n5. Now looking at the problem from this perspective, we can clearly see that the average we're looking for is 4.2 which is Terese's first mile.\n6. Thus, the given sequence has the solution: 1.

{"text": "The total number of miles the 2 friends run together is 10. \nSolution: \nInitially we can assume the number of miles both are going to run to be x\nNow in the whole race, if we assume both run a total of x miles and each one of them run x/2 then the whole race can be subdivided into 8 parts and each part will be equal length and will have equal number of people.\nIn 8th part, The 2 friend will be there on the running line. So their running in the whole race will be x/8+x/8=x/4\nNow 8 Miles=x/2-x/4= x/4\nNow 12 Miles=2x/4 which will be equal to remaining part of the running race.

This can be inferred from the fact that she dropped off only 33 flyers despite being on a longer street.\n2. The same can be said of the flyers dropped by Donna who had to use her bicycle.\n3. This suggests that they must have been dropping off flyers along different routes to cover the same number.\n4. Now looking at the given options :33, 66, 67 and 70. The option 33 cannot be right because then Maisie would have dropped more flyers than Donna as opposed to a smaller number.\n5. Similarly, the number 67 which indicates 67 over 2 can't be the correct answer option because Maisie did drop more flyers than Donny as opposed to Maisie dropping lesser flyers.\n6. Now, coming to 66, even 66 over 2 cannot be an appropriate number. The two options cannot include Donna's number which are either equal to 12 or higher than 66 over 3.\n7. Thus, the only numbers which fit this context are 33 and 67 both being multiples of 2.\n8.

After paying an eight hour'rental rate' of $40, Jack and Jill each have $20 left over.\n3. Since we do not know the hourly'rental' rates of Jack and Jill, we solve this equation using substitution and cross multiplication to get $5 and $14 respectively (see detailed answer below).\n4. Jack has spent $5 and Jill has spent $14 on the cottage costing a total of $20.\n5.

{"text": "1. This would not have been a difficult question if only the cellar contained imported wine.\n2. We can assume that we are dealing with two different types of wine viz imported wine and domestic wine,\n3. Let us further assume that a cellar stores wine in bottles of the size of one unit,\n4. This could be a litre, 75 cl or any other unit.\n5. Now there would be 12 bottles in each case,\n6. We must further assume that the number of bottles of domestic wine is 60% less than the imported wine,\n7. It is possible that wine stored is proportional or at 4,166% to imported wine; however this is not necessary.\n8. We can now assume that bottles of imported wine make up 80% of the wine,\n9. As we have one such bottle with 1 unit of space,\n10. We have 1/3 units of space in each bottle,\n11. This amounts to 0.333333\u2026 units of space,\n12.

I was certain that the dog had eaten the  homework. \n\nOutput: 1: We know that \u201cThe dog had eaten the...\u201d is fact.\n2: This implies that the speaker is 100% sure that the homework has been eaten by the dog.\n3: The speaker then says that \u201cI was certain that the dog\u2026\u201d which indicates some level of doubt or uncertainty about the certainty of the fact implied in the previous sentence, \ni.e. that the dog had eatten the homework.\n\nSo, the speaker is expressing doubt about the certainty of their facts. In terms of structure or parts of speech, 'dog' is an animate noun, 'dog had...\u2019 is the base of a predicate, \u2018homework\u2019 is a noun and 'certainty' is an adjective describing \u201cI was\u201d. The sentence has no punctuation besides a period to indicate a complete sentence. We can tell that the original sentence had a question mark because the speaker implies questions within it,  'Is the dog certain of his homework?'\n\nTherefore, the correct option will be 1) The speaker is asking the dog: \u201cIs the dog certain of its/her homework?\u201d, \nwhich is grammatically incorrect.\n\nThus, we can eliminate options 1, 6, 7\n\nThe next option has \u201cthat is true\u201d as a part of the sentence, which does not belong in the sentence as indicated in option 5.\nOption 5 will be the correct answer.\n\nInput: When I first realized that this was my life\u2019s work, it was with a great feeling of sadness.\n\nOutput: The answer is E:sad\n\nAs per the grammar rules the word 'was' should have been used in verb tense \nwhich is not used in the original sentence. \nHence option E is the right choice.\n\n### Instruction: Answer the following grade Science question.\n\nInput:\"The water is contaminated with disease and bacteria,\" said the lab technologist. \n\nOutput:: There is no need to use word 'and', which makes no difference in meaning.", "answer": " 27"}

One was the same length as an apple and the other one was the same length as a potato. If the snakes are an apple, 44 inches, and the other snake is 10 inches, how many inches are in the snakes combined?\n\nOutput: In the given context, the size of'snake' is being referred to as the length.\n\n2. The snakes were there when Penny and Jake walked through the field. This could indicate that the snakes were there to stop them.\n1.

It has been implied that Jake and Penny\u2019s individual snakes were 44 inches and 10 inches respectively.\n3.

She starts at a point in the far left-hand corner of the lawn and completes a diagonal leftward sweep at a pace of 1 square foot per minute for an hour.  Then she turns around, picks up her path, and does the same thing.  This continues until she has mowed diagonally to the far corner.\n\nBut you can\u2019t just plug in a number to the formula.  You have to convert it into a proportional form.  First, you need to determine the proportionality constant, which comes out to 1/(2*(r.h)), where r = 190, and h = 56 (you do the arithmetic, don\u2019t expect them to give you an answer).  (Note that 1/(2*(112)) = 1/(2*(22)) = 1/22, not 1/112.)\n\nNext, use that constant in the original formula to transform it into a standard division problem.  In this case, you can\u2019t write r2/h2, so you need to simplify it to a square root.  This gives you r2 + h2 = r.h.  Now, r.h equals (r + h)(r \u2013 h", "answer": " 210"}

{"text": "1) We want to know how long it would take her to finish every dress she was planning to make.\n2) That would mean dividing the total time that the task would be completed, by the time required to complete each task individually.\n3) Given that each dress would take 4 square meters of cloth and 3 hours to be complete, we simply multiply the time requirement - 3 hours - by the amount of fabric - 4 square meters of material - to get a total of 12 square meters of material for each dress.\n4) So, with 56 square meters to be allocated among however many dresses Melissa had planned to make, it is clear that there wouldn't be enough material to complete every dress she was planning. Melissa would have a shortage of 12 square yards of material for each dress she was planning to finish.\n5) In order to calculate how much time it would take to finish an entire lot of dresses and determine its duration, we need to take out the number of hours it requires to make each dress (3 hours) and multiply it by the number of yards we have to spare (-12 yards for each dress). \n6) Dividing that by the total amount of fabric available (56 square meters) would give an answer of 0.3 hours per dress. A total of 0.3 x 12 = 3.6 hours will be required to finish the entire lot.\n7) Since each dress requires 3 hours to finish and can only be done with 12 extra yards of material available after subtracting the 12 yards from 12 times the total number of materials required (84).\n8) That way, 12/36 =0.333...\n9) 0.333.... = 0.3\n10) So, Melissa needs to work for 0.3 hours for each dress to finish.\nSo, the final answer is C: 3.6\n\nInput: 6.\nOutput: 12. \nSo the final answeris C: 12.", "answer": " 42"}

At first look, the only thing we have to fix in the given sentence is an incorrect punctuation in the first line, so we have to replace a comma with a semicolon.\n2. In the second line, the number \u2018$5000\u2019 does not look right so we have to change the 0 to a \u20185\u2019 in the figure.\n3. We also have to replace the word \u201con\u201d in the second line with a \u2018for\u2019, as the sentence should look like \u201c\u2026for 53,000 miles\u2026\u201d\n4. Now for the solution.\n5. Taking into account the first line, we can calculate that each mile should cost $9.67.\n6. This implies that all the \u2018$X000/53000\u2019 that appear in the second line must be multiplied by $9.67 for every 5300 miles the car traveled.\n7. For example, \u2018$6500/53,00\u2019 must multiply by $9.6 as the car traveled 53,020 miles.\n8. This reduces the amount to $5472.5.\n9. Similarly, the $7500/52600 amount must multiply by $985 as the car covered 526,020 miles leading to a final figure of $53556.\n10.

{"text": "1.The problem in this question is to find how many biscuits can be made with 12*12 feet of dough.\n2.This can be solved by recognizing the fact that area of dough is equal to area of biscuits as they are both squares and each side of the square is equal to each side of the other square.\n3. Now by dividing the length and width of this dough(12*12) with length and width of of the biscuits(3*3), we get the value of sqrt(3). This  sqrt(3) is the area of the biscuit we can extract from the dough.\n4. Thus area of dough=12*12=3*3=sqrt(3)\n5. Now to get the number of biscuits we need to multiply the value(3*3) again with the area(sqrt(3). Since sqrt(3) has been obtained already, the final result(9) has the number of biscups we can extract from the square dough.\n6.Hence the final answer is 9 since we can extract 9 biscuits from given 12*10 dough.\nSo the final ans is given below.\n9\n\nInput: A large pudding can be made to feed up to 30 people depending on the ratio between it and the pudding it is made into.

{"text": "25\n\n### What Is A Planning Algorithm?\nIn computer science, a planning algorithm is a mathematical procedure which can search through the planner's search tree and return an answer - a complete action sequence that solves the problem. Planning algorithms are generally considered non-deterministic.\n\n### What is planning?\nAs such, a planner uses a set of rules that govern the actions in which it has to take in order for its agents to accomplish a given task with the desired performance.\n\n### Goals\nGoals are very important in planning, since a goal specifies what the agent wants to achieve in an environment, and how it expects to do so.\n\n### Operations\nActions may be very simple; for instance, walking, picking up or lying down. Planning is the decision-making process that is required to accomplish tasks.\n\n### Problems\nProblems give rise to operations that a planner tries to execute in order to solve them.\n\n### Search\nIn planning, a search is any activity that can be performed on a set of nodes and operations, in order to find the best solution to a given problem.\n\n### Planning Domain\nA planning domain is the set of all problems that a planner can solve in a given planning model.\n\n### Constraints\nA constraint is a property that constrains the set of plans that a planner can select from.\n\n## Task Decomposition\nIn planning, decomposition involves breaking down of a complex task into a subset of tasks called subtasks, or components.\n\n## Planning Model\nIn general, any representation of the problem that a planner must solve that can be used to determine and represent a solution.\n\n## Goals in Problem Solving\nIn problem solving, goals are targets that one wants to reach. However, goals are often inexact descriptions of an outcome, because in real-world situations one does not know everything and we know that our own models of reality are flawed.\n\n## Search\nSearch is the process of moving from one action to one or more related actions in a finite set of possibilities.\n\n## Uncertainty\nUncertainty is present if each problem has many possible solutions, and some of the possible are not equally probable. \n\n## Operational Decomposition\nDecomposition is the process of breaking down a large, complex", "answer": " 7"}

In which way of grouping up are they most likely to remain warm, which will be the warmest part of the group? Choices:\nA. If the group remains in two lines it will be more efficient to pass their heat from one to another, thus being closer with the heat of the person at the front and of the person at the back, than if the group would form a circle. If two lines are formed, then only 10 people have to huddle with their back to their neighbor thus remaining warm.\nB. If the group instead formed a circle with a diameter length of about 10m, it will be more effective to have 10 people facing each other, than if one would be hugging their neighbor at the back and at the front. Thus forming a circle one needs a diameter length of about only 10m.\nC. If the group instead forms a circle with a diameter of about 10 m. then 10 people are facing their neighbor at the back.

In order to cover his classroom costs for this year, he needs to sell 2000 pencils.  Mr. Baker charges $0.50 to cover his costs.  He makes no profit or loss on the pencils, and therefore any number sold will break even.  Mr. Baker is a teacher, however, so he plans to sell the pencils at $0.30 each to ensure a profit of at least $400.  At this price point, Mr. Baker can only sell the pencils if a number of pencils is sold such that the total dollar value of the sales exceeds his costs by at least $40,000.  How many pencils does Mr. Baker need to sell in order to break even and still make at least $40?\nOutput:  890 Pencils", "answer": " 4"}

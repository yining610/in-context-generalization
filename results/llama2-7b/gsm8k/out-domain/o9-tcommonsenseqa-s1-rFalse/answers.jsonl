{"text": "The question is, \"How much more is Gary spends per month to pay the loans off in 2 years than if he paid it back in 5 years?\". The answer would be 200$, because he spends $6,002/24 months, which is about $258.33, but he needs to pay $3,000/6 months, which is about 500$.\n\nTherefore, Gary spends 200$ more per month to get out of the loan earlier.\n\n### Input(s): The answer is not 200$.  \nHow did you reach your incorrect result?\n\nThe way this task is structured, in the input, I do not understand what \"per month\" means.  I do not know when to start and end the calculation, so I'd like you to help me know when to start and stop.\n\n### Correction:You should account for the fact that the loan will last for 5 years, not 2 years. There is no real \"start date\" in this context, but you can assume that the repayments for the loan will start now and continue to the end of the loan. If we treat $6000 as the total amount of the loan, we can calculate the amount necessary to pay off $6000 in 5 years as:\n\n`$6000 / (12*5) = 6000/60 = $100`\n\nAfter 2 years, the $6000 would be paid in full, and that money would become Gary's property. So now you know that $6000 is paid in full in 2 years. Since the question was looking for how much more you'd pay, you just found out that you would owe $100 for one more year. So now you can calculate for the $2 years remaining:\n\n`$2000/24 = 84.14`\n\nPutting it all together, you simply have to find the difference between those two:\n\n`$84.14 - $100 = -$15.86`\n\n### Inputs:The answer is -$15.\n### Corrections:In your response, you used", "answer": " 150"}

{"text": "If Yasna read a total of 280 pages each day (The number that was the average between the two reading times given), each of her two books should take 2 weeks to finish. So, we have to figure out how long each individual book will take. Since one book took 2x the time, this means that the first book took 2x and the second took 1/2. So, we can say that one book took (2 x 280) / (280 / 2 - 1) = 7 days and the second book took (280 / (2 x 2)) = 14 days. So, to finish the shorter book in 7 days, just multiply by 7 and to finish the second book, just multiply it by 14. Since she has (2 x 2 x 14)/7 = 125 pages left to do, she needs to read 62.5 pages each day to finish both in 2 weeks.\n\nIf Yasna reads a total of 26 pages each day, each of her two books will take only half the amount that we originally expected. Since one book took (2x 26) / (26 / 2 - 0.5) = 14.5 days and the second took (26 / (2 x 1.1)) = 11 days, this tells us that the first book will take 14.5 - (7 - 2) = 5.5 days and the other will take (5.5 - (2 x 11)) = 4 days. If each day we read 13 pages per book, we'll finish 15.5 (5.5 - 2) + 11.5 (4 - 2) =17.5 days.", "answer": " 20"}

{"text": "81%\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe have just covered tasks, inputs and responses. There is another concept that you need to master to be successful in this type of interview. That is: *How to approach tasks*.\n\n### What is meant by \"The approach to the task\"\n\nThe task that you are presented with during this type of interview may be a problem you have never thought about before or maybe something from outside your area of experience. This can be extremely intimidating. So, while you may not know how to *solve* the problem, that's okay, the interviewer doesn't expect you to have that answer. (If they did, this wouldn't be a technical interview; that is why they have you do a written/technical/programming task!) What they have created by presenting you with a difficult problem is a way to check your analytical thinking skills. Analytical thinking is about thinking *through* a problem, breaking it down and answering a series of questions.\n\n\n### The three questions that you should be asking yourself:\n\n#### 1: You are asked \"What do you do?\"\n\nWhat you will probably feel is some trepidation. There isn't just one way to answer this question. The interviewer already knows what you do. They would not have hired you in the first place if you weren't already qualified for the job.\n\nWhat the problem is asking you to do isn't to tell them what your job is. The problem is asking you a question: \"How do you think?\"\n\n#### 2: You are asked \"Why can't you?\"\n\nThis is just like the first question.\n\n#### 3: You are asked: \"How do you get there?\"\n\nWhen asked these three questions, you shouldn't have an answer, they are intended to be unanswered questions. The interviewer is trying to see how you think through problems. If the task is asking you to be logical, that means there are going to be three parts to your solution:\n\n1. You are presented with a problem, in this case a mathematical equation.\n2. Given this set of facts, you must begin to break the problem into it's component pieces, and begin to ask questions that are relevant to solving a problem.\n3. Your answer must then begin to take", "answer": " 24"}

{"text": "How fast does Marcos need to go in miles an hour to make it? In 10 minutes, multiply 5x5=25 miles by 1 to get the distance of the lake he needs to cross. He also needs to cross it in 10 minutes. So in order to complete the task successfully, multiply 10 by 25 to get 250 miles per hour.\n\n### Input  : Marcos has to get across the 5 mile lake in time to get to work, so he can make it on time. How fast must he row the boat to make it. How far can Marcos row the boat in 10 minutes?\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: Marcos should row the boat fast, or else he will not make it. How many mils can Marcos row the 5 mile lake each time he rows across it? To get this, you need to multiply 5 by 10. The answer will be 50 miles, then add 1 time how many miles that is, which equals 51 miles. The answer is 100 miles per hour, or 60 seconds each time Marcos rows the boat. Marcos must do this 5 times. If Marcos rowed 60 times in one second, how many miles did he row? The answer is 1 mile. How far can Marco row the boat? The boat travels at this speed 60 times each second, how many is that? To get this, multiply 5 miles by 60 times 30. The answer is, 900 miles. To accomplish this task, he would need to take the 51 first, and the rest is easy. He just needs to multiply 5 by the number of miles he has to achieve. The answer equals 250.\n\n###Input: A human may need to find his way from home to school. He needs to go to where he needs to go for work. He starts at the home, and it takes him to what?

What was the approximate weight of the baby a week after his birth?\n\n### Answer:\n55 pounds\n\n### How my solution works:Let's just pretend that the baby is weighing 11 pounds at the very beginning of his life. Then, a week later he will be 11 pounds and 12 days old. 12 days is 192.\nSo 3 cans of food is about the 30th or 28th day of a regular 19 year old, which is 152 or 160 pounds. If you just do 27th and multiply it by 35. Then you are left with 27 times 35, which is 915, and 915 divided by 3 is 305, so that would be this boy the week after he was birthed. Then, the 36th day, if it's 15 years old would be 402 pounds. So, the answer would be 607 pounds.", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "To create a variable, we need to type a dollar ($) sign and whatever name you want to give to the variable. We give this variable a value by typing in it equal to something. We can check to see if something was typed into a variable by using the equals sign ($) with a dollar sign($) on both sides(=). We use the equals sign to assign values between values. We can use the dollar sign($) to give the computer a hint that you want it to think like a person. For example:\n\n```\n$cars = 1 $dog = 2 $cat = 3\n```\n\nWe can see the variables from above are $cars, $dog, and $cat. \n\nOur values from the example above are $1 (for $cars), $2 (for $dog), and $3 (for $cat). If we wanted to know how many dogs Candy had, we would type $dog = $2 because it's value is 2, giving Candy 2 dogs\n\nThis is an example of how we can do math equations. We can't use the plus sign (+) because Python will automatically convert it into a space, so we use spaces to replace the plus sign. \n\n```\n5 + (3 * 7)\n```\n\nNow, the 5 is put on the left because it is being multiplied by 3 and 7. The parentheses show that the 3 and 7 are the first numbers that are being added because we want to start with the 5 multiplied by 3. This number will be 15. So, we don't really have to type the 5 multiplied into the next line, but 3 and 7 will be added after the parentheses.\n\nThe 6 will be on the right because it has been added with the right side.\n\nSo, with what we have been taught so far, we can get to our question:\n\n```\nTotalFlour($c = 0)\nwhile ($c < 200):\n    $c += 1\n$bread = 1 $c = 200\nprint ($c)\n```\nWe can type the while statement on one line and it needs to be between the parentheses.

The code needs to read through each student\u2019s grades and return the highest score as a string. This task is similar to the function you wrote for the problem solution test and has a similar array parameter.\n\n### Solution:\n\nIn order to find the highest grade in a grade given from a student by asking them how many grades are they given. This could be done with the help of `array filter` by default `filter` function returns an array of `true` values and `false`. In order to get the highest grade we need to get an array of the grades in an array filter where the returned value will be a `true` value.\n\nNext in order to get the function we first have to get the highest value from the array by passing the `filter` array which is the result of the `grade` given as a value to the grade function. Then we have to convert it to `string` in order to have the highest grade as a string.\n\n### Comment:\nYou don't need to use the filter() because you are using a nested loop to loop through the for loop in order to loop through each element in the grade array to find the highest grade as an array then you have just to convert it into a `string`.\n\n### Question:Input: \n\n### Comment", "answer": " 10"}

Samantha's last name is not exactly half the length of Jamie's full name because Jamie's first name has 3 letters and Samantha's first name has only 2. Bobbie takes two letters off Bobbie\u2019s last to get Bobbie\u2019s name half as long as Jamie\u2019s full last name.\n\nHowever, each name has 5 letters in its last name(Samantha\u2019s is 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 15). Bobbie\u2019s number of letters in last name = 5, which is exactly half of Jamie\u2019s 10 letters in last name. Therefore, Bobbie\u2019s last must have 10 letters and must be 2x long than Samantha\u2019s. The letter Jamie takes off is Bobbie\u2019s, so Bobbie\u2019s first name is 3 letters in length and Samantha\u2019s is only 2 in length.\n\nBobbie = Bobbie with 3 letters in her first name, B+ obbie, and Bobbi with 2 letters = Samantha, S + amantha. Since Jamie has 10 letters in her last name, Bobbi or Sam must have at least 15 letters in last name, so if Bobbie took away 2 letters the remainder of letters in first name gives that 2 + 5 = 7, so 2 - 7 = 5. 2(Sam has) + 2(Samantha has) + 2 letters in Samantha = 15\n\n### Input:(5 x 5 \u00f7 25 \u00f7 (5 x 4 \u00f7 15 \u00f7 3))\n\n### Response:(250 \u00f7 25)(5 \u00f7 4)(3)(15)\n\n### Input:: What is 1103?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Input: The cute boy in pink at the fair, which he would say is the best time to go to one, is the type of what to find at a fair?

Each of the 20 chairs (unused) are each in use by two persons of the remaining x members of the 40-member board.\n\n### We will call the remaining x members, who are not sitting in the 20 remaining chairs a set of people.

Answer 1: I am unsure of what \"plumbing\" means in this task.  I am going to guess that this means pipes for water.  If there are pipes that can not help someone who is thirsty, they are filled. Because if there are no pipes (empty) it can still help someone who is thirtsy. Answer 2: My reasoning is that if the user is thirtsy they need water. and the water can not be in a pipes. because pipes can't help thirsty people.\n\n2. \t\t When a person is starting work, what are they not doing yet? Answer 1. I am looking at this question and am trying to figure out if this answer is 1. working, 2. resting, 3. tired or 4. accomplishing. So far these are what I can think.

He was being told that this country is having trouble with a task, and he was supposed to help him deal with it.\n\n### Jack agreed to do it, and he was very excited about it.

However, in order to travel they need a way to propel the wheels of whatever device they are driving/walking with so that they can get to their desired. To achieve this, they must invest in tires, which could be found at a store such as Sammy's Bikes. It is very likely tires will need to be replaced or repaired quite frequently because of how tires are used in order to travel. Tires will need to be constantly in proper working order so as to be able to safely get from one location to the other via whatever means of transportation.\n\nSo, it is probable a tire would be found at a bicycle station or a wheel shop.\n\n### Request: The tire you have is no good for long motorcycle trips.

{"text": "A total of 19 cookies are left.\n\n#### Explanation:A tray of cookies has 12 cookies, so each tray makes a total of 12 cookies per day. That means each tray makes a grand total of 12(12) = 144 cookies.\n\nFrank bakes two (2) trays of cookies daily, so he bakes a total of 144 cookies each day. But he does not eat all of the cookies he bakes each day. He takes one cookie and eats it. And he eats one every day because he wants to make sure each cookie is good before he distributes them out.\n\nTed comes over on the sixth and final day. Ted eats four cookies. If Frank eats one, and Ted eats four, that leaves 143 total cookies. One of the 143 are left over for the next time Frank bakes cookies. He should make a little less since it isn't the same 50(12) =480 +/- 10 + \\- 5 = 500.\n\n**The final answer is 144 cookies - one for each cookie baked each day, and one for each day Frank eats one himself, in addition to Ted eating 4 cookies. 144 cookies + one for each day Frank bakes, + one for each day Ted eats. And then, if there are any leftover afterward, there are 141 leftover.**\nSo that's 19 leftover cookies at the end of 6 days.\n\n### Input:\"He is an ambitious man.\" Which of the following makes the sense?\n\n### Demostration:C: The man is ambitious.\n\n### Response:\"He is an amitous man.\" He is ambitious man\n\n#### Explanatiopn:Because, \"An ___ man\" (or \"a ___\" man) is defined as \"a man who is successful or highly competent in a particular field\" [1](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/ambitious).

What is an object? 2. How do I know an object? You can read about these questions in the textbook, but before jumping into the textbook,  answer these questions about objects.\n\n2.In class. we have been discussing ideas of what an object is. We also discussed how we know an object. We have defined objects as the things we see. They were not discussed as the things we know. So a better question would be \"How do I know an object?\"\n\n3.In class. we discussed the idea that for something to exist it needs to be perceived by us. The most basic object was a stone. We discussed how we would not see a stone or an apple unless it was perceived by us. We also discussed the idea that objects are things we know (what I know vs. what I see", "answer": " 10"}

{"text": "Bob created 9 questions in the third hour \n\n### Comment: You're on the right track. Your logic, as it stands, is correct and correct enough to solve the problem. However, you are not using the right data structure to make the problem easier or quicker to make the problem solvable. You are instead making it more complicated.  Here are a few places that your problem solving is not correct:\n - You have to change the order of the steps to be more correct.  If you look at the data structure that you have set up.  You go from Bob creating questions (13) and then double the rate from the next time he creates the questions.   You should double the number of questions created each hour. So Bob would create 26 questions in the first hour (26=2*13) and Bob would now be creating 52 questions in the second hour. (52=2*26) So Bob creates 142 questions in 3 hours.\n - Second mistake is to use nested loops/lists on data structure.  When working with a 2D/nested lists/array of arrays or something similar to that.  You always have to account for the first and last item in the first dimension.  So I would always prefer to work from the right -> left (starting at the last point of the first dimension and moving on to the second dimension) instead of working from the left to right (starting at the first point of the first dimension, on to the second dimension).  This makes the code easier to read and make the loop more efficient because you are only iterating through what you need to.  And if you're already looking at that portion you know that it is the first instance in the right dimension so you don't need to read through that index.  (You only have to read through what needs to be read to make the algorithm work.  Not all of it needlessly)\n - You should break up your logic when given problems where you only have to do a set amount of an operation.  For example you should have to only double the rate if you did not double the rate in the previous step.  So you should break where bob created 61 questions in the second time (so bob went from 26 to 49), and then you would make the change to double the rate where bob created 49 more questions (", "answer": " 91"}

He is a hardworking teacher who tries his best to teach his students and make them learn. He also doesn't have many students in his class because he is not quite popular. However, he is doing well in his class because he makes sure that his class is interested in the subject and the class is always motivated to study. So he knows how to have fun while teaching his students. But unfortunately, he is not a native English speaker. In this case, his salary would depend on that as well. He will get $5 for each period.\n\n### Input C: The teacher is a popular teacher because he is able to teach a lot of students. He is also an expert in teaching his subject and can teach it very well. He might teach more than one subject, however, he is also paid more than this as a teacher. On the other hand, if he is not a popular teacher, he will get the salary of a normal teacher. He might be able to teach more periods in his subjects but he cannot do this if his subjects are limited.\n\n### Output:\n\n### Input : $2000\n\n### Response   :", "answer": " 3600"}

{"text": "$16.25\n\n### Detailed Solution:\n\nThe first thing to think about is what type of values are you working with to start. Since Michael has 4 packs and wants to buy 4 more, what are the units of those 4? Are they packs? If so, then it must be that packs have a single value of 2.5. This makes the units of the new crayon we are calculating that Michael will have to be that of packs, as well. The amount of crayons we are figuring that Michael will have is 6. Since the units of both values are packs, the units for those 6 will be 6 packs. Therefore, we have that the value of the packs Michael will have is 15 (6*2.5). The amount of money that will be left over must just be the total of the new packs and the old packs. Therefore, it will be equal to the number of packs he will have after the new purchase and the packs he previously had, so 16.25 (15 + 15).\n\n### Input\n\n### Question:\n*While the child was crying hysterically what was happening in the room?\n\n### Input2:\n*A: the ceiling fan was spinning\n\n### Question3 :\n*A: no sound was coming from the television\n\n### Input4:\n*A: her father was speaking to her with love\n\n### Question5 :\n*C: she was still crying hysterialy\n\n### Input6:\n*D: She didn't feel safe\n\n### Question7:\n*C: She felt safe\n\n### Instructions:\n*Answer the following question.\n\n## Output\n*C\n\n## Detailed Solution\n*As the question stands, it would appear that the choice that is the best answer to give the output: C is 'The ceiling fan was switching'.

This is called variable assignment in Python and is done by setting the variable name to the expression. This can also be done for more complex expressions, such as `z = x+y`.\n\n##### How do you write a while statement?\n> The `while` statement has no semicolon. The indentation is important, for example,\n```python\nprint (\"hello\")\n```\nwill produce the following output\n```\nhello\n```\nOn the other hand, the following will throw an error\n```python\nprint(\"hello\")\n```\n##### How do we determine how many values the variable can store?\n> The variables we make, can store a number or string that has an integer value. The type of the variable must be determined if there are more than one variables or if there are many integers to store at once. The user decides how many the variables can store, however, when storing an object, such as a string, when a variable has already been declared, only a single variable must be used.\n\n##### What does `if \u2026 elif \u2026 else` do?\n> The `if\u2026elif\u2026else` construct can be used to evaluate one or more values and execute a block of statements if the value is found to be certainty or in any one of the values found at any time, else, it can provide more than one, else, a different block of statements.\n> `if\u2026elif\u2026endif` is a construct within `while` and `for` statements.\n\n##### Explain what functions are and what purpose they serve?\n> A function contains a block of statements. It serves as a call of the functions.\n\n##### Where are the blocks of statements?\n> In function definitions and in the code for the variables in", "answer": " 12"}

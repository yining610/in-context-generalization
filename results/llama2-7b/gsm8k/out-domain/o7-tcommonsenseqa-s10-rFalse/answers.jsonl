The formula they use is the distance in feet equal to 0.3 x their height in yards, with the formula rounded up to the nearest distance. For example, a chicken who is 1 foot tall would need to be 0.3 yards away from the fence while a cow who is 9 feet tall would need to be about 2.7 yards away. What is the formula for how far away from the fence an animal should be to follow the formula?\nOutput: \nExplanation: First, find out: the whole chicken is 0.3 * 1 = 0.3 feet.\nFor the round off, we add one to the distance (0.3 + 1 ). Here, it's 1 foot, so the distance should be rounded to 10 feet.\nAnd this is the result of our formula: distance = height x 0.3\nDistance should be about 10 feet from the chicken.\n\nFor the cows, we calculate the distance as follows: (9 - 1) * 0.3 = 6.4, which makes the distance 6 yards and 4 feet.\n\nThis is the distance from the chicken and the cow.", "answer": " 500"}

But what exactly is a README and why do we care how it is written?\n\n### What is a README? \n\nA README is a file that can be placed in any directory that provides instructions or information about what is needed to be done in order to use the files and folders residing within that directory at a later date.  \nWe often see this with command line programs when we navigate to the directory where the program files reside, we see a README file with instructions on how to run the program.  \nWe can also see this in projects that include code because if we navigate to the project directory we usually see a README with instructions on how to use or execute the code within the project.\n\nIt is also important to note that READMEs should be in Markdown form and not HTML.  For example, I am writing this README in Markdown, not HTML.\n\n### What does Markdown support?\n\nMarkdown enables you to include certain formatting in your README by using a set of formatting codes.

For example, consider a class of `Type`, so we can make \n\na: `Type *a;` where a will store an array of `Type` objects, with each object being part of your data. \n\n2) Stack:  This is an array with a structure to deal with the ordering with LIFO (last in first out). If you have a `Stack` where data is accessed using the function `pop()`, where you need the last element that is in your array. The structure behind a `Stack` is to allow FILO( first in last out ). \n\n3) Queue:  This is a similar concept as `Stack`, but it uses LIFO with a FIFO (first in first out) structure. If you have a `Queue` where data is accessed by using the function `peek()`, where you need the first element that is in your queue.", "answer": " 41"}

If all of\n the people born between 12 to midnight were to be in this group the percentage would be 100 %.

This means that the total of even numbers will be even and the total of odd numbers will be odd:\n1 + 3 = 2, which is odd\n1 + 5 = 6, which is even\n1 + 7 = 8, which is even\n\n(C) A set of 12 numbers (111111) + B(888888) + 2(444444) + C(444334) + X(323232) = 202222. As a rule, the difference of two numbers should not be negative or zero and divisors of B, C, X should not divide X. 800 should divide B and 200 should divide X, so B(888...) will be a multiple of 800 and each C(444...) + X(322...) will be a multiple/factor of 200\n\n(C) If I am talking about a pizza with a circumference of 595 cm I will definitely say that it was bigger than a wheel.\n\n(D) The distance from the Earth to the Sun in miles is 929 as you can see, here.

Then you have 1 unit of length is 929 10^2 centimeters and 1 unit of meter is 9 10^3 10^3 cm (since 1 meter is 929*10^2 centimeter).

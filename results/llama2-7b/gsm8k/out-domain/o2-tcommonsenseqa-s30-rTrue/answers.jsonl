{"text": "The question gives us a scenario involving a garden with flowers of three different colors: yellow, purple, and green.\n\nFrom the given information, we can infer the following:\n- Out of the 100 flowers in the garden, 10 are yellow\n- 80% more are purple than the yellow flowers, making a total of 18.\n- There are only 20% as many green as there are yellow and green flowers. This means that 80% of the green flowers are yellow. Now the total number of yellow and green flowers is also 20%.\n- This leaves us with 4 flowers that are not either yellow or green.\n- Therefore, Mark is planting 18 purple and 24 yellow flowers.\n- 25% of the total number of flowers is 5. From the above data, we know that there are only 4 flowers left.

{"text": "This scenario requires us to figure out how much money Tina makes in total for her overtime shifts.\n\n### Solution:   Tina works a total of 50 hours. Tina's hourly wage is $18/hour. According to the overtime rules, her hourly wage plus 1/2 her hourly wage is applied to the overtime hours. The hours 8-10 are the overtime shifts. By applying the overtime rules to the 8-10 hours, we can calculate Tina's total wage: $18 x 2 = $36 (for her regular hours) + $18 x 1/2 = $9 (for her overtime hours).  Thus, her total wage for her overtime shits is $45 or $45.  Since the scenario does not specify how many days, Tina works 50 hours in two day with her regular rate. Therefore, her total wage is $36 x 2 = $72 + $9 = $81\n\n# Math 6", "answer": " 990"}

{"text": "The question involves a system of food consumption where each bird eats 100 beetles in total in a day, each snake is one bird-eater and each jaguar on average is 5 snake-eaters. The question involves determining, given these parameters, the number of beetles eaten by the community as a whole. The key information to solving the problems is that jaguars only eat 5 snakes per jaguar, which is a ratio of 1:5 snake-snakes to bird-birds. It follows that there is 5 snakes per each jaguar that survive to eat a bird the next day. Then consider this: the total number of beetles that jaguars can consume in a day is 5[beetles x jaguars] = 5[5[birds x jaguars]]. This is just (5[5][birds x jaguar])= (5[5])[birds x jaggar]. Since the number of birds eaten by a jaguar is 5[birds x 5], the number of beetle eaten by jaguars can be determined with using this (5[5]) formula.\nIn summary, (5[5]) = 25[birds x (5[birds x   jaguar])], so (5[5])= 25[bird x 25] since the first and second expression of this formula are the same. Therefore total number of beetle consumed by jaguars is 25[bird] = 25 beetles. The total number bietles eaten by jaguar are 25 birds[bird] + 25 birds[25[jag]](jag is the total number of jaguars). This sum is 25[7.5[jaguar]](Since 7.5 is = to 5 * 5), so the total number of beatee consumed in a day is [25(=12)jaguar]\n\n### Test:\n### Demo:\nInput:I need a test, what test would be suitable?\n\n###Response:\nWe would need to identify the person taking the test, and the topic the test is about, and the objective of the test if there", "answer": " 1080"}

{"text": "The answer is $327.\n\n1. If you multiply $13 by 4, you will produce $52. So this means that 4 bags of the Reese's were in Ava's birthdays.\n2. If you multiply $9 by 3, you will produce $27. So 3 bags of the Snickers were in Ava'a birthday.\n3. If you multiply $7 by 5, you will produce $35. So 5 bags of the Skittles were in Ava' a birthday.\n4. We know that $35 + $27 + $13 = $75. This means that each bag of Skittles costs $7. We know that $9 + $5 + $5 = $19. This means that each Snickers treats costs $1.90.\n5. If you multiply $35 by 9, you will produce $729. So this means that multiplying the number of bags of Skittlss by how much each one costs shows us how much the Skittles cost.\n6. If you multiply $27 + $9 by 3, you will produce $141. So this means that each bag of Reese treats costs $41. We know that $75 + $41 = $116. This means that multiplying the $75 by 1.6 to the nearest dollar or rounding it up yields $116. We know that 3 times the price for each bag of Snickers shows us how much the Snickers treats cost.\n7. Therefore $75 + $689 + $41 = the sum: $863. So $863 is the total amount of the Skittles and the Reese's treats. To get the cost of the pi\u00f1ata, we need to subtract the total amount of treats from the cost for the pi\u00f1ata alone: $13 - $863 = $-850.\n8. Subtracting is the same as taking away, so you can write this as: $(-850). Finally, we do the same for the cost for the treats: $13 + $863 - $850 = $327", "answer": " 99"}

In this case, the answer is -2.\n\nIf we were to take the square root of a negative two, we would get an irrational number. However, the question only asks for a \"negative square root\".

The question asks what time is it and which of the following could be the reply. We can see that all the options are the reply that could be the actual reply, except we chose the last one.\n2. We chose 16:24, because the man, according to the question, wants the time 1 (one) second (less than 60 seconds) before 16:20. He does not need to add one to 16:21 because he can still have 05 or 00 in the minute.\n  2. He also does not want to say 16:30+1 because then he will say 16:40 and 16:39 and he gets confused between them.\n3. We chose 1 second before 16:50 because if he had to say 16 seconds before 16:31 it cannot be possible. Because 16:32 is already half past 16 and in this case 32 would be added to 16 which will be 48 and not 16:54 and then 16:55 will be a half past hour and not 1600. Also not 16:48.\n  2.

How many cars will most likely pass you before you are able to restart your car?\n\n### Dem: The question gives us a situation where a car has stalled on a busy highway during rush hour. Since the car must be turned off and restarted, it cannot be left. As a result, the driver must wait for traffic to clear.\n\n### Solution: Since there are six lanes in this highway, with multiple cars in each lane, there is only going to be so much time that a single car will be able to wait for. We can start by eliminating answer options with large numbers of cars per time period because they are unlikely in a high traffic area and may not ever occur. The remaining answer options have a wide range of options that may not be able to be fit into six lane road because of the heavy traffic flow.\n\n### Rationale: \n1. The options must be between 5-20 minutes. \n2. The options must be less than or equal to the amount of time a car is parked in the first lane on the highway, as the car may not be able to move on to another lane for any reason.\n\n### Answer: 15 minutes.", "answer": " 9"}
{"text": "720 ft\n\n### Demostration:\n- The long sides are three times the short sides. Therefore, 3\u00d7X=640. Since the long sides are three times as long as the short side, the short piece should be replaced, and if it is replaced it should be 1/3 of it's original size. Therefore 1/3 of 640=216. 640-216=424. Four times two hundred and four equals seven hundred and twenty. 720=640-204. 640 was subtracted by 1/3 the short side. Therefore 3/3 of the short side is the amount required to be replaced. (X=3/3=1). 640=640-(3/3) and 640-640=0 (This is because there is no 3/3 length, only 1 because the 3/3 are equal. So subtracting them leaves you with 0). There's no 3/3. Therefore 640-1=639. 639 divided by 3 is 213, and 213 multiplied by three is 640. This means the short side needs to be replaced with 213 ft of fence. This is 720 ft.\n\n- The chain link is rusting. There is no other choice. The 640 can only be attained by replacing the 213 ft.\n\n- Since X=1, there is one side that needs to be replaced. 1/3 of the replaced side(X) is 720ft. This means only one side needs to be replaced, because 720 is more than 1/3. There are three sides, which leaves two unchanged. Since, 720 is the amount of total fence that needs to be replaced, 720/2=360. 360-360=0 and 720-360 is 360. Therefore we have 360 ft of fence that are unchanged. 360*2=720.

Let's consider the first part of the question, which tells us Jim has a total of 301 models.\n2. We can then determine the number of Fords by using the information given in the statement that \"Jim has 4 times as much as Ford's as Buicks\" and the statement that Jim has 3 more than twice as many Fords as Chevys.\n3. With this information, it is fairly simple to determine that Jim has 165 Fords.\n4. For the second part of the question, we must therefore determine the number of Buicks.\n  - If we know the number of Fords and we know the number of Chevys, we can subtract the number of Chevrys from the number of Ford to determine those number of Buicks. Hence:\n    - Buicks = number of Fords - number of Chevys \n    - This will give us a value for the number of Buicks, which will be 136.\n\n5. There are many ways to solve such questions.

{"text": "The Skipper started from a location marked by his GPS device as being 50 km away to a location measured by GPS that was 20 km away. He then sailed his ship to a second location measured by his GPS system, which was 30 km away. The journey from the first location to the second location took 20 hours (30 km/hr * 20 hours = 600 km) of travel.\n\nThe Skipper decided to turn on his engines at the second location, but while his engines were on, a storm blew his vessel a little north. The storm lasted for 18 hours, meaning that for 18 hours the speed of his vessel was not affected, or did not change.  Therefore, the first 20 hours after the Skipper decided to turn his engines on are irrelevant for the storm, because the wind will blow the ship to the west regardless of whether the engines are on. In the 18 hours after the engine was turned on, they were already blown a little north, so the first 20 h and last 4h of the 18 hours will not affect travel, therefore 10 hours is the 1/3 of total travel. Thus the Skipper was only 10 hours from where he started. We are asked about how far West he was blown.\n\nTo calculate how many kilometers, we know that during the 18 hours the vessel was blown a little North and we will determine the distance traveled to the West. The Skipper traveled 10 hours and 20 km west.\n\n#### Rationale:\nAfter the last 10 hours (30x2x10h)=600km, the Skipper turned on his engines and decided to go directly to the destination, traveling at 30 km/h at this point. The first 18 hours had no influence on where he finally ended up. The Skipper was only 3km from his destination after 18 hours. Since 3/30 = 0.1, and so 0.1km would be blown to the West during the 18 hour period. The Skipper was blown 20kms to the West.", "answer": " 200"}

Instructors will be encouraged to provide clarification about the context as part of their prompts, so that all students can respond with correct answers and avoid point deductions for not attending.\n\n### Experiment:\nWe also learned that students had difficulties with certain question types, mostly involving arithmetic. To that end, we are revising the arithmetic questions, for example, by adding context that gives students more information to use and by explicitly stating the units of measurement. We will also develop new types of exercises for our students and continue to revamp the math prompts.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n> 1. We will continue to improve how we deliver writing assignments and the assessments associated with them.\n\n> 2. We'll improve our methods for providing ongoing feedback, and we will continue to explore new ways to support students in all programs.\n\n> 3. We will work with faculty so that they have the right tools and resources in place to support online learners\n\n### Key Takeaways:\n\n> 4.

{"text": "80 people\n\n### Logic: \n\nThis question can be answered two different ways.\nThe first method we use in the response is to use the distributive property (a*b = ab) to find out how many people a certain side of the family invited to the wedding.\nIf the bride and groom invited 20 coupls from their side of the tree, then together they invited 80 + 80 total couples. This means we can use the distributive property once again to determine how many people the friends invited to the wedding: 80+80 + 180 =240 \nTherefore we can conclude that the guests would equal 240 / 3 = 80.\nIf we take the other approach, we simply multiply the 2 numbers given, 180 + 100 = 280. Since there were 180 people in the original group and 100 were wedding guests (including the couple), we subtract 100 from 280 and we get 180.\nThis represents the number of friends who attended the wedding.\n\n### Proof:\n  We multiply 180 by 20 because 20 times anything is that many more.2\n  We multiple 100 by 1 because 1 times 1 is itself.\n  We subtract 20 times 100 because since we are adding in couples, 1 time 100 is going to bring us back to our original 180, therefore we are 180 from this point.\n  Since we subtracted and got 180 and we already started with 180 we already have everyone there!\n  This means we have 180 guests to our wedding.\n\n\n### Difficulty:Easy\n\n### Sources:", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "The correct answer is D: 7 miles\n\n### Reasoning:According to the statement, Roger biked 2 miles this morning and 5 times that amount at night.\n\n### So, we need to multiply the two times together to get the total that Roger biked for.\n\n### In order to do so, we use 2 times 5 since it says that Roger has biked 5 times that amount that he did this morning.\n\n### Our answer is 7 miles, because 2 times 5 equals 10 and 10 times 2 equals 20 miles, so 5 times 2 equals 10 then 10 times 10 equals 100.\n\n### 100 miles equals 7 (round up) miles because there are 2010 miles in 100 miles rounding up to the nearest whole number.\n\n### Thus, the correct answer is D: Roger rode his bike for a total of 7 miles.\n\n### Response 2: (Option E)\n### Roger rode his bike (2 miles) this morning and 5 more times (5x)  than that amount, (he still rode his bike everyday)  How many miles did he bike every day?\n\n###  So, Roger biked (2+5x)  which equals 9. (since 5 times 2 is 10 and 2 is added to 10 makes it 12, so we round down, 12 is 10+2, we need to round the amount of 2 down so you add the 2 times again, 14 because there is 2x2 and that comes out to 4, so 10+4 is 14)\n\n### Then, (4 times 100) is (400)\n\n### We then round up 400 to 401\n\n### 401 + 2 (because 4 is added, so 4+1 is 5) = 402\n\n### Adding both, 402 and 401 gives (803)\n\n### So 803 + 2 is (805)\n\n##", "answer": " 12"}

Therefore, the total weight of the metal bar and the weights, all together, is  2 pounds.\n\nSince this is not yet sufficient information to answer the question, it is important to consider the following details:\n\n* Weights are identified by their color (blue or green).\n* There is only one type per color (i.e., for blue, there are no \"two-pound\" or \"three-pound\" weights, as there is a separate category for each).\n* Weights do not change or alter their weight as they are added to the bar.\nDue to the information above, the following can be said with certainty:\n\n* A yellow weight must weigh the same as the metal bar it is placed upon.\n* A yellow weight is never blue, green, or the metal bar.\n* A yellow and blue weight cannot be placed together on the bar; this combination is not possible.\n\nThis information is sufficient to construct a valid answer, as it allows us to use a table in order to find the total amount of weight of Harry's custom created weight bar.\n\nHere is how we will go about doing so:\n\nStep 1: Find the sum of each category of weight.\n\nThe number of weights of each category is listed in bold for ease of identification.\n\n| Green | 2 | 4 |\n| :---: | - | --- |\n| Blue | 1 | 0 |\n| Metal bar | 0 | 1 |\n\nStep 2: Total each category of weight. \n\nThe total for the green weights is equal to 3 pounds, not 4 pounds as given. 4 is the sum of a green weight (1) and a green weight(2) plus the metal bar (1).

How much did he earn?\n\nResponse: If we wanted to compute the number of toy helicopers and toy car, for example 15 toy helicopter and 10 toy car, the answer we are going to get is $700.\nSince Bert is able to sell 15 toy car and the price for every toy car is $40, so Bert is able to earn $15 x 40 = $600 \nSince Bert is able earn $600 but not only, for the toy helicopeter Bert's also able to sale for $50 x 15 = $750, the total of toy helicopter is 15 toy hicopter where the total is $50 x 20 = 1000. The total that Bert earn in that selling is $750 plus $50 x 5 toy helicopter  = $1050, the toy car is 10 toy hicopter, and the price for example for the toy car is $600, so the Bert can sale $600 x 10  = $6000.

The result would either be negative, or it would be Friday. Since the 17th would be a weekend, we can conclude that there is one week until the 17th is a weekend. The answer to this question, then, is C: one week.\n\n### Follow up:\n### Demostraion:\nTo solve this, our first step is to apply substitution. This is because we are only given information about the amount of time required to get a pizza. Substitution can be applied with the statement: How many hours did it take to get the pizza? To find the answer, we can multiply the pizza by.355. This is because there were.355 pizzas required to be purchased for a full pizza.\nThe answer is A:.355\n\n### Demosatration:\nOnce again, substitution is the way to go. This is because we know the information on the number of days it will take to get to the weekend, but we do not know the time of the day. So, substitution can be applied by stating: How many hours until lunch? To find the answer for this, we can multiply 2 days with.25 by 2.

There are 12 cups of kible in the bag.\n\nII. Mary feeds 1 cup of kible in the morning and 2 cups in the evening.\n\nIII. Frank feeds 1 cup in the afternoon and 2 cups of in the late night. The problem states that the new bag has 12 cups, so there are (12-2) cups left. Since Mary and Frank both added at least 1 cup each time with the amount they gave Luna, each cup of new amount will contain a kible less than the old one. Therefore, (12 - 2) kibles were left, there is an assumption.\n\nThen since Frank gave even more than Mary, Frank gave (2-(12-2)) cup kibles less than Luna's previous portion, so the amount that Luna received before was (12-2)+2-(2-(12-4))\n\nSince the amount Mary gave to Luna has not been added in the calculations, 1 cup was added on the (12-2)-4. Since Luna received an extra cup in the morning, the amount taken was (12-(1-(12-2)+4)\n\nThe rest is simple manipulation of the numbers. (16-8)=8, now we can add (12+2)-8=4 more and the conclusion is 12. There were (12-2)=10 cups of kible.

How should I keep my wound clean? Choices: A: Use a towel and apply antiseptic B: Apply antiseptic regularly C: Use soap and water D: Wash thoroughly E: Disinfect\nRationales:2. The question tells us that the doctor told the patient to keep his wound clean.  This suggests that cleaning it properly is an important, necessary, or fundamental aspect of healing.\n4. As such, the wording of the question is important. We are not asked to \"keep the incision clean\", or \"keep my cut clean\", but \"keep the incision on my wound clean\", which indicates that wound care is an inherent or interconnected part of incision or cut care.\n4. We begin by noting that cleaning the incision involves \"keeping the incision on my ______ clean\".  This suggests that the incision is on our body, and the body part is in or on our ______. Because it should be on our body, we know that the body part needs to be ______. For the body part to be in or on our ____, it must first be an ____.  Therefore the right answer is E: disinfect.\n5. The remaining options include phrases such as \"regularly\" or \"everyday\", neither of which make sense in the context of the question. The doctor instructs the patient to \"keep the incidence on my wound clean\".  Therefore, regularly is unlikely to be the case, as the incision should be clean only when it is necessary, so it is disinfected only occasionally or rarely.\n6.

The answer must contain the number of days in March, so we eliminate options A and B \"the number of months you'v been alive\" and \"the number of minutes in a year\" because neither contains the number of days in this month.\n\n2. A times two must contain the number of months times two, an example would be 2x5 which has the same value as 2*(5-1).\nWe should, therefore, look for options with two and a number in them. These options are C \"the number of minutes\" and D \"the number of times I say hey\" so we can eliminate options A and C \"the a number of months you' ve been alive\" and \"The number of minutes in a month\" because they don't contain two.\n\n3. We now look to see if the number of days in and out contains the number of days and two because if it doesn't it can't be a part of the answer.\nAgain we look at these two options D \"the number of minutes I say hello\" and E \"the number of times you see an I say hello\" to find out whetheir they contain the number of days and the number of times they say hello (and can be a part of the answere) because both contain those two items.\n\n4.

{"text": "**RATIONALE:** We need to set up a simple algebraic equation to solve for the total mass of fruit in the orchard. First, we determine that there are a total of 70 apple trees and 45 peaches trees. Next, we figure out the mass of fruit that is produced by each apple tree and peach tree. Each apple tree yields 150 kg, meaning that each produces a mass of 150 kg. Similarly, each peach tree yields 65 kg per tree and so each has a mass of 65 kg. The last step we need to do is add up the mass of the mass of fruit produced by all trees of each type.\n\nThe orchard's fruit can be modeled as a function of the number of apples and peaches trees.\n\nF = 70(150) + 45(65) = 15,650 kg\n\nTherefore, the answer is 15,600 kg.\n\nAnswer: 15,660 kg\n\n### Demaration:\n**RATIONAL:** This response is missing several key pieces of information including the fact that apples produce greater than 150 kg while peaches produce greater than 65 kg.

{"text": "$$ 0.5* 1000(50/100\\ )$$$\n$$= 0.5*(1000\\times 1/2)$$$\n$$= $500$$\n\nRationale: I used basic multiplication to find the correct answer.\n\nThe question was asking about the amount of money the man would have to pay to get all the bricks. I figured that if you could purchase 50% of the bricks for $0.50 per brick, you could just go buy those and make a partial shed. However, you could only use 50% of those bricks because of the amount of \"discount\" you had for being able to buy half off of the bricks you wanted to buy. By subtracting 50% from the cost of the bricks, you are effectively taking a 50% reduction in the price. To find how much money the man would have left to buy the other half, you would figure out the amount he would have to spend on those bricks. Therefore you would have to multiply 1000 (how many bricks he would need for the non \"discounted\" price) by 1.5 (which is how much the price would be raised to get the true price of the bricks). When he figures out what the \"real\" cost by those discounted bricks should be, he could use subtract the $0.50 bricks from the $1 bricks to learn how much he would have to spend.\n\nThe main concept is how you figure out the \"true\" cost of the brick.

Which day of the week can she go to bed earlier, so she can get to school on time? Choices: \nA: Tuesday B: Friday C: Thursday D: Wednesday E: no early morning for Betty\nRationales:1. The purpose of this activity is to help a person go to bed earlier.\n2. We eliminate options B Friday and E no early morning for Betty. Fridays are generally one of the earliest bedtimes, so Friday would be unrealistic choice for this activity. The question does not mention that Betty wants to sleep for longer and her activity does not require this. Furthermore, the term early morning does not refer to the length of time. We also eliminate option E no early morning for Bety because there is no mention of bed time length in the question either.\n3. We next consider option A Tuesday. This is a great candidate, however it does not follow the rationale; we need a day that would allow Betty to sleep longer, and Tuesday does not fit this criteria.\n4. Next, we consider option C Thursday. This choice fits the rationale perfectly. Thursday is the latest bedtime, with the question implying that Betty is looking for an earlier bedtime.

Since we are dealing with salt, which is a solid, and water, which is a liquid, we can equate one liquid volume to one solid volume using the idea of a mole or an Avogadro number. Thus, 1 gram of water = 1 mole of H2O.\nTherefore, the salt concentration is 400mg/400ml, 400mL/g, or 400g/mL.\n\nNext, we need to express 400g as a whole.\n\nSo we know `x = 2000 * 500 = 1000000 g`\n\nBut `10000 = 200  * 500`\n\nNow, we can remove the zeroes and get `x = 400`.", "answer": " 400"}

The question asks what I personally think about this type of question.\n2. This gives me a sense of ownership over the answer. It is my opinion and thus more authentic than other choices.\n3. A \"lot\" could be any quantity, it could even be more than the number of options. C \"none\" and D \"many things\" could be a suitable option as well, which makes the question vague and too general.

The question asks for the total number of pets owned by Ed, given that we know the number of dogs, cats, and fish.\n\n2. To solve this problem, we organize the information: we know that Ed has twice as many fish as both dogs and cats combined.\n\n3. This tells us that Ed has at least an equal amount of fish as pets overall.\n\n4. Since the total number of animals is an odd number, this means that the number of dogs must be an even number.\n\n5. So if Ed has, for instance, two dogs, a total of six fish are present, two more than the number of cats (four).\n\n6. Thus, even though the precise total is 3+2, we know that the odd number is greater than or equal to the even number.\n\n7.

{"text": "Choices: A: 8 B: 7 C: 1 D: 9 E: 4\n\n### Rationales: 1) In order to solve a scenario with this amount of information, one should begin by listing out all of the possible scenarios when considering four possibilities. In order to do so, one can start by adding a scenario to the list as long as the sum of all scenarios is 40, which will not exceed 4 people per seat.\n\n2. For example, the scenario {1, 1, 1} will suffice because the total number will be 40 and it will contain only 1 person per seat.\n\n3. After considering this possibility, however, one must consider the scenario {1,1,2}. As with the first scenario, these 3 people can be assigned to 2 seats each and it will total to 4, so this scenario can also be added to the scenario list.\n\n4. For scenario {2, 2} we have already accounted for the scenarios {1,1} and {2,2} on the first two lines of the scenario list, so it is no longer necessary.\n\n5. After considering all scenarios from the first three lines, we will have scenario {3, 2}. Since this scenario has a total of 8, it will not fit on the table of 2 by 2. In order to accommodate scenario {4,0}, one can add space for it by shifting some items to the left. So we move 1(1) to the left so that only row1 can accommodate seats\n\n6. For now, there are 40 items in the scenario list, which is a little more than 4.\n\n7. One would notice the same scenario {1,2} appeared twice in the previous list. For each scenario that appears multiple times, there would be two scenarios that accounted for the extra people. So for this case, the scenario {2, 0} and {0,2} accounted for the extra two people, which we do not need to list because we've listed scenario {4,0} in the previous list.\n\n8. At this point, the scenario total is 48. The extra people would be two because it started off with 40 and we have 8, which is 48-40=8.", "answer": " 48"}

Richard cleans his room in 20 minutes and Cory cleans her room in 25 minutes. Blake cleans his room in less than Cory.\n2. Richard finishes his room in 2 hours and takes off his jacket to put on a tracksuit. The 40 minutes Cory spends on every minute of room cleaning and 4 hours she spends cleaning her room. Blake takes off his shirt and puts on his gym shoes to clean his room after finishing his room in the same way. Blake takes 10 minutes off his jacket to make it a tracksuit.\n3. Richard finishes his tasks in 52 minutes, Cory's first 10 minutes and her second 40 minutes to a tracksuit. Blake has taken off his jacket and put on his gym shoelaces and is cleaning his room.

The question asks how many meals the bike messenger needs to deliver. (this implies the quantity that needs to be delivered).\n 2. Consider option A \"8 times 27\" which is obviously false. Since the first number refers to the amount of meals, and the second number refers to the amount that the bike messenger must deliver, 8 times 27 does not make sense.\n 3. \"13\" is another inapplicable choice as 8 times 13 does not make any sense, and is not a valid representation.\n 4. \"11\" is only a number and does not make any logical sense.\n5. We can see that \"293\" is another impossible choice because 8 times 37 does not equate to 293.\n6. There will not be an answer of \"375\" to this question. 8 times 45 could possibly amount to 375, but it is still not valid, so we can eliminate this option.\n7.

If the sack is removed so that only the stones remain, the weight of the stones is now 80kg. What is the weight of the sack?\n\n### Demostration:\nThe first step to solving this example question is to figure out how much the sack weighs. Since the sack weighing 50kg is now placed next to the remaining stones, the answer will depend on the combined weight of the stones. The combined weight of the stones would be 80kg since this was the weight remaining when the sack was taken away.\n\nThe sack weighs 50kg, which means the combined weight of the sack and the remaining stones is 130kg.

{"text": "11\n\n### Demostration:\nRationales:1. The age of Mel can be calculated using the formula 2X + (2-3) = 11. This calculation involves using the fact that Katherine is 24 years old, that Mel is 2 years younger than Katherine, and then subtracting 3 years from the two numbers to get the expected result of 11 years.\n2. Alternative solutions could be to compute 2(24)-3 or 30-5=25, then substract the remainder of 11, which is 25-11, which is an equal result of 14.\n3. A wrong solution would be to compute 3X + (2-2) = 27, as this solution does not utilize the actual ages of both Katherine and Mel, instead re-calculating 24 to be 3X + 1.\n4. An alternative incorrect solution would be to compute the number of years that Katherine is older than Mel, since 1X = 12, which is Katherine's age.\n5.

Choices: !: The streetcar A: The streetcar stop B: The streetcar C: The trash can D: The traffic light E: The curb\nRationales: From the question it is evident that the five symbols represent the traffic situation as the five cars approach the streetcorner.\n\nSince the question asks which of the five symbols we need \"to describe our situation\", we have to consider what our situation is, and then determine what symbol best represents our situation.\n\nLooking at the five symbols, we see that a stoplight, a traffic light, and a curb are all concrete objects that serve as physical barriers for the traffic.

The question suggests how many chairs are in a hall with 32 tables, and we'd like to know the answer.\n2. We could divide the tables and see how many have 2 and then how many have 3 or 4 chairs.\n3. But the question is missing an important detail: which tables have 2 chains and which have 3 and 4 seats?\n4. The answer seems obvious, since half the tables have two seats, and half of those have four seats. But how do we know how many tables in total have two chairs per table?\n5. This is where eliminations are helpful. Eliminate the wrong options and the correct one becomes clear.\n6. Hence we consider 2 chairs (C), 3 chairs (D) and 4 chairs (E). We then see only a chair (C) has 2 chairs.\n7. Likewise, 3 chairs (A) and 4 chains (E) also have 2 chairs total. This makes it clear that the hall has 41 chairs total, half of which have four chairs per table. We know this because half of the tables are two-chair tables, so how many tables in total do have 2 tables? (2 / 2 means both, hence there are 2 /2 or 2 tables with exactly 2 seats.)\n8. It is then obvious that the answer must be D, because 50%(2) = 5/10 (5 tables)\n9. There are 32 tables, so there must be 8 tables that each have 4 seats, adding up to 41. D is correct.", "answer": " 91"}

Since the book takes Serena 20 days to finish and Emery can read 5 times faster than Serena, then how many days does she take to finish the book?\nSince Emery can finish the book in how many more days, then we subtract x by 5, which equals 5 days and then 15 days since Emery can read 10 times faster than Serena.

{"text": "The average of the weight plates was 6 pounds heavier on the lower portion.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The key piece of information given by the question is that the weights are heavier when being lowered.\n2. This indicates that the weights must be heavier than their base weights before the machine even begins to adjust.\n3. When the machine uses its special technology to further increase the weight, it means the weights are already greater than their base weights.\n4. We subtract the base 30 pound weight to calculate the increase.\n5. The question then asks us to calculate how heavy the weights feel when they lower. To find this answer, we subtract 30 pounds from the total weight.\n6. We then multiply this answer by 10, as this is the number of weights used.\n7. Since the weights were 20% heaviest while lowering, we then divide this result by 10 to make it 20%. We add 20% to the total weight to find the new total.\n8. This result shows that the total weight on the lowered portion of the lift would be 1680 pounds, or 20% heaviER.\n9. Therefore, the answer to this exercise and problem is that the weights feel 20% heavieR. This is the weight that the exercise machine displays on the computer when you are lowering the weight.\n10. The word \"heavier\" is not used to mean that objects feel weightier, but it refers to a heavier amount of weight than what was already being lifted.\nAnswer: A: 200 pounds\n\n### Instructions:You should use all 7 numbers to answer each math problem below.

{"text": "The number of cans Lucille would need to paint her room is 5. This is because there are a total of 14 square meters of surface area in the room, so each can of paint covers half of this, or 7 square meters.

Write a response that provides an appropriate response.\n### Instruction\uff1a The person was told that the can covers 50 sq ft. How many cans does that person then need to completely cover the flooring in the room?\n\n### Demostration:\n1. The question gives a scenario where a person is given a piece of information and is asked to figure out how many cans of spray paint are needed to complete a task.\n2. We can assume that the person in question is already planning to spray paint the room, which implies that he or she is aware of the volume of paint and the amount of surface area to cover.\n3. The question then asks for information on how many spray cans are needed, which indicates that the person must already know the answer.\n4. From this, we can eliminate options A \"8\" and C \"6\" because the person already knows that answer, so it would be redundant to provide it again.\n5. Therefore, option B \"5\" is the only logical answer, because it is precisely half the total area.\n6. The rationale behind this answer is that a single can only covers a quarter of a floor, so to cover the room completely, the person needs 2 cans. However, the question then asks for information about the cans needed in total, so the answer should only have a numerator of \"4\" to satisfy this requirement.\n### Instructon:The following scenario describes how things look at the moment.

It takes 1 ticket for a total of $2.50 to be added up for each scout, and the scouts have a total of 10 scouts.

How many elementary school children live with both their parents?\n\nRationales:\n\n1. The instruction tells us that there is a specific percentage of children who either live with both parents, or they live with only one parent for one reason or the other.\n\n2. We should find the percentage of children who both live with both parents, and subtract that from the total population in order to get a percentage of children in this category, which is what the instruction instructs us to find.\n\n3. We begin by grouping and rewording the information presented in the question, then rewriting it in our wording.\n\n4. We note that there are 40% of children who live with a parent who works abroad, which could be either one parent or the other.\n5. Similarly there are a total of 17% of children who live in single, or one parent household.\n6. This reduces the population that does not live with both parents to 83%.\n\n7. We need to find what percentage of the 83% of children living with both parents; which is the question that was asked.\n8. This means we must subtract the percentage that live with one parent abroad/at home from the total 83%, leaving us with 25%.\n\nAnswer:\n\n60% - 40% = 20%\n\n20% - 27% = 3%\n\n3 % X 100 =.3%\n\n\nInput: An example of an object that is two dimensional is: A) a graph B) a table C) a map D) a graph\n\n### Instructions:\nFind the best response as determined by rationale to the question above.

Here, 2 is another factor of 18.\n18 is a divisor of 18, so we can skip over that number.

The plane can take maximum weight 5 bags  each having weight of 50 pounds.\n\n6600 pounds total weight limit for 6 passengers\n\nThe plane cannot hold additional bags, because the luggage limit is exceeded.\n\n### Rationale\n\nSolving an optimization problem:\n\nThe problem asks how many bags the airplane can take if all bags are at maximum weight, and weighed 50 pounds each.\n\nTo answer the question how many bags, the airplane can take,  we must determine which is greater:\n\n5 (50)*6000 = 30,000 pounds\n\nOr,\n\n6000 * 5 =30,00 pound\n\n5000 * 6 = 30, 000 pounds\nWe have found the answer by using the properties of logarithms, 300 = 5 log 10, then 80 = 6 log 10, so if we add 30 on the left side, and then do the same procedure on the right side. We get 300 + 30 = 330, and 80+30 = 110.  When these two values are compared we will see that the logarithm of 600 is closer to the logarithm of base 10 than the number is to the number of 300,  so the right side of the equation is dominant.

{"text": ">**Step 1. Prepare**\n\n```\nThis task is asking us to find the average distance that Terese runs on each day, and the answer is in the 6th line\n```\n\n```\nThe total distance she runs is 14 miles. Then the average distance Terese ran on each day can be calculated as follows:\n\nMonday: 4.2 miles = 4.2/4.2 \nTuesday: 3.8 miles = 3.8/4.2  (3.8/3.8=1.08, rounding to two significant digit)\nWednesday: 3.6 miles = 3.6/4.2 (3.6/3.6=1.04, rounding to two)\nThursday: 4.4 miles = 4.4/4.2  ```\n\n```\nHowever, according to this formula, the total distance runs by Tuesday and Friday are different.\n```\n\nTherefore,\n```\nWe can notice that the average distance Terese is running on Monday through Thursday is 3.9,\ntherefore the average distance Terese run on Friday is 3.9 + 4.4/13 = 3.98\n```\n\n### Question:How far does Terese run during the week?\n\n### Demostration:\n\n```\nWe can obtain the distances Terese run on Friday by following this formula\n```\n\n```C:R+1=d(d+1),\n\nd:   distance Terese run;\n\nR:   round integer (16=rounded by Terese);\n\nC:   remaining distance after rounding, i=round(3.98)\n```\n\n#### Distance\n\n```R:16    16+1=17     3.98+1=4.01\n\nC:3     3+1=4     4+1=5\n```\n\n```4.01-3=1\n  5-3=2```\n\n```4+2=6```\n\n```6.01-3.98=.03,\n\n.03*16=.48```", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "Write one or two sentences and use 3 to 4 complete sentences. Please respond to each line. Responding fully to each line is the most helpful to the tutor since we have to understand exactly what you do and what you should do.\n\n### Rationale: How do I respond to each line?\n1. Please write one or two sentences about the question\n2. We eliminate options A and B because they do not pertain to the question.\n3. We then consider options C and D, which both have the same information, to see which one of them is more applicable to the question.\n4. We choose option D because it states that Mack wrote 60 pages on Monday and Tuesday, whereas option C only allows us to do a calculation for the total amount of pages that Mack wrote on Tuesday.\n5. Then, we find the difference between D and C to find how many pages Mack writes on Monday and Tuesdays.\n6. Finally we calculate the total amount of pages Mack writes from Monday to Wednesdays by subtracting the number that we found from Monday and Tuesday from the total amount of pages written by Mack.\nAnother option could be to directly compute the total number of pages written by Mack, such as using one minute to equal 60 pages, and then multiplying Monday's, Tuesday's, and Wednesday's 60 minutes by that. However, this is a computation method that requires more time and effort, and therefore is inefficient in answering this question, compared to a simple calculation like what was shown in the above rationale.\nAnswer: 120 pages\n\nOutput: You have chosen to work on the following question:On Monday, Mack wrote in his journal for 30 minutes at the rate of 1 page per 60 minutes.

The question gives information about how old Jessica is now, and what age Claire will be in two years.\n2. However, it does not explicitly describe what age Claire will have reached in two years, or what the resulting difference in their ages will be.\n3. Therefore, the question is missing the necessary clue that will let us determine what Jessica's age right now is. This information can be easily inferred, however, and is essential because it provides a basis for determining Jessica's age now.\n4. We can calculate the age difference between Jessica and Claire, and then use a simple math operation to find Jessica's age based on this value.\n5. We can also deduce that Jessica must be at least as old as Claire by the way the question is phrased.\n6. Finally there is a common age rule known by almost everyone about older people.\n7. In summary, the most reliable and straightforward conclusion that can be drawn from the question is that Jessica is 6 years older than Claire by now.\n8.

A: Trout B: Bass C: Both D: Neither\nRationales:\n\nThe scenario doesn't specify whether Bucky had tried catching a trout before, so we cannot assume he gave up after a failed attempt.\n\n1. We eliminate option A because a trout might only be worth as much as a bass (since the scenario does not state how much of each Bucky has caught), and since Bucky only has 5 trouts and 5 basses left to fish up, they are equally valuable, if not more valuable than the other.\n2. We also eliminate option D - \"Both\" - because in this scenario, the best possible outcome would be if Bucky had more of one than the other, not if he had equal numbers.\n3. Option B \"Bass\" could be chosen if Bucky caught more basses than trouts and is hoping to catch even more. However, this outcome isn't necessarily the best possible.\n4. We are left with option C \"Neither\", which states the outcome as neither fish is more valuable than the other, hence the second best possible outcome, which will always be the case when a person has the same number of each.\n5.

Twenty years later, it tripled again and doubled again to 3x 500 people, and it will do it four more times. How large is the town's population now?\n\n### Demostration:\nWe can see that the population doubles every 10 years. So, in 10 years, it will have doubled its initial popluation.\nThe population doubles again every 10 years, so after another 10 years, the population will double again, which totals to 20 years, which is the population doubling it to 500.\n\nIt was given that the population it will do it four times again. It does it 4 times because the town's population doubles every 12 years.\n\nSo, 20 years after, the population triples again, and it doubles again to 500, double 1 more time, then doubles again to 1000, double 2 more times, and then doubles to 4000, for a total of seven doubles to get to a total of 4000 people\n\n### Response\nGiven the population of the city doubles every 12 yars and triples every 12 years, the answer in 100 yrs will triple to 2x (3^20)^2. 2x means 3^20^2 will increase by another 3^20.

{"text": "5 seconds: Let x = the seconds it takes the border collie to chase after the ball. According to the information given in the problem statement, it takes 8 seconds for a ball to fall (or fly) for 8 seconds. This means that the ball falls for 8/60 units of seconds or 0.13333\u2026 seconds per second. Also, Belinda can throw the ball with a speed of 2 feet/second. This means that the speed with which the ball flies is 2 for 0.13 seconds or 0.26 feet/second. Now, when the dog starts to chase after the flying ball, he chases for 5 feet/second. The final speed at which the dog is running with respect to the ball is 5 feet/second \u2013 2 feet/second = 3 feet/second. Now let us consider x = the seconds it will take the dog to catch up with the ball. Since we know that x is equal to 5 and based on the information provided, it must be 5/3 feet/second.

So based on this information, we begin solving the above problem statement.\n\nWe begin the same way we did in the last exercise. We use the formula \u201cspeed = distance travelled divided by the time taken\u201d to solve the above problem.\n\nThe question wants the time in seconds. This tells us that the speed of the process we wish to determine must be in feet/second. This tells us that we need the information, which the container\u2019s diameter we\u2019re given is 420, in feet to use the formula.\n\nTime will only work here if speed will work. In reality, water is not filling the container at a constant rate; instead, it fills the container with a varying speed.\n\nWe substitute the information in the formula.

If the city's population increases by 4% more per year than the population of the state in which it is located, how many people will the city have in 5 years?\n\n### Demostration:\nInput: Given a scenario where we are asked to determine the number of people living in a city after a certain period of time. The question refers to a specific set of percentages, which indicates that the city's population must increase each year by a certain amount percentage. Additionally, it states that the city's current population is 2,85 million. These facts give us relevant information for the calculations.\n### Solution:\nTo determine the population in 5 years, it is first necessary to calculate and multiply the population in the 4th year by the percent percentage.\n(Population in the 4th + % % + the population in the 2nd = 4.05 + 0.04 + 2.72 = 6.81) The solution to the problem can be calculated based on the fact that the city's future target is to increase the population by 4.75 per cent each year, which means that in 5 years the population would increase by approximately 25%.\nAssuming that the current population is 2850000, applying our calculation, we can reach the conclusion that the population in 5 yrs 25% would be 3575000 people.\nThe answer to our problem is 3575,000.\n\n### Input", "answer": " 20"}

Hence, it will take a total of '1 hour' to clean the house.\n\nTrey then wants to take a shower. If everything on Treys To Do list takes 5 Minutes to complete, Trey would spend 4x 5 Minutes or 20 minutes on taking a shower. \n\nFinally, Trey wants to eat dinner. There are '4 things to do to have dinner' and if everything on Treys To Dos list for eating dinner takes 10 Minute to do, then it would take 40 Minutes to get all of Treys meals prepared and cooked which would take a total of '40 Minutes' to cook Dinner.\n\nAt this point Trey has 1 hour for cleaning the house, 40 minutes for having dinner and Trey is done 'cleaning the house' and still wants to have dinner. Trey has to make sure he will have enough time to shower and clean the house before eating dinner.\n\nFor the shower, Trey washed for 20 minutes and the next is the 3 hours.

We use the given information and apply the formula. \n\nSince $4$ $pounds$ of hamburger per $4$ family members then there will be$ 28lbs of hamburger$ \nWe also have a quantity of $18$ $lbs of hamburgers$ remaining. Therefore, we divide this quantity by $28$ to get $6725$ $ounces$.\nEach family member will consume $16.87$ $ounces$ per $person$.  The $8$ $person$ will consume $135$ $ounces$ collectively.\nSince the recipe calls for $16.89$ $ounces$ or $1/8$ of a pound. Subtract this $16.8$ $ounces$ from the answer which gives us $(133 - 16.8)~ounces$ per $family$ member. Therefore, $each$ family member will consume $81.3$ $ounces$\n\n### Rationales:\n1. In part one, one must find the total number of family members including the person making the meatballs: eight. The first question in part two needs a calculator because there is no reasonable way of determining the answer to this question given the information presented: 0.01687 ounces is not reasonable, because when you write a number in scientific notation, such as this, you are supposed to have ten (10) significant figures.

Now let's split 35:50 by 2 and 50:35 by 5, here you have two cases, one is when state quarter is 50%. So when they are 50% or below, we will get that 2/5 of it is state quarter. And then we can split it by 5 of them, and then divide 6 into 2, which means 100/2. But for 150/2 we will just divide 3 into it and you will get 5/15. But when they are more than 50%, we will get that 1/2 is state quarter, and then we will split it by 5, so we divide 60 into 2, which is 30/2.

By breaking down the sentence, we can understand what kind of concept a spade and a spade is. Our English dictionary will provide the meaning of the word'spade'. However, as per the context of the sentence itself, the dictionary is not going to be helpful. Thus, we take a completely different tack by looking at the sentence. 'Let us' is a short and simple phrase and means let us, or should we let us. 'Call' is a verb. The phrase after the verb is 'a spade a spade'. If let's call 'a spade a stake', then what's the meaning of 'a spade a Stake' as per the context of that phrase? The answer would be obvious - 'a spade a Spade'.\n\nTherefore, 'a spade a SPade', if you break it down, means 'let us call a spade spade.\n\nRationale #2: We can interpret the sentence in another way.

{"text": "180\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The first step we need to take in this situation is to identify the total cost of the 12 tickets. We know the price of each ticket is $40 and there are 12 total tickets because Mr. Benson bought a total of 12 tickets, which would be 12 times $40. Thus, we can say that total cost of the 2 tickets is $e5 $12 is.\n2. We then need to figure out how much the discount is for every ticket bought that's above 10. This means we need to subtract $0.50 from $40 every time there is more than 1 ticket.\n3. Therefore, if 1 ticket is bought, the cost total is $40, and the discount is then $0.00. If 4 tickets are are bought, the cost total will be $60, and the discout is then $0.50.\n4. Similarly, if 8 tickets are bought, the cost then $70, or the discount is then minus $0.75.\n5. If 12 tickets are then bought, the cost then is $80 and the discout is $0.50, and so on and so forth.\n6. We also know that the discount is applied to tickets that go beyond 10 since the discount is $0.5 for every 10 tickets. For example, if there are 20 tickets, then the discount is then applied to 10 tickets, because the first 10 tickets were $40, the next 10 tickets are $50, and then the last 10 tickets would be $60.\n7. So, we know that we won't add any more dollar signs after the $80.\n8. Therefore, the answer would be $180.\n \nAnswer: $180\n\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58000790/122516659-a0d2c600-d99b-11eb-9045-1d5fc51e1b", "answer": " 476"}

The formula for mean is \"Population Size\" divided by \"Sum of Population +1\". Since Lima isn't being discussed as a possible choice to take the survey, we will move on.\n\nLet's discuss option 2: Dayton, Ohio\n\nAs we can see, the city has an income of $85,300 and the population in the other cities was higher than that of Dayton's.

{"text": "#### Rationale 1:The word \"considering\" in the question can be translated to English as \"so, in the case that one is not aware\" or \"there shall be no other guest\", and \"in how many\" means \"considering the floor\". \n\n#### Rationale2:Since there is no other person to consider, the total rooms are 10 on each floor and the hotel total is 100 rooms. However, since Hans is staying on the first floor, we should exclude the last floor. Therefore, in how many non-last floors could Hans be checked-in (first floor being non-last floors and second-floor being last floors)? \n\n#### Rational2: Since the second floor is the last floor, it should be regarded as other floors. Therefore, the answer should be 99 + 10/(100-2) which equals 98.\n\n#### Rational3: Since it is not the first floor, all the other floors should be counted as non-last floor. \n\n###Input:John lost his car keys.\n\n###Response:\nHans lost his car keys. \n\n## Input:You may have noticed that I'm using a lot of words that you don't know.\n\nInput:You may have noticed the use of words that you don\u2019t know, by using a lot of words.\n\n###Demonstration:\n\n###Rationales:\n\n1.

This sentence suggests that there is more than just two or four.\n3. We can see this from the context, that John has used more complex words than just two or four throughout the conversation.\n4. This leads us to the conclusion that he has used a lot of words that he may have. We are not sure about how many, so it is not possible to provide an accurate answer.\n5.

{"text": "Henry spent a total of $124.24\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe only number used is $5.50. The problem states:\n\n> how much he spent on the pills\n\nTherefore x is the amount spent in total on the pils. This is because we already know the answer. If we multiply the amount x by $5.50 we obtain $5.50 x x, and since x represents the total spent on the pills we are calculating, this is Henry's total bill.\n\nTo calculate what x is, we can break the number of $5.50 pills into how many we used daily to achieve $4.90 times 14.\n\nHenry has 490 pills (49 x 14). So, multiply $9 x 490. Thus $4510, then divide by 5.50 because we want x: 4510 \u00f7 5.50 = $817\n\nNow that we have our x (817 pills), multiply $9 x 817 = $7504.\n\nAdd both 4510 and 7504 together.

He has 8 gallons of gas in his tank. He travels an extra 200 miles on his 1-way trip.\n\n### Option:A: He needs 16 gallons of gas to make a 900-mile round trip.\n\n## Demonstration:Rationale: The question describes a total distance of 400 miles for Mr. Montero'a trip.

If he has 8 gallons, then he has only 2/3 a full tank.\n\nThen, the question says Mr. Montero has already traveled a trip of 200 miles, which means he has already consumed 200/20 gallons.\n\nSo to travel 601 miles, he just needs to add 400/3 = 133/3 = 44 gallons, which leaves him with no gas in his tank and he needs 8 gallons to get back to his destination.

{"text": "The fifth scroll is 4560 years old.\n\n### Rationale:\n\n1. The information given is that each scroll is older than its predecessor by half as many years.\n\n2. This means that one scroll is 4000 years old, the next is 3540 years old, the third is 3040 years old, and so on.\n\n3. The information on the fifth scroll is that it is 408 years older than the first. This means that the fifth scroll is 4848 years old, i.e., 4080 + 3540 + 2840 + 1840 + 940 = 14440 years old.\nNote: The answer is in 1440 years. 1000 is half as many years as 2000, i.e., the first scroll is 4,000 years old. Therefore, 1,440 is half as many as 2,880, i.e. 4,848 years old.\n\n4. We now take into account the condition that each scroll is older by half the age of its predecessor.\n\n5. This means that the fourth scroll is 4040 years old. The fifth scroll, therefore, is 456 years older than the fourth scroll. 456 is half as many years older as 912 years, or 912 \u2013 456 = 456. Thus, the fifth scroll is 912 years old (or 812 + 456 =1268 + 456).\n\n6. Subtracting 912 years from 2000 gives us 1088 or 80 years short of 1168 years.\n\n7. We can also express 456 as (4 x (4 + 1)) + 1 which simplifies to 20 + 5 = 25. Thus, the fifth and final scroll must be 26 years older than its preceding scroll, or 1268 + (25) = 1293 years old.\n\n8.

{"text": "The question is what amount of money would be left after Jake spent half of what he has, got a 25% discount on a concert ticket, and also lost half of what he still had.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. Given the scenario, the question is to determine what money would be left after a certain transaction has occurred.\n2. We can eliminate options that do not mention spending a certain amount of money.\n3. Option A is to \"take a trip to the beach\". To \"take a trip to\" would mean to go to a store and buy a ticket (admission) for the trip. The question does not involve a trip to a specific spot, but rather a trip to the beach, which describes travel to a certain spot.\n4. Option C is the only one that has a \"to go\" in it, which leads us to believe this option is a valid answer. It could be the result of a calculation if we were asked what it would cost to buy a concert ticket on top of what was left.\n5. Option D mentions buying a concert ticket, which could be the result of us taking the final amount, and then adding it to buy the concert ticket, and then subtracting the cost of the concert ticket.\n6. Option E is not completely in line with what we know about the situation, it does not state that half of what would be left is spent on the concert ticket, but instead leaves this open to interpretation.\n7. Furthermore, option E is a \"who\" question, where we are asked about who would be left after the transaction occurs.\n8. Therefore, the answer must be C: $2,850.

The word \"thinking\" in the first sentence hints that Jeremy might have alternative ways to get rid of his useless stuff besides throwing it out or throwing it away.\n2. It further is revealed that Jeremy made a conscious decision to donate it instead of making other choices.\n3. This means that Jeremy does not find donation to be more burdensome in any way compared to other alternatives such as throwing it out or throwing away.\n4. The question itself states that Jeremy is also not driven by the option D \"they need it\" because the question is phrased with the pronoun \"think\" instead of \"he thinks\". This suggests that Jeremy does not donate his stuff for other people to use.\n5. Thus, the only answer choice that fits this context is C \"the donation will be tax-deductible\".

Thus, we can get 1 hour past noon, which would be 12 PM.\nWith the time in hours past noon being 12, 6 hours would be 60.\nSince every 6 hours the shadow would grow 5 feet, at 60 hours, it grows 5 feet.\n\nHence, the question is how long the shadows from the buildings will be after 2PM.\nTo do this, we take the time after 2PM and subtract one from it.

{"text": "Cary's main goal is to design an irrigation system that meets the requirements of the farmers. Based on the scenario, he needs to consider the amount of water each farmer's land takes up and how much each farmer's crops require to be irrigated.\n\n### Option A: Incorrect\nThe question asks for the percentage of water used, so we need to calculate this value. We are given information on the acres of each farmer and the amount of water each type of crop requires. We also know that the total amount of water used is 340 gallons. To calculate the percentage, we can rearrange the formula % = (n / total) * 100%, where n is the number of acres of each crop each farmer grows.\n\nFor Farmer Bob, we calculate n = 20 gallons/1 acre * 3 acres = 60 gallons. For Farmer Brenda, we calculate n =80 gallons/1  acre * 6 acres = 480 gallons. For farmer Bernie, we calculate n =20 gallons/acre * 2 acres = 40 gallons. Thus, when we subtract the water used by each farmer from the total, we have:\nSubtracting what we already know (the total gallons used is 34 gallons), we get -340% - 340 = 77 - 370 = -297 gallons.

I went into a store and found a gallon glass milk jug that I can buy at the grocery store. That could hold a lot. But, I do not have enough money. I thought about a box with 3 gallons on each side. I decided on that, because the box has only 6 sides. Can you help me determine how many gallons of milk I could get per dollar in this arrangement? \n\nRationales:\n1. The question asks which structure can hold the most milk, given the cost of buying such an object.\n2. The first choice is that it is a gallon glass milk jar. This could indeed hold a lot of milk, suggesting this may be the optimal choice.\n3. Though the box with 3 gallon sides could also fulfill the requirement, it requires 6 sides, which is more than the original jar. The milk jar could also hold more than the box since the jar is not solid, or \"closed\u201d, like a box is.\n4. The jar also costs less to buy than the same amount of milk in a box, indicating that the jar is a better value for money, while the box requires more to buy.\n5. The box only contains 6 gallon total on its sides, while the jar can hold 2 gallons.\n6. This would mean that the jar could potentially hold more gallons of milk, since the jar can contain up to two gallons, while the box can contain six total.\n7.

{"text": "475\n\n### Rationale 1: If you double your production on the second day then on the 4th day you should increase in the same manner as before. The first day you start with only 50 and double it for 1 extra day and add 20 eggs. So 50 + 50 +10 or 100, because you doubled your production. The 4th day you will have to double 10 + 20 or 30, so 10 + 40, which gives us the total of 400. This is just the 4th day total. So by multiplying 100 by 4 we get 400 = 400. Then add the total from the 3rd day which was 20 eggs which equals 100, so we get 40 + 100 or 140. Finally, we add the 4th day output of eggs which was 400 =440. so the final answer is 440 + 140 or 580, which is 475.\n\n### Rational 2: On the second, third, and the fourth day you double the day's total amount. We can see this in the text by applying the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th day total equations as follows: 1st day 50 = 2nd day 50 + 2 = 3rd day 50 +2 + 2 = 4th day 50 +4.

This sentence provides us with the total amount of money that Chad receives, which we know to be 600.00.\n2. The next sentence (the third line) provides the specific breakdown in regards to mowing yards. We know from this sentence (the $600) that the total money that Chad earns (receives) in a year is about 4x greater than the amount he receives from doing odd jobs, and 15x greater than the amount of birthday/holiday money he receives.\n3. According to the third sentence, Chad earns the most from doing yards. The amount is specified as $250. The next sentence (about the video games) states that Chad earns the second most from selling video games. Hence, it is true to say that Chad receives the greater amount of money from doing odd jobs, than he does from selling video games, but that is not the greatest amount that he receives overall.\n4. The last sentence gives us the total amount that Chad earns or receives in a year. This amount is specified as $700, which shows that what he had initially received (from mowing, etc.) amounted to about $300 (40%), and that what he got from selling video games amounted to about another $50. The remainder was the birthday money.\n5. Using what we have learned in # 1 through # 4, we calculate the money that Chad saves.\n6. According to #1, he receives $700 total.\n7.

The correct answer is 50 matchstick squares because the dimensions in the question are all stated in square units or square feet.\n3. [option a] There are 40 matchstick squares in the question, each square is a 1-by-1-ft square. This means there are already 40 square units to work with as building blocks, meaning there is no need to cut up the square further.\n4. [option b] Since each matchstick square is a 1 sq ft by 1 sq ft square, the length of the matchstick will be 1 ft. Therefore, each square matchstick will be equal square matchsticks at 1 foot for each square on both length and width.\n5. If we multiply 30 by 1 ft by 1 ft, and if we multiply the house used by 10 matchsticker squares, the product will be 3000 sq ft or 3000 ft^2. This value is indeed equal to 50 square squares.\n6.

Then, we subtract 72 from 76, which gives us 4, so the home team scored 4 points.\n\n### Solution2:\nLet\u2019s look at this another way.\nFirst, let 36 be the opposing team score, then, 36 + x = 76, where x is the home team score.\n36 + x = y, here y is 40 (4*10).\n36(2) = x(1) then x = 18 (1 * 18)\ntherefore we obtain x = 18.\nnow we can write 0 - 36 = x (since the opposite team total score is subtracted to the home team total score)\nx = 4.\n\n### Answer: The home team did not score any points, which equates to x = 0.\n\n### Input:\"The temperature in Atlanta, Georgia is about 81 degrees, is that hot?\"\n\n### Demostration :\nThe average air temperature in Atlanta, Georgia, during the summer is 81.4 degrees Fahrenheit. A degree Fahrenheit is equal to 5 degrees Celsius.\n81.4 degrees Celsius = 5 * 81.4 = 406.2 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe average air temperature is 40 degrees Celsius.

{"text": "There are 6 sides plus 4 sides plus 2 sides. Total is 12 side\n\n### Demostration:\nRational: In the instructions below, I explain and request that you respond.\n1. The sentence gives a situation where a woman, Emery, is searching through a drawer in her house.\n2. We know this because the sentence mentions that she is looking for cookies and there are several cookie cutters.\n3. We also know that Emery is looking for cookie cutters that she could use for making cookies from the phrasing of the sentence: \"where her mom keeps the cookie-cutter\".\n4. This implies that Emery could not find the needed cookie cutters in the drawer itself, which would be absurd and the topic of another sentence.\n5. Hence, we know that looking is actually searching.\n6. The sentence then provides a list of shapes of cookie cutters Emery finds in the drawer. These are 6 triangles, 4 squares, and 2 hexagones.\n7. We know these are the shapes as the shapes were given in the list.\n8. There are 6 sides for each triangle because it is a polygon, which is a shape with multiple sides, and each side is counted as a side. \n\nFor reference, a triangle is commonly known as a three-sided shape.\n\n9. Similarly, a square is a two-dimensional geometric shape with four sides so it has 4 sides. \n\nA square also has equal 90-degree angles.\n\n10. We also know that a hexagon is a six-sided shape. There are 6 hexagons, giving a total of 6 sides, because of this definition for hexagons.\n\nFor reference, hexagons are also commonly known as the six-sided shape where each point has 3 lines connecting it to other points.\n\n11. Putting this information together, we see that there are a total of 12 sides since there are 3 sides each for triangles, squares, and hexagons.\n12. 7 sides are triangles and squares and 5 sides are hexagons, adding up to a total of 11 sides.\n13.

Because GWI mentioned a \u201cyou (not me) might\u201d indicate she was making an inquiriry.\n2. The question was asked using the third person perspective, therefore, GWI was not asking how she felt but how the other person felt. \n3. The rationale is when someone ask what a group or a class would do if the situation is provided, then it is not a rhetorical or a yes / no questions but, a question that invite suggestions from a group or a class.", "answer": " 1660"}

A: pie charts B: bar graphs C: bar graphs and pie charts D: statistics E: neither of those\n\nRationales:\n1. One of the four different ways used to display the data is bar graphs - used to show categorical variables. The bar graph displays data on a horizontal bar graph - where individual values fall on the scale as well as category values that have been grouped. \n2. The second type of data presentation is pie charts - which is used to show measures of central tendency - frequency distribution. A pie chart is a circle cut into different sized sectors which represent percentages as shown on the chart. \n3. The other two methods used to display data are bar graphs and bar graphs. \n4.

The question implies that Angie bought 3 times as many as Shelly, but also that Angie bought less than Barry. These two statements are not compatible, so either the question is incorrect or it is missing something.\n> 2. The question then says that Shelly bought \u00bd as many as Barry, but we are already told that Barry bought more than either Angie or Shelly. This second statement is also not compatible.\n> 3.

If it's an emergency, the dietitian needs to get it before the next 35 minutes because otherwise the situation is no longer an emergency anymore. For which of the following time periods is the answer \"before the next 35 mins\", correct?  A: before the next 42 mins B: after the previous 45 mins C: before the next 52 mins D: after the previous 58 mins\nRationales:\n1. The situation is considered an emergency until the next 35 minute interval \nafter which the situation becomes no longer an emergency.\n2. If we consider time intervals as intervals with equal length, then the situation is still an emergency for **41m** after which it would be no longer an emergency (for **42m**).\n\n3. If we consider this situation as a series of consecutive non-overlapping time intervals with equal size, then the situation would still not be an emergency for **53m**.\n4.

The Sun stays at this angle all year long. \nThe Sun usually moves southward from December to March.

{"text": "Pandas tend to not have children outside of their own biological habitat.\n\n### Explanation:\nGiven the premise that pandas (in this case symbolized by the number 16) have a tendency to mate with other pandas within their own population, we can reasonably deduce that if a pair of pandas are not able to conceive after mating, the likelihood of that same pair conceiving a child with another pair of pandas is significantly low, due to the same fact that these two pairs of pandas are from different biological habits. One would then expect that if a pair of the number 16 pandas was able to conceive after their first mating, there is only a low chance of that same pair conceive again, but if the first pair was not able to conceive, then the chance of conceiving again is even lower, for all new pairs.\n\n\n### Response :  According to the question, the probability of a couple conceiving is 25%. Since there are 16 pairs, then only 4 or those pairs will conceive.\n\n### Rationale :\nThe question gives us a scenario involving a zoo with 16 pandas paired into mated couples, where only a quarter of the pairs (which is the same as a quarter of 16 or 4 pandas) conceiving, and each couple having one child after they conceive.\n\nSince there are 16 pandas, we have to multiply the 25% by 16 to see how many pandas will have children.

{"text": "There will be 128 ants in the jar after five hours.\n\n### Comments:\n\n* The instruction asks how many ants will be left after 5 hours, or how many ants there are every 5 hours in the jar\n* There is a general formula to find the ants after n hours. We can use n instead of hours for this purpose.\n* We need to find half of 50, that is, (1/2) * 50 = 25. Since each hour doubles the number of ants, every two hours would make the number go up by 1, every four hours by 2 and so on.\n* Hence, after five hours, it would go up by 5, and after ten hours it will go up by 10. This adds up to 25, meaning the total ants after five hours are 25 + (10/2), which is 26.\n* Therefore the total ants five hours after leaving the jar of 50 will be 26.\n\n### Rationale\n\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1wZJM4rB6Uw5i6sZC4-14XbMi57rS8DQo7jYgHdKgRjw/edit\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following grade 6 math question.\n\n* A student asks a teacher how many digits there are in Pi.\n* The teacher tells the student there are 127 digits in Pi.\n* Does the teacher correctly tell the student how many Digits in Pi?\n\n### Demand:No\n\n*The answer is no because Pi is a circular function, so its area is infinite, not 127.

{"text": "James spent a total of $158.  He made two $110 separate purchases and bought 2 rounds of drinks for 5 people. He spent $66 on food. His total cost for the night was $158.\n\n### Rationales:\n1. There are two ways to attack this question. We can approach this from an algebraic standpoint and multiply each part individually at first. This will simplify the steps we take as we solve for the total amount spent.\n\nAlgebraic solution #1:\n(110+66) *2 + 6(5)\n\n110, 66, 110, 200,10.20. It is important to note that the total of any row or column should be $158. The first row is $110*2 $220, which is too much. We subtract $20 to make the answer $200 and now move on to the next row. This row is $66*5 $330. It is too large so we subtract $30 to make the answer 300. The final row is $118*2 $236. It subtracted 22 so we divide 3 by 4 to give us 0.75. Multiply by the number of friends $20.  We found that he spent $150.75 with 5 friends each spending an average of $20. That would mean each person spent $194.50 overall.\n\nSolution #2:\n1. James bought 5 rounds of cocktails. Since he purchased it with two rounds, we can multiply $102.80 by $2, which gives us 205.60\n2. As James bought 6 beers, the beer costs $14. Therefore, his total amount is 14*6= $84.00\n3. Since James bought 5 chicken dinners, we can multiply $84.0, which gives us 420\n4. James spends $150.50 and leaves a 30 cent tip for $5.

A: share a post B: search for the photo you want C: use the \"add a photo\" button D: do a search for Facebook E: use the \"new photo\" button F: post a memory\nRationales:1. The question asks what to do to put a photo on facebook.\n2. Here, we need to select our choice from 6 options.\n3. It is obvious that a user may want to upload a photo to his/her Facebook account, but does not know how to do it.\n4. Therefore, options A \"share a post\", B \"search for the photo you want\", C \"use the \"add a photo\"\" button\", D \"do a search for Facebook\", can be potential choices and match this case.\n5. Option E \"use the \"new photo\" \"Button is not applicable here because it means to upload a brand new photo to FB, and \"uploading a photo\" is already mentioned \"add a photo\".\n6. Therefore, A \"share a post\" and B \"search for the photos you want\" can be applied.\n7. Option F means to share a story using an uploaded photo, but this is not the target task.\n8. We eliminate B \"search for the \"photo you want\" then, since it is the same as A \"share a post\".\n9. Only one option can be selected from these. We compare option A \"share a post\",\"C \"use the \"add  a photo\" button\",D \"do a search for fb, and F is the \"upload\"  photo button.\n10. Now we need to make a comparison between A \"share a post \" and \"do a search for facebook.\n11.

{"text": "The correct answer is C.\n### Determination:\n\n#### Solution 1:\n\n1. Number of buildings which fell in the first three earthquakes = 4 buildings.\n\n2. In the first earthquake, there is no further collapse.\n\n3. In the second of the three earthquakes, there is two collapses.\n\n4. In the earthquake there is six collapses. (2+4=6)\n\n5. In the last of the three earthquake there is eight collapses. (5+3=8)\n  [Note: We can assume that there wouldn't be more collapses in the second earthquake because the reason for the fall of these four buildings is that it is in such a unstable condition in the first earthquake]\n\n6. The total number of buildings collapses in all the three earthquakes = (4+4+6+8)= 20 buildings.\n\n7. Since the first earthquake caused 4 buildings collapsing, the total number of buildings collapsed in the whole phenomenon is 24 buildings.\n\n[Example 1:](https://imgur.com/4ZOxjA6)\n\n#### Solution 2:\n\n1. In the first earth quake, there are 4 buildings that collapse.\n2. The reason they collapse is because the phenomenon is unstable at this point. They are left unstable.\n3. At the end of the third earthquake, there are a total of 6 buildings that collapse because of the unstable foundations.\n4. In the first three earthquake there was a total of 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 buildings that collapsed (assuming that they all collapse in just those three earthquakes).

{"text": "The answer is 864 square feet. \n\n### Answer: 864\n\n### Rationales\n1. To answer this question, we must correctly measure the dimensions of the rectangles that Ann cut from the bolt. \n2. The living room has 4 feet by 6 feet and the bedroom has 2 feet by 4 feet. That means that the bolt includes 8 feet by 12 inches. \n\n3. When multiplying an area as we did, we need to multiply the length by the width of the area. If an area has a 8 feet by 4 feet, then it has a total area of 32 square feet. We then multiply that amount times 16 feet to get the area of the bolt in 512 square feet.

{"text": "Answer: 25 \n\n### Rationale: \nWe can use a bar chart to graph the problem. We can see the number of coins at each hour. Each bar in the chart shows the number of coins collected in an hour. Every time a coin is collected by Joanne, one additional bar appears in the chart. After 15 coins were collected in the fist hour (15 = 15), a new bar appeared on the x-axis.

The question states that three fourths of the beans are red, but that one fourth of the red beans are coconuts.\n2. The task is to work through the problem and reach the answer.\n3. According to the task, the only thing we can take away from the question and the problem is that three fourths of all beans are red.\n4. We are then given that of these red beans, one fourth are coconuts. \n5. The given information is enough to solve the problem.\n6. Given the choices, we can then eliminate answer options B and C.\n7. Option A implies that we don't know how many beans total, which we do know, so this is eliminated.\n8. Option D implies that we don' want to keep track of the total number of beans in the jar. \n9. Therefore, the answer has to be E.\n\n### Rationale\n\n1. The only information given is \"There are some jellybeans in a jar. Three of the beans are coconit flavored. There are 750 coconut flavored beans\".\n2. The student had to reason that in order to make this equation work 3/(4*750) = x. Given a question like this, 4*(750) can never equal x. So one of the choices must be right and they eliminated 4*(75) = x. The other choice of 4*(75 + 0) = x is untrue, so it is eliminated. \n3. So the answer should be 3*(4*(750)) = x and the equation is solved and gives you x = 240. \n\n\n\n### Input\nI needed a shoe to go for a walk, but what shoes do I go for?\n\nB, because bunnies wear bunny slippers\n\nBecause I just love rabbits and the fluffiness of their fur.\n\nEeeEeEEE (hysterical sound of laughter)\n\n\n# Input\nThe question for the math less", "answer": " 4000"}

We see that there are different numbers of students in each class, and the cupcaking requirements are not identical either.\n3. We can infer from the question that Jessa is planning to make cupcakes that will satisfy each class's requirements regardless of the class sizes.\n4.

{"text": "The total number of meows is 95. \n\nRationales:\n\nOne cat meows three times in one minute (3 times per minute) for five minutes, which equals ninety times in five minutes. The second cat meows twice as frequently as the \nfirst cat. To figure out how many times the second cat will meow in one minute, we need to figure out how much time it takes for the second cat to meow ninety times in five \nminutes. One minute is equal to 60 seconds. We divide ninety by 60 to find out how many seconds it takes the second cat to mew ninety times in five\nminutes. Ninety divided by sixty is 1.5 seconds. Therefore, it takes the second cat fifteen seconds to meow ninety. The  second cat will meow three times in fifteen seconds, while the first cat meows another three times. So far, the cats have meowed a total of nine times. One more cat, who meows one-third as frequently as the second cat, must meow to make the total number of meows to be exactly ninety. \n\nAfter counting the cat meows for three minutes, we will count the total number of minutes, which is five minutes. After calculating the number of seconds it takes for the second\ncat to meow ninety in five minutes, adding it to the 30 seconds per minute it takes the first cat to meow for five minutes. The third cat will meow for thirty seconds after the other two cats have been meowing for fifteen minutes in addition to counting for another fifteen minutes (a total of thirty seconds) for each of the other two cats meowing.

{"text": "125\n\n### Rationale:\n1. Keiko sent 118 texts last week. The problem states that she sent 50% less the week before. It also states that she sent 10% more this week compared to last week. From these, we can infer that last week she sent less than 110 texts and this week she sent more than 120 texts.\n2. From Keikos' texting patterns, last week, she sent over 110 texts. Since we already said that last week she sent under 110 texts, and this week she sent over 120 texts, we can use this information to further conclude that she sent a total of 115 texts last week and 129 texts this week.\n3. Therefore, from last week, she sent 111 texts, and this week, she sent 50 more than that number. So, she sent 129 - 111 = 18 texts this week, and therefore 111 + 18 = 129 = 129 texts last week and this week.

If Mario paid $ 18 dollar for the last haircut on monday, ho much he would have paid tat the day before.\n  Rationals:1. We are trying to evaluate price (in this case haircut price) on different days for a certain business.\n 2. The question states that haircuts cost 50% more at the weekends than they cost on Monday.\n 3. If it is assumed that the same hair cut prices are applied to every customer in a reasonable period of time, regardless of the day, then a customer who had a haircut on Monday would pay 50% more than the price applied a weekend day prior.\n 4. This means, that on any given Monday the price will be 1.5 times more than a price for a weekend before it.\n 5. The question asks how much Mario will pay one day before his latest haircut. Therefore, if we know the price on Monday we can compute the price on any given day prior.\n 6. Assume we know the price at a certain day, we multiply it by 0.5, because the price 50% higher for weekends (for each particular barbershop for a given day within a reasonable period where such price is applied).\n 7.

For simplicity, we can use 45 for the initial count of rabbits in the population. The rate of the disappearance of rabbits is expressed by the formula f(x)=(rate of fox hunting) x (duration of hunting).

{"text": "Each candy bar cost  $2. \n\n### Notes: \n\nThe solution requires a lot of mental processes. It relies on working backward from the total $28 to the total cost of the candy bars. \n* To obtain the unit price for the candy bars, multiply the total cost by the ratio of candy bars to soft drinks, which is 5:2 = 5:1.\n* To obtain individual prices, multiply the unit price by the total number of the items.\n* As a result, $28*5:1=2x8=2x$2=2*4=4; 4*2 =16; and 16/2 = 8; 8x$2 =$16.\n* The next step is to divide the $16 by 8 candy bars. 8x$2=16; $16/8 = 2; and 2x$2 = 2x$2=4; 4x$2=$16, so 2 candy bars cost $16, a total of $2 for 2 candy bars.\n* Conclusion: each candy bar costs $2.\n\n### Reference:\nKhan Academy-\"Price per unit calculation\" by Salman Khan https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra1-alg2/e/sneak_peek_priceperunit-problem\n\n##### Instructions: \nComplete the following task.\n\n### Input 9+8\n\n### Instructions:\nTo solve the addition of two addends, add those numbers and you will get the result 17.\n##### Input 7+6\n\n### Demostrations:\n\nTo Solve this task, you will need to add the two numbers together. \n\n## Input:\n\"What is the difference between 41 and 26\"?\n\n## Instructions:  Answer to the following addition.\n\n## Solutions:\n\n41 - 26 = 15\n\n## Input: 3+12\n\n## Demostration: \n\n4 + 6 = 10\n \n## Instructions \nHow many more cats are there than dogs in", "answer": " 4"}

{"text": "The total change is $1130.\n\n### Logical breakdown:\nWe have a series of expressions with percentages.\nWe apply laws of arithmetic\nWe apply algebraic manipulation with positive numbers\nWe can eliminate the middle, the food expense, as it is known how much Jessica will have to pay for it in total. She only needed a new answer to be able to answer the question.\nWe apply laws relating to multiplication and division\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThe original question is as follows:\n\nLast year Jessica paid for $1000 of rent, $20 with food, and $175 for car insurance,\n\nand now her food bill goes up 50%, and her insurance expenses almost triple due to the fact that Jessica was at fault in an automobile accident. How much more more does Jessica have to pay for her expenses in total?\n\nThe answer is $1133.\n\nWe then divide the cost of rent by 100 to make the expression a fraction, so:\n\n$1000,\n\nwhich is equal to:\n\n$\\frac{1000}{100}$, or approximately 10.\n\nWe then multiply this by 130%, meaning:\n\n$113$.\n\nWe repeat this until we reach 3,0,3 respectively.\n\nSo we have:\n\n$13 \\times 1.3, 13 \\times 0.5, 13 \\cdot 3$\n\nwhich is equal:\n\n$\\frac{\\big(13 \\times 3\\big)}{100}$\n\nwhich is equal approximately to:\n\n$\\approx 133$\n\nWe then add the amount of money Jessica saved on groceries.\n\nJessica saved $100 every year.\n\nTherefore, Jessica saved $10 every month, which is approximately equal to:\n\n$0.15$\n\nJessica saves $15 every month.\n\nWe are now able to calculate the grand total.\n\nFirst, we want to multiply the amount of rent Jessica pays by 0.15:\n\n$15 \\times \\frac{10}{100} = 0.", "answer": " 7200"}

{"text": "He would use the $0.50 a loaf to break even and then give the rest away.\n\n### Rationale: \n\nThe question states that \"Tommy is making 4 loaves of bread.\" This suggests that his total investment in making the bread is $4. He then needs \"4 pounds of flour\" for each loaves of bread, which is \"4lbs of flour per loaves of bread.\" Each 10-lb bag costs $10, and each 12-lb bag costs $3. This means that he can buy \"4lbs of 10-lb flour ($40) or 12lbs of 12-lb flour ($16)\" but he buys whichever he can get cheaper.\n\nThe question then states that Tommy will only buy the cheapest flour available \"to get enough.\" In other words, Tommy will buy all the flour he needs for each loaves of the bread he will make. When he is done, he won't have any flour left over.\n\nThe only remaining question is \"how much does he spend on each loaf?\" In order to make 12 loaves in total, Tommy must buy \"4lb of cheapest flour X = $N where N = 12\" Since he buys \"4lb of 12-pounds of flour,\" his total cost for flour is \"$4N.\" This means he uses \"$1.5N\" to \"break even and then give the remains away.\" He has 4 loaves of $0.50 each, and \"Tommy doesn't spend anything\" on the rest of the flour.", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "Natalie's has lost (5x8)/4 which is 4/4 which is the same amount she had before the summer. Her sister now has 8 diaries. \n\n### Reasoning:\n\nThis problem is asking for the total number of diaries that Natalie's sister has. Natalie's sister had initially 8 diaries in her locket and at the start of the summer she decided to buy double the amount of diaries she had at the time. This means that in the start of the summer her sister had 8+8 = 16 diaries in her loctor. In order to find out how her sister's collection has evolved we have to solve for the total number of lost diaries. We know that Natalie's lost 4/4 of the initial amount of diaries she started with so we can make the equation:\n\n\n```plain-text\n\n\n```\n\nfrom this we can make that her initial amount of lost was (5x8)/5 which yields out with 8 diaries.

{"text": "Choices:  A: 3,733 elephants/hour B: 1282 elephants/hour C: 36 elephants/hour D: 608 elephants/hour E: 95 elephants/hour\nRationales: This is the 3rd question in the series, therefore, we only have 2 more questions.\n\n### This question gives us the initial population and the outflow.\n1. The rate at which the elephants go out is 2,883 elephants in 4 hours or 700 elephants/hr.\n2. The rate at which new elephants enter is unknown so we cannot determine the amount at this time.\n3. This choice of questions is a little more difficult compared to the previous 2 questions. We will start by finding the outflow rate or outflow flow rate.\n4. The new population from the park would equal the outflow rate * time after the outflow rate. The population would be 2,884 elephants x 3 hrs = 8,642 elephants. But we do not know at this time what the final population would be, if the final population would 28,970 elephants then the new population would total  28,972 elephants.\n5. We can therefore determine that the outflow rate is 3 * the outflow rate\n6. This means the outflow rate is equal to 9,126 elephants\n7. There are 9,128 elephants total. Therefore, we will eliminate options A and B.\n8. If we have 1282 new elephants during the 7 hour process then there would be 1282 + 28,962 elephants = 29,244 elephants - 3 * 9128 elephant outflow\n9. We can therefore find the new elephant rate is 3488 elephants/hr\n10. We will therefore eliminate options C and D since they have higher numbers.\n11.

{"text": "![](2018-03-21_13-36-35500_3.jpg)\n\n### Rationale:\n> At first you think \"Oh, it would probably take the same amount of time for each worker...\" until you realize that it is a different type of problem:\n\nSam works by himself, making 1 widget every 30 minutes.\nJack works alone, making 2 complete widgets together every 60 minutes.\nTony works by himself, taking 80 minutes to make 1 widget.\n\nEach of the workers has a certain specialty. They work at a much faster pace, they are more likely to make a mistake(which will slow them down),\nand will do much worse when disturbed (or have to go somewhere), all of these are bad things for the factory. This means that the factory\nwon't give each worker the same workload. They just can't, since they are more efficient at some tasks.\n\nBut when you are in a rush and have a lot of people, it makes more sense to just hire and train many people to a certain task, rather than hiring better people.\n\nThen the question is how many workers should the factory have at their disposal, in order to match that speed?\n\nTony is already fast and efficient; he doesn't need any training and can do whatever task that's required of him in the fastest time possible,\njust like he works. Jack is at a reasonable speed as well; he can make 2 widgets when he is working alone,\nbut he is much faster when working alongside Sam, so he is able to assist as well.\n\nSam, on the other hand, is best to use alone: his workload is reduced and he takes less time than Jack when they work together,\nso if he takes 30 minutes to do the work for 1 widget alone, then he can finish another 3 widgets in the same amount of time it takes Jack\nto finish 1 widget. 3 * 30=90 minutes. So Sam produces 90 widgets in 60 minutes, or 3/4 of what Jack does in the same amount of\ntime, with the same tools.\n\nAssuming that we don't have any uncertainties about Tony(the worker who we are", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "46\n\n### Rationale:\n1. The question asks us to find out how many grandchildren a person named Max has.\n2. Each of Max's children have the same number of children, except for 2, who have 5 children instead.\n3. From this, we can deduce that his children each have a total of 4 children. This implies Max himself has a grand total of 8 children.\n4. As for the rest of the question, Max's children have 8 children each, so they each have 8 x 8, or 64 children. When we multiply 64 by 2 since Max has 2 children among the 8 who are exceptions, we attain 128.\n5. Then, we can subtract the number of grandchildren that each of Max's children has. Max only has 8 children, and each one of his children has 8 children, but they each have 2 children who have 5 children, or 10 children in total, resulting in 128 - 10, so Max's grandchildren are exactly 46.\n\n### Input 2: There are 16 students in a class.

The question is asking us to find out how the proportion of students that play soccer compares to students who don't play soccer among the entire class.\n2. The proportion of students who play soccer every week is obtained by considering the number of students who play saturday every week, plus the number of students who plays 3 saturdays, plus the number of those who plays 2 saturdays, plus 4 times the number of students who only plays 1 saturday.\n        \n  The number of students who do not play soccer that week will cancel with the number of students who does play soccer all together.\n        \n3. Sixteen is the answer because, if we only assume that all who play soccer do all the time, then we are left with a situation where all play soccer every week, while those who do not play saturday are zero", "answer": " 58"}

We need to count all the people first, which means that we first count the members of the family and then the number of legs per member when we know who they are.\n\n1. We are not going to count the number of legs per animal because the question specifies that there is 1 cat and 2 dogs in the family.\n\n2. The question mentions Javier\u2019s wife, but doesn\u2019t specify if she has any legs. Because of this, we add 1 to our total number of legs because there are 4 legs per human.\n\n3. We also add the total number of legs each of the children have.\n\n4. The first two children have 2 legs each and the third child has 3 legs. Therefore, we add 2 + 2 + 3 = 7 to our total number of human legs.\n\n5. Based on the answer, we have Javier\u2019s wife being 4 and her children being 2, 2, and 3 - 2 legs each. Therefore, we add that to our total as well.\n\n6. The addition of the legs for Javier\u2019s wife and his children gives us a total of 4 + 7 = 11, which is then added to the answer of 2 to give us 13.\n\n7. Javier has 4 total legs so his total number of legs in the household is 13 + 4 = 17.\n\n### Input:\"The next item I bought was a toothbrush. The cost of the toothbrush is $2.

{"text": "2 hours\n\n### Input :A large group of tourists, 7000 people with an average height of 170 cm, visit the museum, how many children in the group?\n### Demonstation:\n\nRationales:\n1. The question involves determining how many \"children\" would be \"in the group\". Based on the premise that the average height of the entire group is 170 cm (about 5 feet and 7 inches), we can estimate an adults height to be about 190 cm (about 6 feet) and children under 170 (4 feet and 11 inches). This gives us a rough approximation of the height variance between the children and adults, in which adults would be taller about 20 cm (about 8 inches) on average while children would be shorter by about 20-25 cm (about 8-10 inches). Therefore, if we use an average size estimate of about 150 cm for children, then about 4,600 children would be in the group because 7,000 - 1,400 = 5,600 = 4,608 \u00f7 2 = 2,304 children because there are 7,00-2000 = 5000 adults and 7000 - 5000 - 2000 =2000 =1999 children.\n2. Similarly, using the same average height estimate of 150 cm, then there would be about 2,800 adults in the group.\n3. Therefore, the answer would be 2,80o adults and 4,60 children (with about 200 adults in all) so the answer is: 2,80 + 4,60 = 7,400 or about 7,448 (rounded).\n\n### Input - Question 2:\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Rationales:\n1 - 2 - 3 -", "answer": " 10"}

Firstly, every family with zero dogs must be surveyed. Next, 50 families that have three or more dogs must have their information recorded. Finally, every family with zero cats must be surveyed. The results of the survey indicate that 100 families have dogs. If a school is to be built within the community, then how many families would need to be relocated?\n\n### Options:10. This is because every family with less than three dogs in the community with dog numbers greater than six will be relocated.\n20. This is because the number of homes that would require relocating is the population of the community subtracting the homes that are to be relocated.\n5. This is because every third family would need to be surveyed to find its dog number.\n15. This is because this question refers back to question 1. If 100 families are found to have dogs they would need to be survey. It is also important to take note that the other families that have one or zero dogs would be considered as having no dogs.\n\n### Reasoning:\nThe 100 families with dogs correspond to a population of 328 (i.e. 1,000/3 dogs in the population).\nWe know that 50 families have dogs in excess of 3, for 1,500, so 1,501-1,500=1.\n\nWe then add back in the families with dogs of 0 or 1 and we have a population of dogs of 328+1=329.\nIf 100 have dogs as was", "answer": " 80"}

On Sunday, Brian's friend John decided to eat 2 slices of the one remaining pizza.  What fraction of a slice of pizza does John eat if Brian has 4 slices left and Jen has 4 slices?\n\n#### Response:Answer the following question for grade 5 math.\n\n#### Rationales:\n5. The task provides information on the number of pizzas, how they were split between people and how much each person ate from the 18 pizzes.  Therefore, we have the information we need to solve  for the answer.\n6. First, we look at the number of pizzes and the fraction that each person ate.  Knowing that Brian and Jen ate a pizza for a  day means that 18/7 = 2.67 and Jen's pizza represents 4/7.\n7. We can subtract 2.67 from 4/7 to get 2.67 -4/7, and divide 2.67 by -4/7 or 3. 3 is the final number of slices of pizza Brian and Jen can consume. \n8. Jen can therefore eat 4 - (3-4/7) slices, or (4 - 3)/7 of a slice or 1/7 of a slice of pizzas.  John can then eat 3 - (1/7) or 3 - (0.143) slices", "answer": " 50"}

This means avocados * servings.\n\nNow in the question you already had 5 avacados, however, she needs 3 to make the recipe. This means, that she needs to first subtract 2, from the original result.\n\nThis now gives her 15 servings of gucamole.\n\nNow you might be asking yourself, \"but what about the sister?\"\n\nThis is a way of making the question.

However, Lavinia\u2019s is not younger-Katie. Therefore, Lavinie\u2019son is half the age of Lavinia\u2019daughter. Now let us see how to find the answer:\nIn 12 years Katie\u2019s youngester will be 12/10 older than her. That\u2019s why Katie\u2019s youngetter daughter will be 2.6 years old than Katie\u2019s youngestro daughter.

If they sold each at 1/5 of the original purchase price was their profit more than $7900?\n\n### Rationale:\nIn order to calculate the profit, we need to determine the purchase price of the trucks. Here, \"old\" does not indicate the age of the trucks, but rather the fact that they are surplus, or that the company already has the trucks. Therefore, the purchase price is the original price they bought, or the initial amount of money the trucks cost.\n\n```Python\nans = 10000*(15-7)*(5-7)\nans = int(10000* ((15-7)/5.0)* (((5-7)/5/5-7)\n```\n### Response: Since $10000 is the total sales ($10 - 7900), the answer $210.\n\n### Response Question with a range of answer options\n1.

{"text": "Answer the question based on the information given in the sentence.\n\n### Detailed solution (Optional):\nThe amount of practice Johnny currently has is 15 days. Half of this is equal to 7.5 days of practice. Thus, Johnny has played for a cumulative of 22.5 days. So assuming that he will continue playing the same amount, he would equal the total of 27 days (22.5+5). In other words, he has accumulated 27 days of total practice. The question provides that, \"as of 20 days\" ago, Johnny had played for 15, or half of 27, days. This means that for every day passed, Johnny accumulated 3 days. So if Johnny plays for 1 day, he will have a total of 4 days of total practice. If he plays for 2 days, he has a total of 6 days of practice. And so on. Therefore, for every day passed, he will have a cumulative of 3 days added to his total practice.\n\nTherefore, this means that he needs to accumulate 27 new days of practice to equal triple the amount of his current practice. Since all we know is that he plays for 1 day on the first day, a more simple method is to solve: \\(107\\) = \\(15t\\).\n\nThus, \\(15t=107\\).\n\nSubtract the 15 from both sides to get \\(6=t\\).\n\nSubtitute 20 for t and 7 for \\(15\\) to get 60=27+5\n\nThe total practice after 27 days of playing is 60 days.\n\nAnswer: 60 days\n\n### Instructions:Answer the question based the given information.\n\n### Solution (Detailed):\nTo answer the question, we should find the amount of practice Johnny currently plays each day.

{"text": "In the first 2/3, explain how you used the process described in the lesson and applied it to solve the task.\nIn the last third describe the solution path you took to arrive at your answer.\n\n### Response\n#### Demonstration\nI can see that there are 2 things that are required to determine the answer.\n1: What is the current combined age of Josh and Anna?\n2: How old was Josh when he got married with Anna?\nThe combined age of Josh and Ana will be 30 times the 22 of Josh's age, which means:\n```\n30*22 = 660\n```\nI can understand that Anna's age is 3 times the Josh's age, so the answer of those 2 formulas will give the age of Anna when she got married.\n```\nAnna Age = 20 years\nJosh Age = 22 years\n```\n#### Rational\nI saw several concepts that I used in the problem in this lesson:\n1: Determine the process and ask questions\n2: Applying algorithms to get the answer\n3: Reasoning - by determination the age of Anna when he got married\n\n### Response 2\n\nThe process I followed was that I followed the steps in the lesson and I used two formulas to solve the problem.\nFor the first formula, I understood that the combined age should be 30 times and then, divide the value 30 by 2 and the result was 15. I understood that Anna's age was approximately 2 times Josh's age. Finally we could solve for Anna's age by taking the result of `22` minus 2 and getting `20` and using the second formula: `Anna's age = 3 times Josh's age`. The result was `Anna's Age = 20`\n\n### Response3\n\nThe process I used was:\n- I determined the process of the problem, then I asked myself 2 things:\n  - How old was Josh when they got married?

The dog was running with a speed of 4/7 m/s. How long did the dog take to catch the ball? Choices: 1 1/2 hours A: 3 minutes B: 2 hours and 30 minutes C: 3 minutes and 15 seconds D: 11/2 hours E: 1 hour\nRationales:1.The question is about the time taken by a dog to catch a ball when the ball is 1 1/12 metres away from the dog and the dog is moving with a speed of 8/9 m/s. It implies that the distance and speed will both significantly affect the time taken to catch the ball.\n2.Looking at the answer choices, we can eliminate choices A and E for two reasons. Choice A implies that the dog ran for 1 1/3 hours, which cannot be correct as the dog would not likely continue to run a large distance after catching the ball. Similarly, Choice E states that the dog ran for almost an hour, which is also not consistent with the facts.\n3.Choice B states that the dog caught the ball in 2 hours. We know that the ball was thrown 1 1/5 metres away from the dog, but the dog ran for 8/9 m.s, which means that the ball was actually brought back to the dog at 1/4 of the distance in the opposite direction. Hence, we know from the context that the dog travelled ~ 3 metres and not 1 1/8m, as stated by the option.\n4.Furthermore, the option's solution, 3 minutes, makes sense in terms of catching the ball as the dog ran for ~1 m after it was thrown, and the dog ran for ~3 m before the ball was thrown.\n5.These considerations indicate that Option B is the most accurate answer, as the dog ran a total of 3 m before and after catching the ball, and reached its end position within a time of 3 minutes.", "answer": " 42"}
{"text": "The final weight of the box is less than 20.0, because\n\nThe final weight of the box after all treats have been added is 20.9 pounds.\n\n### Rationale: \n\n### Input and Explanation: \n\nGiven the box, the number of jelly beans added, the weight of the box with those jelly beans, and each addition, the final weight can be calculated before adding the gummy worms.\n\n### Answer:\nThere are 879 treats in this box, including the jelly beans, gummy worms, and brownies. If each treat can be weighed on a scale so that the weight is recorded with two decimal places, then the final weight of the complete box can be determined using the formula, [Weight of box + weight of treat] / 2.\n\n### Solution:\nGiven\n\n- weight of box added the amount of jelly beans (2.00 lbs)\n\n- weight of the box with the added amount of jelly beams  \n-( 2.000 )\n\n- weight of weight of box with gummy worms added\n\n...\n\n- weight of gummy worms\n\nUsing the formula to determine the unknown variable of a set of equations to determine the final weight of the treats in the box, the formula is \n\n[Weight of box + weight + treat] / 2 = [weight of box + weight of treats] / 2\n\nIn the above scenario, we can replace the amount of jelly and gummy worms with their unit and weight.\n\nThen, the above formula can be simplified to\n\n((2.000 + ((n-2.000)* n) /2 = (2.000*n) / \u200b 2\n\nAfter rearranging the above formula to solve for the variable of n, we get\n\n$$(2.000/n - 2.00) = (2.0 /n ))\n\nUsing the division property, the above formula gets simplified to\n\n$$(8/n=20 / 8)$$\n\nSince the divisor is 8.000 and the numerator is 8.0, we are left with the following", "answer": " 16"}

That means he has to work for three months to have enough money to buy the shoes. He has $81 left for lawn and driveway mowing jobs. Therefore, he will have to mow 30 driveways and shovel 9 lawns to get enough money to afford the shoes, which will cost him $95.\nRationales:\n- The question is about buying a pair of shoes for $95.\n- $95 is 3 more than $92\n- Tobias has $81 left\n- He got $32 from mowing lawns and $7 from shoveling driveways.\n- That leaves $42 to spend\n- Tobias needs to shovel 5 driveways to get $42.

If we were to subtract $150 ($2000-$1850), which is how much he spent on creating the movie, that is how much profit James makes per week.\n\nSince we are given in the question that James sells 50% more DVDs on weekends.

{"text": "B\n\n### Instructions: 44/53 = 4 and 11/10 = 11\nRationales: Let's get the word problem down into 2 cases where we can clearly understand what we're subtracting from each other to start with. With the first number to subtract, it's 4 x 5, or 20. This is 25 miles x 5, and that's pretty close to 20 miles. Now, the second number to subtract is 11 x 7, and we're subtracting about 75 miles x 7. And that doesn't work as well. But notice how they're close. So, 20 vs 25 is close to 75 vs 11. But that doesn't really go that way. And that is the reason you want to know the ratios. I'll use this 75 / 11 to demonstrate it. Now, the denominator is 11 so, if 20 is close, 75 has to equal 11 / 5 which is about 2. So, 2 x 7. Now, 75 / 5 is 15 / 5. 15 is 3 x 5 = 15. Now, the denominators are matched correctly, but look at the numerators. That's pretty big difference between 3 and 2. So, that tells me that I need to subtract the larger number first, or I'll get some huge denominators here and a difference that is too large for my subtracting skills. So, I'll subtract 75 first to get 205 because that happens to be 20 x 5. And now, I have, I hope 15 / 1. This isn't that great because 5 and 1 don't match at all. But I'll subtract 1 to get 4 x 1, but you know, we're already done. So, if we use 20 x 7 = 140 miles x 4 weekdays and 40 x 6 = 240 miles off weekend, that's a total of 240 miles biking a week. 320 - 240 = 80 miles", "answer": " 16"}

So that combination is out.\n5. 1000 does work, but only if Benedict's house is 800. Because it's 200, Benedict's house can't be 1000 because that would mean 4 times 250, and we can't have 250 times some number that we have already used.\n6. Let's try our last combination - 1000, Benedict will be 400 and Kennedy will be 40,000.\n7. If 1000 means 400, then that would mean 40 in the other direction, but we used it in the Benedict part.\n8.

Each plant has 1Seed and he plants 68% of those seeds. \nWhat number of trees did he plant? \nStep 1: We break down the question into smaller parts:\nPlants - We have two trees with 20 plants each, so, total = 40.\nFor each plant, we have 1 seed (we multiply one seed with 20 plants to get total number of seeds).\n68% = (68/100) * 1 Seed.\nStep 2 : We can replace total 40 plants and replace 100% with 68% because we are replacing all seeds with the 68%\nStep 3 : Since we are trying to find total number of trees that James has planted, we must try to plug the percentage in the 40 plants.\n288 trees x 100 = 100%\n3216 seeds x100 = 68%\n68% = 3216/8144 so 68%=40 plants, we replace 40 plants from above and then we divide 288 trees with 40 to get the answer 288 trees. \nStep 4 : We want to plug the 68% into 288 trees, so 288 * 68% = 288*68% = 68 seeds. \nNow 68 seeds divided by 20 plants = 3.4 plants per seeds, we plug this into 40 and get 3.4 * 40 = 136. \nStep 5 : We can now replace 136 with 20 and get 136 divided by 20 = 7 seeds at the end, the total number of planted trees is 40+7 = 47. \nStep 6 : Now we replace 7 with 100 because we're trying to find number of trees that James planted. \nStep 7 : We", "answer": " 24"}

In each equation, we were trying to remove the value of \"y\" so that the remaining equation consisted only of the value for \"x\". The second equation was easier to do because the value of \"x = 100\" existed in the original equation, so we subtracted that value to create an equation that contains only \"y\".

Choices : A: high heels B: boots C: sneakers D: flip flops E: sandals\n\n### Instructions:Answers the question as instructed in the paragraph above.\n\n### Reasons/Explanations:A forest is an environment for animals to live in. Animals usually use their sense of hearing to survive, so a good way to walk through a forest without making noise is to walk very softly, or even better, not at all. Wearing shoes with a lot of material makes a lot of noise. High heels and boots are both very stiff and might be hard to walk in very quietly. Flip-flops and sandals have a lot of material and a lot of stuff that could scrape or squeak against the floor. Sneakers probably have too much material to walk very quietly in, unless you know a way to walk through a thickly wooded area in sneakers without making a lot of noise.\n### Instrucation(s) : The shoes that would allow you to sneak around quietly in a forest would be light sneakers with soft soles and little or no material.

{"text": "Each candy bar costs $5.40 because 5 candy bars * $4 each = $20  and he spent $28 for 2 items making the total $56.\n\n### Explanation: The solution to this problem is based on the fact that Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each, and bought 1 more drink than he bought candy bars.\n\n### Solution: The first step is to calculate how many candy bars he purchased. We know that he purchased 5 candy bars ($5.48 * 18 cents) and bought 1 soft drink left. Therefore, if he bought 2 drinks for $4 then the second one is free. He spent a total amount of 28 dollars on this. We subtract 4 from 28 to get 24 dollars and this means we have $24 remaining.\n\n2 candy bars * 5.40 = $5.48\n\nThe second step is to calculate the difference between the cost for two candy bars with the cost for two soft drinks.\n\nThe difference between 2 candy bars and 2 soft drinks is 8 dollars.\n\n$20 minus 24 equals 4. We know that when subtracting numbers, you cannot have a decimal so we must divide 4 by 2 to get the answer which equals 2.\n\nBenny spent 2 dollars for each candy bar.\n\n#### Challenge\n\nYou are a new employee at Big Mart. Your boss has hired you to work at the cash register at the front of the store.  The store has a new policy this week - all candy bars must cost $1.49.

{"text": "The answer should be 1.23 pounds per day\n\n### Analysis:\nIn the question, the question asks about how many pounds of peanuts to buy to get the best deal, since there are only 50 cents more than the cost the question is asking for.\n\nFirst, one should make a list of all the denominations, and count up the total. So the total denominations should be $3 + $5 + $10 + $20 = $50. The only denominations that don't reach 50 are the fives and twenties.\n\nAfter counting the denominations, the first thing you want to do is add the amount of money in each denomination for the total value. For this, you would add the total values of each of the denominations together. Since there are only $4 in change, we know that $4 must be in fifty cents. $4 is also half the total amount of the denomination, so we'll count that too. We've only counted the change once because we don't include the change amount for each denomination.\n\nThat said, the total amount of change for the denomination is $2. After we count the amount of change, we still need to count up the fives again and count the amount of twenties.\nWe see that the total value of the change is $2, which comes to $20, so we've counted the fives once and twenty each. \n\nNow, since the total value of the fives and tweties combined is 45, we add the 45 and the total value of change is $67. \n\nTo get the answer, we have to subtract the total of the denominations, the total change, and the pound of peanuts in each, with what is left of the total of the denominators and the total of the change. So, with the question saying to subtract, we will subtract $3.00 by 2.5 times the denominators.\n\nSince the answer is less than 2 of the denominators, we subtract 2 and get:\n\n$7\\times2\\times5\\times4\\times1.5\\times2.5$ = $67.50 - $2.5 = 65 $\n\nSince the question wanted the amount", "answer": " 3"}

{"text": "The prize will be $4\n\n### Explanation:\nLily earns $5 from selling the first ticket and spends $1, and she earns $6 from selling the second ticket and spends $2, and so on. Lily ends up with $4 as a profit and $1 as the remaining money.  If she divides the $4 profit by the number of tickets she sold, then divides by 100, she will end up with a prize of $4.\n\nThe logic used to find the answer is as follows:\n\nWe begin with Lily's expenses, which represent the remaining money after she spent $1 for buying the first ticket. These expenses equal to $1.\n\nWe continue by adding Lily's incomes together with the expenses on hand. To do this, we sum the dollar amounts of Lily's revenues with the amounts she spent for buying each ticket. These incomes equal $5. This sum is the same as the expense, which is our starting value of $1.\n\nNow that we've identified the original amount as well as the sum of Lily's incomewithher expenses, we subtract the starting value from the total. When we subtract, we get $4.\n\nAs a final step, we divide $4 by the number of tickes that Lily sold in order to find the value of the prize per ticket.

{"text": "The answer is 60 days. \n\n### Rationale 1: From the question, we know that the castle is able to feed 30% more people than the original number that lived there for 90 days with no problem. \n\nAfter 15% decrease in the number of people in the castle, the castle should only be able to feed 72% as many people as it did in the beginning, since it contains 100% fewer calories.\n\n### Rational 2: The question gives us the number of days they have had food left by subtracting and adding 15 days. This makes sense, because it takes 300 people 30 days to consume 90% of the food. This makes sense because there are 15 more people to feed, so it should take them an equivalent amount of time.

Therefore, we can't directly use step 1 to determine the number of occupied spaces.\n\n50 (1.65-1)/1.65 = 158.4\n\nThe number of occupied seats is 158. However, this is not the number of seats in the enclosed venue, but rather the number of seats available during the event.\n25/11 of the 720 seats in attendance are occupied during the event", "answer": " 1500"}
{"text": "83\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question reads \"Tony was able to help out.....\" Then we know Tony helped for the whole shift. Since Tony is new, he won't work as fast. So he made 1 widget every 8 minutes, or 80 (1/8). Sam and Jack together put together 1 widget every 5 minutes because they work together. That leaves us with 33 (1-80) more. 90 (1+80) and 55 (5-33)=90 (1+55) is the number of workers that have assembled in one day. So one of them is Tony, so 90-1 is 89. 89x 80= 7480. Then it says \"at the end of the day\". He made 7 widgets, and they made 68, so one is left over, which he did. 80-1=79. 79x80 is 6320. So 68+6320=6398. 6398-78. That means Tony makes 83 (6398 -78)\n\nRATIONALE FOR: 68 - 69 / 69 - 8 = 83\n\nThis answer choice is supported by what we already know from the question - Sam and Jack were able to put together two complete widgets in 15 minutes each, but Tony was unable to assemble the widgets with Sam and Jack (because he couldn't match their speed), and ended up having to produce the remaining 33 widgets alone, which took him a total of 83 minutes. The total time taken for all the completed widgets is 68 + 6320 = 6398 minutes.\n\nFrom this information, we can deduce that Tony completed his first widget (68 - 6320/33) = 68 - 19 = 49 minutes; the second (6320/78 = 80) = 5 minutes; the third (6320-3*80 = 1980- 240 = 1740) = 35 minutes ; the fourth (632", "answer": " 30"}

The question implies that you can have A pieces when your parents aren't upset, but we can replace that with another set of questions, \"if you took 3 pieces of candy, your parents would be upset, but still if you took A, they wouldn't be upset, what is A?\" The second set of questions has the same set of answer choices, so the answer to the question is B: 4.\n\n### Example 1: I saw that you were wearing a dress.\n### Response 1: And you knew that I had seen you wearing a dress.

The puppy's full adult weight after 7 weeks was 6, which meant that it was 6 pounds when it was 7 weeks old. By the end of week 9, it doubled again to 12. By end of month 3, it doubled again until it became 146. So we have 6, 12, 24 and finally 146. \n\n### Democracy:\nOkay. So what did you figure out? You were able to get to the final adult weight from the initial weight by using your knowledge about this dog. That's great!\n\n### Learners:\nYah!

In the first part of the question, if we add half of Ed's shoe's (the given number) and half of Brian's shoes (given that we're asked about the total number of shoes), we get one third of Jacob's shoes, because Jacob has one half of Ed's (whose number we already know). \n\nB.

From here, all we need is to multiply this sum by 2 (since we already have the number of pairs Brian has, which is 22).\n\n### Tips for doing addition and subtraction:\nTo solve the question above, we have to do a sum and a subtraction. To do a sum, we first have to figure out the relationship between these two numbers. \nLet's say we write them on the left and right sides.\nWe know that we have to do 3x, so we know that one side has to be 3 times the number on the other side, and the other side has to be equal to the first side, so the rightside is 4x (because, as Jacob already had 1x, and he now has 1x + 2x because Brian has 22, it means that Jacob has 22 pairs). The first side is (or we can put it as) ((Edward + Brian) * 3).\n\nTo do a subtraction however, you need to subtract (or do a subtraction):\nNow, to do a subtraction (which is what we have to do), first make a small subtraction: Jacob-Edward = Brian, and do this again: Edward-Brian = Jacob.

{"text": "There are three answers to the question:\n23 times,\n5 times\n\n### Rationales:\nThe total number of people waiting to ride the roller coaster is 84. There are 7 cars and each car can hold 2 people, which results in 36 rides per car. So to give everyone a turn, the operator will have to ride the rollercoaster a total of 84/36 = 23 times.\n\nThere are 84 different people waiting, which means that there are 148 total rides. Each car can only hold a maximum of 2 people, so if each car could hold 36 people, then the operator would ride 40 times to give everyone a turn - 40 = 5 times.\n\n148\u00a0 / 36 = 4 times = 4\n\nHowever, 4 times 2 people = 8 people. Therefore, the actual total amount of car rides is 156 (84x35/148).\n\nSubtract 8 people from the total amount of rides to get 148 (156 - 8), which equals to 23.\n\nHence, answer is 23.\nAnswer: 23\n\n### Rationale:\nThe total number waiting to ride is 84. \nEach car can seat maximum of 2 people.\nHence, 84 divided by 36 = 2\nSo, the operator would ride the roller coater 2 times\n\n### Instructions:\nAnswer the following question.\n\n## DRAFT.

(I like re-usig jokes!!!)\n4. Solve the entire problemaat without using algebra!\nLet's start using logic.\n1. The largest hole leaks 3 oz/ min, so you would get 18 oz/hour for this hole.\n2. The medium-sized whole leaks 50% of the larger one, so it leaks 9 oz/ min.  So you would get 54 oz/ hour for this hole.\n3. The smallest hole leaks 1/3 of the medium-size one, or 3 oz. So that would be another 9 oz/ hour. \n\nSo what is 9 + 18 + 9 = 36 or 45 (36 if you round) \n\nBut you cannot have an odd number in the amount of ounces you get for the first two holes because the last hole's amount would be 3/3rd, and we know the largest hole is not  3/3rd.     \n\nSo, 18 + 54 = 72 then the last hole would be 1/3rd of 72. This last hole is a 48 oz/ hr. 72 + 48 = 120     \n\nBut that is an odd number of ozs so we can't have it.

{"text": "He had four extra cupcakes.\n\n### Rationales: \n\nWe can find the answer by subtracting the cupcakes he gave out from the amount he brought, i.e. the cupcakes he had left over.\n\n### Response 2: I see, we can subtract to find how many cupcakes he had remaining. We are taking away 18 + 16 + 5 + 5, but we don't really know how many cupcakes each person had.\nCourse content: Response 2: No one actually knows the number of cupcakes he had per person he gives a cupcake to (Ms. Delmont, each student in Ms. Delmond's class, as well as the school nurse and the school principal, etc.). Thus, we can subtract from the number of cupcates he brought, but not subtract 1 cupcake from 18. We would end up subtracting from more than 18. \n\n### Answer to the problem\n\nFrom the choices, Donnelly had 2 more, Delmont had 4, the nurse had one more, and the principal had four.\nWe first add to Delmont's count to find her 32.\nThen, we subtract 20 from Donnelly's count to find she has 16 remaining.\nNext, we add to the nurse's count to get 25.\nFinally, we subtract 4 from the principal's count to get to 36.\n\nTherefore, Delmont has a total of 2 fewer cupcakes than she started with.\nDonnelly has a total of 16 cupcakes left (16 more than her count).\nThe nurse has a total of 5 extra (5 total more than her count).

Its \nlength is 1 metre less than twice its width, which is 8 metres.\n\nThe government wants to fence in the 4 metre-wide flowerbed.\nHow many metres of fencing are needed?\n\nRationales: To begin with, we need to find the answer the question is looking for. This is done by finding the area of the flowerbed, which is the length of the rectangle multiplied by the width of the rectangle. \nTo do this, first we need to find the length of the rectangle. We can do this because the question specifies that the length is 1 metre shorter than two times the width.\nSo, the length is simply: \n2(width) - width; which is: width.\n\nBecause the length is simply the width of the rectangle multiplied \nby 1 (using the rule that the length of the rectangle is equal\nto twice its width), the area of the entire flowerbed is simply\n4 multiplied by the length, which is 4 meters squared.\n\nHowever, this answer does not answer the question as \na square would not make sense to fence, since the flowerbed\nis rectangular-shaped, not square.\n\nAnswer: To determine how much fence the government must use (by determining how much the total length of the flowerbed to fence would be),\nall we must do is determine the width of the flowerbed,\nas we already know it is 4 metres wide; thus,\n4 x width = x. \n\nNow, the government will need to use\n4 x width fence, but the width of \nthe", "answer": " 22"}

{"text": "The probability that both lawsuits are won by Andy is `(5/8)^2`. The probability that Andy loses both of them is `(5/8)(2/4)^2 + (5/8)(1/4)^2` = 41.6%\n\n### Justification:\nTo compute this, let's first examine the probabilities from the two lawsuits. For the first, the probability the lawsuit pays out $5,010,000 to Andy (if he wins) is `(5/8)`. The probability the lawsuit will pay out $0(if he loses) is `(1/8)`. So, the probability of winning the first lawsuit can be expressed as `(5/8)/(1/8)` or `(5/8)^1`. For the second lawsuit, let's say that since Andy can win or lose the second lawsuit based on a 50-50 chance, the probability that the lawsuit will pay Andy $2,00100,00 for him winning or pay $0 if he losesses can then be expressed as `(2/4)/(1/4)` or `(2/4)^2`.\n\nNow, all that's left is to add these probabilities up to compute the overall odds of one outcome versus the other. To compute this, let' use the formula that calculates the probability of X events occurring for a set N events. We will then have to use a PIE notation to express the formula to get the result we're looking for. This is because multiplying `(5/8)^(1/8)` by `(2/4)^(1/4)` is equivalent to adding `(5/8)^P(lawsuit 1 wins) * (2/4)^P(lawsuit2 wins)` where P is a probability value that computes the odds of winning and loosing. This is where this formula comes in: P(X_i) = (1+X)^{N-1} - 1.\nApplying this to the question, we can express this as P1 = `(5/8)^(?-1)X1 * (2/4) * (1/4) = `(5/8)*(?-1)*((2/4)^2/1)` because X1 represents the win/lose of lawsuit 1 while X", "answer": " 20"}
{"text": "Bart bought pages. Choices:  A.$83.75 B.$90.00 C.$96.00 D.$144.00 E.None of these\n\n### Response Explanation:\nThe key step is to understand that the number of pages in notepads is represented by the unit of cents (1 penny = 1 cent), rather than the number of units of notepads ($10).\nStep 1: The problem contains information in the following format:\n  Bought     Price     Quantity\n    -------    ------     -------\n   10         1.25      60\nStep 2: The question asks for 60. We know 60 is the unit quantity, it makes sense to ask for how many units this quantity is worth. \nStep 3: In the first step, the dollar amount in the left value in the 2nd column was not specified so we assumed that this is the total amount of money Bart has purchased. The price per page is $0.125.\nStep 4 In the above 3 step, we get $45 which is exactly the sum of the first number in third column - 10 which is the number of notepads and the last number in third column - $45 from the 1st number in fourth column - $60 which is the sum of all page quantity - 60. \nStep 5 In the above 5 step we have $45 = 10* $4.5. Therefore, the total pages purchased using first number of 2nd column is $4.5.\nStep 6 By taking 4.5 from the 10th line we get $5.5 and the remaining 9.5 from 10th - 5.5 is the total pages purchased. \nStep 7 9.5 is exactly the same amount as 5th number in 4th column - 9.5 which is the price per page. \nStep 8 Therefore, by multiplying amount of pages bought by $5.5 is the answer $5.5.\nSo, the answer is $5.5. \nAnswer: E.None of these.\n\n### Input:- How many cents are a quarter worth?

{"text": "Alice sold 80 oranges.\n\n### Rationale:The question is asking to calculate how many oranges Alice sold based on the information given. \n1 The information given is about Alice's sales compared to Emily's.\n2 From the information given, we know that Alice sold twice as many as Emily, so the number of oranges Alice sold should be double the number of Emily's. \n3 Furthermore, Alice, Emily and the total number of oranges sold must be a multiple of 370 since 370 sold oranges is equivalent to 180, which is a multiple. \n4 So, since Alice and Emily sold a multiple of 360, Alice's sold oranges must also be a multiple of 180. \n5 From the information given, the equation can be \n6 Alice's sold orangess = ((180 \u00f7 2) \u25cf 180) \u2248 80\n7 Thus, the answer is choice C: 80 oranges (2/3 x 2x370 = 80 ).\n\n### Input I was looking for something to read and discovered a journal.\n\n### Response I found a journal that I was looking for.\n\n### Input Is this sentence correct?

There are two animals and they chase an animal.\n\nSteps 3, 4  The word 'duck', 'raccoon', 'bird', and'squirrel' do not match the description that we've got, that is, the dog and cat is chasing an animal. The description implies that the animal has to be bigger than the dog and cat, which the duck, the rabbit, and the squirrel do not. 'Bird' is also a much looser term that can be considered anything smaller and lighter than the cat. 'Raccoon' is considered a medium sized animal, which is not much bigger than a cat (much bigger than a dog, but smaller than a cat).\n\nSteps 5, 6  However, 'rabbit' and'squirrel', the answer, match all the criteria that we've got. The rabbit and the squirrel are the only ones that could be called the 'bigger animal' while the cat and dog could be called the'smaller animals'.\n\nSteps 7, 8  The choice that matches all the criteria is 'rabbit' as its only counterpart is 'dog' which we've eliminated earlier and 'bird' which doesn't even exist as the question is talking about animals that is bigger and chased by the dog and cat.\nAnswer: D - 'rabbit' - the dog and cat is a chase after a bigger rabbit than a raccoon, duck, and bird.\n\n### Answer: B- 'raccoon'.\n\n### Input The teacher explained where the test was given.

In order to get to the answer, we need to determine whether or not the choice says that they do like the woman's attire.\n\nSo, if we assume that the woman has on a new dress, the choice indicates a 'no': we will reject the option. \nNow, we have B, C, and D.

{"text": "15 students like French fries\n10 students like burgers\n6 students like both French fries & burgers\n5 students like neither food\n\n### Rationales: 1) The question asks about how many of the 25 students do not like the foods. The response starts by telling us 15 students like French Fries, 10 like Burgers, and then 6 students like both. This shows how many students like French Fries and Burgers. Since there are also 5 students who like neither, that is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 since 6 students like French Fries AND Burgers, we only need 5 other students to like neither food in order to have a total of 15 students who like French Fries and 10 students who like Burgers. 2) The question does not ask, \u201cIn a class of 30 students, what is the total of students that like French Fries, Burgers, or Both?\u201d\n\nInput: What's in a babies favorite place to play at home? Choices: \n   A: table B: couch C: kitchen D: window E: closet\nRationales:The question is asking for the favorite play place of a baby. It can only be an inside option because it has to be inside the house.\n\nFirst, we can eliminate B: couch because it's a piece of furniture and not a location. Also, it would be uncomfortable for a baby to play on the couch.\nNext, we can eliminate A: table because a table is a surface; it's not a place.\nAlso, we can eliminate C: kitchen because a kitchen is a place where there is food and it should be a place where the baby is forbidden from playing.\nNext, we will eliminate D: window because a window is not a place.\nFinally, we select E: the closet because it's a secret place, and it's probably an area where the baby can put toys.\nThe answer is E: closet.\n\nInput: On an aeroplane trip, a passenger will be served food or a beverage for which of these parts of their anatomy(spelling)?

{"text": "Bob had a one mile headstart and will be caught in 45 minutes.\n\n### Explanation:\nBecause Bob had a one-mile headstart, Jim will catch Bob in 6 * 1 + 1 minutes = 6 + 1 minutes = (7) minutes. 7 minutes passed, which means for 7 miles, or 4.34 miles/minute, Jim will have covered the 1 mile that Bob had headstarted earlier. However, Bob has now run (4.34 miles * 6) * 60 seconds / mile in the 6 * 1 minutes because Bob was running 6 miles per hour for these 6 minutes, so Bob has covered a distance of (4.34 * 42) + 6 (the 6 minutes of the headstart) so Bob has covered a total of 318 miles.\n45 minutes later, Jim will have run (22 * 1/6) miles = 11.66666... miles.\n42 miles * 60 seconds/mile = 2520 minutes (42 * 60)\n11.667 * 2520 = 29.229, thus 45 minutes later or 45 * 60 seconds = (2700) seconds after the headstart, Jim would have reached Bob at the 318-mile mark.\n\n### Summary\nWe need to look at all three clauses, but not worry about the order of answers.

However, the question is about an \"e-sport tournament\" which implies a 2v2 competition.\n\nIf we assume that \"Player 1\" means \"Team 1\", then E-Sports involve teams of competitors, as seen in this example:\n\n<aside class=\"highlight\" lang=\"javascript\">\n<pre data-trim class=\"hljs\">\n/* A simple E-Sports example */\nconst E_SPORTS_GAME = \"Fortnite\";\n\nvar player = {\n    player1: {\n\t\tname: \"Team 1\",\n\t\tmatchesWon: 2,\n\t\tmatchesLost: 5\n\t  \t},\n    player2: {\n\t\tteamName: \"Team 2\",\n\t\tmatches Won: 0,\n\t\tmatches Lost:-\n\t\t},\n   ....\n}\n</pre>\n</aside>\n\nSo, E represents the second team, and D represents the fourth player/team of the tournament.

What is the most important thing the question wants us to understand?\n* How tall are Betty and her dad?\nWe are looking for an answer saying 'three times' because 'twice twice as tall as her dad' and 'Betty has 3 times the height of mom'. \nHowever, the actual amount of 'tall' will be the same for both Betty and her dad - 3 times tall, NOT three times taller. Therefore  we are looking for the answer saying 'three as tall'.\nSince it asks about how many times taller = how tall. A and B say: twice and three times, respectively. \nTherefore the answer is either B or C. We know that B is the answer because it best aligns with other answer choices.\nWe know that Betty was told that she is twice as tall as her mother. To explain this, Betty needs to say that 'her mom is two times as tall as her daddy'. This 'and' is equivalent to 'because'.\nWe know that her mom is two times as taller as her daddy.\nTo answer the question, Betty needs two things:\n* How tall is her mom?\n* How tall is daddy?\nWe know that Betty's mom is two times as high as her mom's mom (2T = 2X", "answer": " 22"}

So we have 5(22) - 22 = 9 5(9) - 5 = 18 9+18+22 = 49. So we divide 5 times Josh or Anna\u2019s 22 by 5 14.   Thus Anna's age is 14 years.                                               |\n\n### Rationales: \n\n1. The question has two parts. First, they ask the current age for Josh and Anna. As they both are turning 50 and they are celebrating 30th birthday anniversary, we can conclud that Josh and Anna\u2019s current age is 50 years combined. (Josh:50,Anna:50).\n\n2. From the second question, we need to find Anna\u2019s age. It asks us to determine her age only by the fact that when they married Josh age is 22 and today they celebrated 30 anniversary which is 5 times that Josh age at time they married, so the combined age for Josh and Anna is 50 + 50 and the result is 22 + 30 and the answer is 52. To determine Anna's age we divide 5 times that number (22 times 5 = 110) by 5 and this is 22 as we obtained in the question from combined age of Josh and Anna. So Anna's age is (22 \u00f7 5). 22 \u00f7 7 is 3.14278. So Anna's Age is 31.4278.", "answer": " 28"}

So half of 60 is 30. Thus the final number of trees would be 60+30=90.\nThen add the coconuts to the mangoes, Randy has 5 less than that. Hence, 95 trees.\n### Input:The school has a population of 305. 20% are girls. Which is a closer estimate to the number of girls in the school: 27, or 30?\n\n### Examination:\nFirst, we have to find the number of boys in the school. 305 + 39 girls (20% of 305) = 344 boys.\nNext, we can work backwards to solve for the number of girls.\n30% of boys' number + 7% of girls' number + 30% of girls' number = 100. From this, we know that the number of girls + 7% of boys = 100 and 29% of girls = 30 of boys.\nTo find the answer, simply multiply 30 by 100 to get 3000 or divide 3000 by 30 to get 100.

{"text": "(Total number of stamps Bella bought= B+(11-9).(13-0))\n\n#### Methodology\nIt is important to understand which set of the three is the smallest or the greatest. Since the stamps in the first set were purchased at the post office, the smallest set is that of the post office. As there were 11 of those and 9 more trucks bought than snowflakes. (11=9). This means that Bella bought 1 fewer truck stamp than snowflake stamp. However, Bella bought 13 fewer rose than truck stamp, so the total number of stamps that Bella purchased is 1(Snowflake) - (trucks-snowflake) + 13(rose) - (Rose \u2013 trucks) = 11 +1(9) +13(1) - (13(5) - 13(2)) = (70-26). Therefore, the correct answer is stamps = 44\n\n1. As there were 9 more truck stamp than snow flake stamp, if bought 11 snow flake stamp, the total number of truck stamp and rose stamp should be 1 lesser than the number of rose.\n2. 44 stamps means there are equal number of truck and rose stamp.\n3. When there is equal number of rose and truck stamp, there should be 13 rose stamp purchased per truck stamp.\nAnswer: Bella bought 70 stamps in all.", "answer": " 38"}

{"text": "In this case, James has $1000 available to split between his four expenses: food, accommodation, entertainment, and coursework materials. Since the question only asks for the amount spent on coursework materials, we need to subtract the value of the other expenses from $1000 in order to determine this.\n\nFrom the statement, we know that James spends $350 on coursework materials. \n\nLet's first calculate how much he spends on each of the other categories, and then subtract that from $100 to get the answer.\n\n| Expense | Percentage of budget spent | Amount spent | \n| :--- | :--- | :---: |\n| Food | 30% | $300 | \n| Accommodation | 15% | $150 | \n| Entertainment | 25% | $250 | \n\nSubtract $300+$150+$250 from $100=100, we get 70. We can say that James spend 70 dollars on Entertainment and 30 dollars on Food.\n\nSince we know that coursework materials cost $350, this means 70+30 are expenses that cost a total of $100, which means 70+20+30= $120 is left over.\n\nNow we can know that James spend $120 on Entertainment and $20 on Food.\n\nAnswer: $350\n\n\n### Instructions:Answer the following question.\n\n## Instruction:Answer the question using a complete sentence that includes subject, predicate, and object.\n\nInput: The answer was \"C\": 1.2 liters of salt for 25 liters of water.\n\nOutput:  1.2 liters\n\n### Instrumentation:\n\n - Python 3.7\n  - Spyder IDE\n\n - Pandas\n  - Matplotlib\n  - Seaborn\n\n - SQL\n\n - LaTeX\n  - PyCharm\n  - Jupyter\n  - Microsoft Visual Studio Code\n  - VS Code\n\n### Instructor Resources:\n[Writing a Solution](https://github.com/Spencer", "answer": " 300"}

That meant the sum of \"cucumbers\" would be _______ fewer, and \"peppers\" would have a sum of _____ more.\n\n### Rationales:We start with the first step where we identify that cucumbers had _______ fewer potatoes than potatoes. This tells us that the number will increase by the difference between the two numbers. The same logic can be applied to peppers, which had _______ more cucumbers than cucumbers. This gives us two equations that need to be solved.\n\n### For example,\n\n### We can now see that we need to add the two numbers together for the number of vegetables that they produced.\n  \n### Then we see that we need to solve for X to get the total number of vegetables.\n### We have one other data point, however, and need to be cautious in choosing which one to solve for.

Which orange, pear, and apple combination gives the greatest discount compared to the average cost of the 2 or 3 fruits?\n\n### Rationale:\n\nThe first part gives the prices of the three fruits and tells us that the greater the number of products, the greater the discount that comes from the higher price. We know that the pear is one dollar more than the orange, which is fifty cents more than the apple. If the number of products goes from 2 to 3, the difference in prices between the fruits, according to the question, will also go from 1 to 50 cents. This implies that, in order to get the greatest discount, we should take three fruit whose prices total 50 cents less than the average of the three prices. Which means that the price of the apple should be half of the average of the two prices, or 40 cents each for the apple and pear.\n\n### Rules for the calculation:\nThe last 3 or 4 sentences of the passage give the math rule used for the calculation.

This number then should be added to 90 portrats so it will be 99. \n6. 99 x 2 = 198, and 198/3 is 66, so: 66 * 2 = 132, but this is the cost of all 3 days, meaning it should be 264.\n7. We can conclude that: 264 = (15 * cost 16 inch) + (9 * cost 8 inch) + 48(cost of 16 inch and 8 inch combined)\n8. This equation gives us 136, and since each day's profit from 8 is 8 then 8 multiplied by 3 is 24. 264-264/3= 87 which is $28.93.\n\n### Summary:", "answer": " 195"}

{"text": "She needs to read 16920 pages in total.\n### Rationale:  \nFor each pair of months, she reads 4/20 = 20% of the pages in that month. After reading four books in a month, she read 4/4 = 100% or 1 book for the rest of month. Over 2 months, she will have read 4/20 * 2 = 80% of the pages. So she has to read 20% * 80% = 16000+ pages. So, she has to read 16160 pages in total. \nAnswer: 0.08% 0. The ratio of a person's blood to their entire body is about 0.08%. The percentage of water in a person's blood is about 0.9%, and the percentage of fat in a person's body is about 10-13%. Thus, the entire blood of a person's body represents approximately 0.08*0.9 = 8% of their entire body weight, or 8% of 154 lbs is about 12.33 lbs.\n\n### Output: 10%. 10% of 70 is about 7.\n\n### Rationale::\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between the numbers.

But, the boy used exactly 6 cards out of the 200 per each box, which meant we have to subtract the.6 amount per each box. $124-(1.64*$200) = $54.46.\n\n### Input\nThe teacher will give the students a quiz on math that includes the following questions.

Therefore, a player who backs down first, shows a great level of cowardice, whereas a player who continues, has high bravery. Hence, the player who backs down is least likely to win, which makes him/her most likely to back down. \n\n### Input : You want to work with a team of 8 or 9 people.  When you do a team of 8, you pay all people 8% of your salary as a bonus.  When you do the team of 9 you pay all people 9% of your salary.  You aren't very fond of your boss but need some money.  How much more do you get if you take the team of 9 to a total of $2000 if you make $200,000.  Assume that the bonus always totals $1600.\n\n### Choice:B\n\n### Explanation:If the team size is 9, the team bonus is 9%, so for the company's salary of $200, $ 18 is bonus paid to everyone. If the team size is 8, the team bonus is $ 8 or $ 2.4 per employee (total of bonus is $1600). If you take the team of nine, you take home the difference which is 2.4-2.4 (or $50 per employee) instead of $0.  Therefore, the amount gained is B.", "answer": " 650"}

{"text": "Chelsea has 3 bags with 24 kilos each. If one bag is torn and half of the contents fall to the ground that leaves 9 kilos. \n\nRationales: In the first line, the sentence is explaining that Chelsea has 4 bags, but does not specify how much sugar each bag has. To answer this question, we need to divide the amount of sugar in the four bags by the number of bags, since each bag should have an equal amount of sugar. \n\nThe question gives a number (24) and a sum (4 bags), so the equation for this is 24 \u00f7 4 = 6kg of sugar each per bag. \n\nIn the second line, one of the bags is torn and half is lost, meaning that half of the 9 kilos of sugar remaining after being divided by 4 bags is lost. \n\nSince 9 \u00f7 4 =? kg. \n\nAfter being divided by four bags, 9 kg = 2.25 kg divided by 4, meaning that only 2 bags remain. \n\nSince there were originally 24 kilos, we have 6 kg of sugar in 1 bag and 0 kg of sugar in 3 bags. Thus, the answer is that there are only 2 bags remaining, and 2.25 kilos less than 1 bag of sugar.\n\nAnswer: \n-There were 24 kilos in the four bags to begin with.\n-After the one bag gets ripped, there are 9 kilos left (the amount that fell to the ground)\n-Of these 9 kilos left, half of it get torn, leaving 4.5 kilos.\n\nAnswer: There are only two bags left with 2.175 kg of sugar each.\nAnswer.docx", "answer": " 21"}

{"text": "Input: The selling price of a bike.  The bicycle had sold for 220 last year. The bicycle was marked up 15%.\n\nWe will use a method called the method called 'Markup Over Price' to get the sale price.\nWe will look at the profit gained on the old price. If it is marked up by 15%, then you take the new amount and minus the old one. It is:\n\nMarkup Over Profit = 100(New) - 100(Old)\n\nFor example, if the new price is $20, then the mark up over profit will be:\n```\n100(20) - 10(220) = $40\n```\n\nNow $40 is the extra profit gained on the original price of $220.\n\nIf the price increased is $220 x 1.15 or 1.1500 you will get:\n```\n1.150(220.00) - 1.15(220.15) = $40.79 in profit\n```\nNotice the number to the right of the decimal point.

{"text": "Answer the question on page 36, step 10.\n\n### Rationale:Input: James, the high scorer at quiz bowl, got 7 points in his first game and lost in the semifinals of the state competition by only 1 point, How many points did he give up in a playoff game in the semifinals?\nRationales: For starters, we can eliminate all the options, as they don't make any sense when we refer back to the question asked on page 11. \n\n1. First of all, in the sentence, it says that James got an overall score of \"7 points\", but the options all show 44 and 45. It can't be 45, because if he only lost by 1 point, then there would be more than that many points that made the difference, so it must be 44. \n2. \"59 points\" doesn't make sense, because he would have lost by more than 1 point and that would have been an impossible score for him to beat in a head to head playoff. \n3. \"64 points\" also doesn't make sense due to the fact that you can only give up 59 points, since, as mentioned before, you lose if you give up more than that in your total give-away.\n\nSo, out of the choices, only 44 is correct. \nAnswer: 44\n\n### Input:\"What is 15% of 15?\n\n### Demostration:\"One must have a working knowledge of percentages to be able to do percent calculations in mathematics. 15 percent is 15 divided by 100, which equals 0.15.

{"text": "Tina made $120 if she sold 24 books and $120 profit if she sold 12 books. Therefore, if she was making $120, she had to sell 24 copies of the book. Each book she sold was at a loss, however, because she made $100 profit and she sold 12 copies. For each book she sold, she lost $5. Therefore, the minimum number of books she sold was 6.

Choices: A: Less b: Less or more c: More or less d: Same e: Less or equal f: More or equal g: Less\nRationales: Solution: Let number of apples be y. Decreasing has two possiblities. It could be \"more\" (x<y), or \"less\" (x>y) \n\t\t\tSo, we know that, y must have opposite trend to \"less\". If it's less, then number of apples must increase to get a result of \"less\".\nIf x<y, then y is 2, and x will be 3, 4 and 5. This is because y + 1=x+1 and x+2=y+2 and x+3=y+3 and  x+4=y+4. Therefore, since x increases to the value of y, x must be <= 2, y = 2, y is decreasing. \nIf x>y, then y is decreasing too, which is not a possibility. But, in that case, y can either be decreasing or increasing. If it's decreasing, then number of apppeals must decrease to get a result of y.\nIf it's increasing", "answer": " 8"}

{"text": "Lydia will be 16 when she gets to eat the apple from her tree.\n\n### Explanation: There are two pieces of information in this question:\n\n1. It takes 7-8 (since 2x3=6 and 2+3=5) years for an apple tree from the time it is planted to produce its first fruits. This means Lydia can expect her tree's first apple to come around when she turns 12 or 13 or 14 (8 years from the time Lydia planted her tree).\n\n2. Lydia, now 9 years old when given the question, planted her tree when she was 1 years old. Taking into account the life cycle of apple trees, Lydia would need 7-8 (2-year gap) years before she can expect to enjoy the first fruit from her tree. From the given information, Lydia will need to wait a whole 1 or 2 years to get a bite of the fruit.\n\n### Input 2:\n```Math\nWhat is the weight of this cat?\n[A] 5kg\n[B] 2kg\n[C] 8kg\n[D] 20kg\n```\n\n### Expectation: The expected answer is A.\n\n### Rationales:\n1.

(A minute is how much time it takes to answer yes or no.)\n\nIt is a time frame that you need to find out what the weather prediction is so you'll know. \n\n### How is the phrase \"2 hour\" warning used in a sentence to refer to events predicted", "answer": " 5"}

Choices:  a: water b: fire c: ice d: electricity e: light\nRationales:Step 1: \"In every country..\" implies that we are looking into what a common belief of each country is. \nStep 2: Examples A: \"water\" and B: \"light\" could be considered global and shared among most nations, but may be too generic as they only refer to water and light.\nStep 3. \"Fire\" might be considered global, in that it is not unique, but it is not found in every country and would be a poor fit for this question.\nStep 4. \"Ice\" would not likely be shared by every nation and is not suitable as an answer for this question.\n\nStep 5: \"Electricity\" would be a popular shared belief throughout the world, but this question refers to a more general, fundamental belief that is shared among all people, rather than a more specific one related to technology or infrastructure.\n\nStep 6. \"Electricity\", \"electricity\", \"fire\", \"water\", \"lightening\", and \"sunlight\" all indicate something that is associated with sun. In essence, they're not related to the \"people\" mentioned in the question. Since the question refers specifically to people, these choices are not a good fit.\nStep 7: \"Electric\" and \"light\" is also a potential choice. However, it does not entirely meet our criteria for the question being related to people. The options may refer to light sources, but they are not necessarily associated with people. \"Electric\" can pertain to a light source while \"light\" simply means light. \n\nStep 8: Therefore, the only choice that satisfies the criteria is \"people\" as described in the question. Thus, the correct answer to our \"In every country, there is something that people believe is.......\". is \"people\".\nStep 9: Conclusion: The answer should be \"people\"\n\nAnswer: A: People\n\n### Instructions: Complete the story.

Therefore, John was given $ 7 as donations.\n\nJohn was given $ 7.

The lock consists of two metal bars, which are pressed together.  If the bars are placed parallel to the opening, we can open it.  Is it possible that the lock was set up wrong? Choices: A: Impossible B: Unlikely C: Likely D: Unknown E: Yes\nRationales:1. The question is to identify if the locked box may be possible to open. It mentions the lock as being 'wrong', so we need to determine if it's impossible or not.\n2. Answer choice A: 'Implausible' states that it is not likely, which is not what we are looking for since the answer is either 'Impossible' or 'Not impossible'. \n3. Answer choice B: 'Likely' is incorrect as well because it implies that it \"may well be the case that the lock has been set up wrong\", but this is not what we want since the question asks if it is \"possible\" and only the answer 'Not impossible' can satisfy a potential outcome.  \n4. Therefore, the only options left are A: Impossible and B: Unlikely. However, since 'Unlikely' describes the condition as being \"less likely\" and 'Impossible' is the polar opposite (\"incredibly difficult and hence improbable\"), 'Impossible' is still incorrect. \n5. Only by considering Answer Choice A: 'Impossible' as the possible scenario, the question becomes plausible.\n6.

We can simplify it to 4000 \u00f7 10 = 400.\n\n### Justification:A parking lot is defined as a long area of ground where you can park your car. A large parking lot is made up of smaller spots where you can do that, so the cars need to be located in these small spaces. This question states that James paves a lot that is 400 Ft \u00d7 500 Ft. Ft is the shorten version of feet, so we can write it as 4000 Ft \u00d7\n\n2. Multiplying gives us 4000 \u00d7 2 = 8000 ft square. However, 80% of this can't be used which means we will only be able to use 800 ft \u00d7 2 = 1600 ft square.\n\nLet's simplify the 1600 using the equation 1600 \u00f7 2 = 8. So, what we can determine is that 8 ft \u00d7 2 =16 ft. Since 16 ft is not a whole number, this is 16 \u00f7 2 =\n\n8 ft.\n\nIn the question, it is stated that it takes 10 ft2 to park a car, so to park a car we take 10 ft2 \u00d7 number of cars.", "answer": " 16000"}

Bianca worked 12.5 hr.\n3. The word \"twice\" can be read as having a multiplicative value of 2, as a mathematical term (i.e. 2 * b) with a unit of the hours.\n4. Hence \"twice that\" = 2 * (12.5) hr or 25 hr for Biance and Cecleste.\n\n5. For McClain, \"8.5 hr less\" can be considered individually to understand the quantity of time McClain was absent.\n6. The statement \"8.5 hr(less) = 8 hr(absent)\" can be used for the calculations.\n7. McClain= 25 - 8 * 2 = 17\n\n1. To find Celeste's time, we will multiply x by 2 and the sum all together. x was 25, thus, x*2 = 50.\n2. \"for x and Celesete worked for 25(x)and 50(Celeste)\" =\n3. Thus,\n4. \"x+Celeste=121.5\"\n5.

{"text": "Georgia has 25 pieces less than Lorene.\n\n### Rationales: 1) Georgia has 25 less stationery than Lorene.\n2) If \"stationery\" is ambiguous and refers to both paper and pencils, then Georgia has fewer pieces of \"stationery\", since there's 24 pieces of paper and one pencil, making Lorene's stationery count as 74 pieces, and Georgia's as 51 pieces.\n\n### Input 2: In a movie, a character has 8 lines. How many lines did this character have in the previous scenes?\n\n### Instructions: Subtract the line counts for the current scene.\n\n### Response 1: This character had 7 lines in the previous scenes.\n\n### Explaination: \n\n1) The current scene has 8 lines, so the subtraction is 8 - 8 = 0.\n2) The previous scene has 7 lines, so the subraction is 7 - 7 = 0.\n\n### Another solution: \n\n1. In a movie, one character has 8 lines in one scene, so the character must have 8 lines in the previous scenes as well. (Line count does not go down.)\n2. If 8 lines in one previous scene and 7 lines in the next previous scenes are required, this means the previous scenes must contain 15 lines.\n3. The total line count of 7 in the 9th-6th scenes plus 15 in the 10th-5th scenes equals 22 lines.\n4. Since there are 8 in the current scene, subtracting 7 from 8 leaves 1 line. This does not carry the story (i.e. it does not make sense); if subtracting 7 from the line count makes 8 less than the line count of the current scene, the process will need to be undone: this can be done by adding 8 back to the amount of lines, which is obtained by subtracting 5 (current line count - 8 to be subtracted) from 8.", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "37 Minutes.\n\n### Rationale: For homework, Tina will take 10 minutes. Dinner will take her 37 minutes.\n\n### Input #2: Tina is working on her school assignment, but her laptop is having some technical problems. Some of the keys on her laptop keyboard are sticky and she cannot press them. To solve the problem, Tina notices that she'll need to clean her computer keyboard. Her assignment should only take 10 to 15 minutes, so she needs to time herself to see if she has the time to clean her computer keyboard first. She starts by cleaning one key, which takes 3 minutes. After cleaning one key, there are now 14 left to do. How long does it take to clean both the keys and get her assignment done?\n\n### Rationales:\nInput:\n1. The question asks us to determine how long it takes to clean the remaining 14 keys. So, all we need to focus on is noting how long it takes for Tina to clean each key. Once we've noted how long it takes to complete this task, then multiply that by 14, and this will give us how long it will take to clean Tina's entire keyboard.\n2. Let us assume that cleaning a key takes 3 minutes, then multiplying that by 14 will take 3 minutes. Hence, it will take 3 minutes for Tina to clean both her computer keyboard and complete her assignment.\n\nOutput:\n3. We will use 0.5 to represent 30 seconds, which is 10 minutes divided by 60.\n4. We multiply 0.5 by 15 to get 7.5 minutes. This is our answer to the problem.\n\n### Note:\n\nTina's work is divided into 2 main tasks, 1. Cleaning her computer keyboard, and 2. Completing her school assignment. Thus the time Tina takes to clean her computer keyboard can be noted separately from Tina completing her school assignment. We can also note that cleaning a key on her keyboard takes 3 minutes. Thus we get that for her school assignment, Tina needs to take 10 minutes (the total 20 minutes divided by 2). The entire task can then be broken down as follows", "answer": " 52"}

Harris will go to carrot shop every 1 week 104/52 X 2.00 = $81\n5. Therefore every year Harris spends $81 on carrots\n\n### Input :The woman is playing cards with the men.  There are 4 people and each round she gets 5 cards from what? Choices: A: man's clothing B: baggy pants C: pocket D: hand E: wallet\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The question asks us to find out what the woman draws cards from.\n2. We observe that there are 4 people, and every round the woman draws 5 cards from one person. \n3. This suggests one person needs to provide her with 5 cards every round. \n4. Looking at her options 1) She doesn't have a baggy pants 2) She doesn't necessarily have the man's shirt or baggy pants on. So, she can't be A: man's shirt and B: baggy pant.\n5. Option C: pocket doesn't make sense because pockets are on clothing not people. Similarly, D, hand doesn't make sense either, as hands are on people.\n6. Only option E: wallet makes sense, because a wallet is usually on a person, and holds many cards. \n7. Thus E: wallet is the correct answer because it is the only option that makes sense.\nAnswer: E. Wallet\n\n### Input :-  The students were writing their letters to mom.  There are 14 students in the classroom and the students each have  only ___ letters.

{"text": "Answer is 45\n\n### Explanation:There is some mathematical language in this problem. Let's walk through the solution.\n\nTo write this as a mathematical formula:\n\nNumber of tadpoles caught = (N=180)\n\nNumber of tads released (t/n =.75)\n\nTo solve for the remaining tadpoles:\n\n180 +.75N =.75N\n\nSolve for N:\n\nN = 45 (rounded to nearest integer)\n\nIt is important to note that 180 does not equal N. To find that answer, we must first subtract the ones released (75/100). Then, we can subtract the ones released from 180, and finally add.75N = 45.\n\nThis leads us to the conclusion that the number of tads that Trent caught is 45.  (180 + 75 = 255, and 255 - 75 = 75; 75 + 45 = 120, and 120 +.75 = 135.75)\n\nAnswer: 45", "answer": " 45"}
{"text": "This question is asking how much Edric makes in an hour. It requires us to use his salary (his yearly income divided by 12, which is $576). This is found under'monthly' in the question. We need to then divide the number 576 by the number of hours he works, which is 8*6, and multiply that by 365 because that is the number of days in a year. 576/1440*365=30, so his hourly rate is $30 per hour.\n\n### Response 2:\nThis question is pretty simple, you just need to look at the question and pick the answer that best fits. If we look at the question, we can see an extra piece of relevant information that we can use to help us figure out what the answer will be. We know that the question is asking for the hourly rate, and the phrase 'how much is his hourly' implies that we will use hours that he works and divide by hours in a year. In this question, Edric works 6 days a week and he works 8 hours, so we can assume that we will divide 6 days a week by 2 (the number of weeks in a year). When I'm taking tests where they ask for what a math operation, such as division or subtraction, will give the answer to the question, I usually answer without plugging in any numbers until I have to. For division, a common strategy is to first add the number you're dividing into and then subtract it from the number that you're dividing it from. Because we are dividing work by hours and I know I'll need to divide by 365 later. we can assume that (8 hours)*6 days=48 hours (rounding up from 48 hours to 50 hours since 8 hours a day was the number), and 50/(365 days)=0.137. So Edric makes around $0.13 an hour. The best answer choice for this question is D.\n\n### Input 3:\nThe first step to take when looking at this question is to look for the key phrases to help us figure out the correct answer.

{"text": "How many apples did Buff steal from Carla?(A) 34 (B) 33(C) 15(D) 31\n\n### Rationales:\nWe can see that 26 apples were taken away from Carla. And we know that Carla has 79 apples total, but after subtracting the 26 apples, she is left with 53 apples. But not only do we have 26 fewer apples, we know that Carla took out 26 apples to feed the school, so we are left with _ fewer apples than we started with. So we are dealing with an equation that can be written in this way:\n$$\\begin{align*}\n79-26-x=\\begin{cases} 53 & \\text{(A)}\\\\ 29 & \\text{(B)}\\\\ 8 & \\text{(C,D)} \\end{cases}\n\\end{align*}$$\n\nIf we work out the values for each of the choices, we find that\n\nAnswer: Carla was given 79 apples to begin with, and then 26 apples of those were taken away to feed the school, leaving Carla with 53 appLES to begin with (case A). To make a backpack full and to eat, Carla needed to put as many apples in as she would eat lunch. Thus, it's logical to conclude that Carla added 53 apples to fill her backpack.\n\nFrom there, Buffy was given 68 apples to begin with. He started with 68 apples. Buffy took out 26 of those apples to feed the rest of the class (case B). We can say Buffy's total is 42 now. Since Carla ate one apple per day (79+26-1=79), and 26 appLES were taken to feed the rest, Carla ate 53 apples each day (case A). Buffy can't eat 53 apples per day because that means he was left with an impossibly high number of left over apples every day and no way to eat them (case B).

{"text": "Angie bought two times as many pretzellas Barry. Shelly bought one fifth of Barry pretzels. Therefore Angie bought sixteen pretzels, three times more than Barry.\n\n### Rationale: To approach this, start by reading each choice slowly and checking if any of them could possibly fit. In line 1, Angie bought three times as much as Shelly bought. This suggests that Shelley bought two times as much as Angie bought. So, subtracting two from the number Angie bought will mean Shelley bought one sixth of what Angie bought. In line 2, Angie bought, one thirty seventh of what Barry bought. To be more precise, that will mean Barry bought three quarters. That's 100+33.4 = 133.4 133.5. Therefore, in line 2, Shelly bought three times less than that number. We can say that Angie bought half of what Barry bought because she bought four pretzels for every two that he bought.\n\n### Now, when the answer was being looked for, Angie bought sixteen, three times what Barry bought. The question asks how many pretzels did Billy bought. If we apply what we did in the line 2, we must go by the number of pretzels that Angie bought (16). And one third of that is three pretzels. Therefore, it was Barry who bought 12 pretzel. \n\n### Choice E: Barry bought ten pretzels. However, Angie bought two times Barry. That's 2\u00d710. 14. However, according to line 2, Angies bought two times as much pretzels as Barry bought. That means Barry bought one eighteenth of what she bought. In that case, it makes no sense for Angie to buy twelve pretzels, which is not a multiple of three and not a multiple of five.

For every 5 mi, it drives 2 minutes, so Yolanda's car will go this distance in 4 minutes.\n\n### Note: It doesn't matter how long Yolanda takes to ride her bike: this gives us a lower bound on how long the car will take to drive the entire distance (4 miles in 4 minutes). Because Yolanda has to wait for the car to drive 40 miles, the car will always have more time than Yolanda to make it to her location. Even if Yolanda rides at a very slow speed (e.g 2 mph), the car still has a longer time per mile to travel, and ends up catching her in less than 35 minutes for the entire distance.\n\n### Subject:Rationales\n\n### Instructions:\n\n### Demostration:\n\n### Instuction:Answer the following math question.\n\n\n### Demosntration:\n\n## Answer:\n\n### Answer:\n\n## Instruction:Answer the questions below.\n\n## Rationale:\n\n## Input:13.

{"text": "If Tom could increase his reading speed, he would be able to read\n2 (pages per hour)(3)(pages per hour)\n4 pages\n\n### Rationales:1. We know from the problem that it takes Tom one hour to read 12 pages.\n2. We also know that if Tom could increase his reading rate by a factor of 2, then he would be able to do 12 pages a hour instead of 1 page a hour as he does right now. Because he reads at the same rate, that's double his original one hour.\n3. To solve this equation, just multiply the two factors together. We get 3 pages per hour.\n4. So, he could read 22 pages in two hours.\n5. To multiply a factor multiplied by another factor, we multiply (factor(factor)). So (3)(2(pages per hour)) is 3(2)(pages per hour). That means a factor of 3 times itself 2 times, which yields 4 pages per hour.\nAnswer: 4 pages per hour\n\nInput: If the price you can pay for a ticket is one-tenth the price of a first-class ticket, then what is the minimum price for a second-class ticket?

He goes there 4 times per month and spends 2 dollars per month.\n\nThe question then asks how much money in 'dollars' Randy had left if he made 4 monthly trips to store and needed to spend 2 dollars at each.\n\nTo answer the question, we need to follow the following steps:\n\n1.

{"text": "It will take 5.25 hours to complete the entire set  of laundry? Choices: \nA: 40.33 B: 43.66 C: 46.81 D: 47.25 E: 48.09\n\n### Rationales:\n\nStep 1: The question asks for the time it takes to complete the entire set.\nStep 2. Look at each choice:\n  A  B  C  D  E\n   +  + + + -\n  We do not need to add since all choices are in the same range (45-60 minutes).\n  Similarly, we do not need to subtract since all choices are in same range (1-2 hours).\n  Hence add and substract don't matter in this scenario. We are looking for the answer in which we can get the number of loads from the time taken to complete the laundry.\n\nStep 3: Looking at one load of laundry, we can see that there are 2 different cycles with different time and also some amount of time between each cycle.\nStep 4. We can identify what amount of time is needed to end the cycle by looking at the number of loads and multiplying by the time needed to complete one cycle. The amount of time needed in the cycle ends up becoming the amount of time taken in one load. For instance, If a total of 8 loads of laudry are needed and each load takes 45 minutes, then the amount of time to finish a cycle ends up becoming, 45 minutes (45x1) = 45 minutes or a total of 45 minutes.\n\nStep 5. So if there are 8 loads of washable cloth, each load takes 40 minutes, then the amount needed in the cycle is the multiplier. For instance, if 45 minutes (30 minutes + 15) is needed for 8 loads in the cycle, then the total needed time for one cycle is 40 (40 x 8).\n\nStep 6. If there are 22 loads of washable clothes, each load takes 35 minutes and there is a gap of 5 minutes between each cycle, the number that is multiplied becomes 22 x 40 + 5. In this case", "answer": " 14"}

There are four choices: A: 4, B: 8, C: 16, D: 32\n\n### Rationales:\n\n1. The size of the full garden is 64. The garden can be split into two different ways: 50/50, two distinct rectangles, or with a quarter taken up by fruit, and the other three quarters being split into equal sections (50/5/3/2).\n2. Based on the rules that Joel gives, half of the fruit is 16 ft. The garden can be divided into the following with 16 being equal to a quarter of the fruit: A: Quarter of the fruit section (50/5); B: 32 - 16 = 16 = 25%; C: 4 - 8 = 4 = 16 = Quarter of the fruit (50/4), which leaves 4.\n3. If Joel were to take a quarter out of the fruit section, then he would be left with one quarter of the fruit remaining, which is 4.\n4. We can conclude that the answer is A: The garden can be split, taking a quarter of the fruit, and leaving 4 remaining.\n5.

{"text": "She has 33 more blue shirts left.\n\n### Explain: Given the statement, \"If she gives away half of..., and a third of..\", it is clear that the question refers to the situation of giving away shirts.\n\nThe key to understanding the question is to calculate the number of shirts left after the giving away.\n\nLet's take it one step at a time.\n\nWe start with the initial number of blue and brown shirts: 26 blue and 36 brown.\n\nNext, we'll determine how much is given away for each kind of shirt. We know that half of the blue shirts and third of the brown shirts are given away. Therefore, we'll calculate how much of each kind is given away.\n\nTo figure out the total amount of the blue shir ts removed, we take half of the total amount of all the shirts (26 + 36 = 62) which is 31.\n\nTo figure how much of the brown shir t is given away, we take a third of the total amount of the brown shir ts (36 = 54) which is 19.\n\nHence, 31 blue shirts are given and 19 brown shirts are removed, leaving 76 shirts left. \n\nWe have now calculated how many shirts are removed.\n\nNow, we have to determine how many shirts remain. We know that the total removed is 31 blue sh irts and 19 brown and we have 76 remaining shirts. The total of the blue and brown shir ts removed after the giving away should equal the total number of remaining shirts.\n31 + 19 = 50 blue shirt s left.\nHence, 50 - 32 = 18 blue and brown shir t left.\n\n## Recipies:\n\n### Instrucion: Describe why one type of carbohydrate is more efficient at sustaining energy in the body than another.\n\n### Recipie: I'd bet my dish on carbs!

Similarly, the cost of cream cheese would be multiplied by the amount of cream cheese to obtain the cost of cream. Lastly, the cost of cold cuts would be multiplied by 2 to find the total cost of meat. Add all these total costs together, and we have a total cost of ingredients of $54 + $10 + $72 = $136. Therefore, we have a final cost of $136 in ingredients.\n\n### Input :\nThe sentence reads: \"Marmots can be found higher up in the mountains. They have paws that allow them to climb what higher areas?\"\n\n### Response  :\nThe answer is not in the question! Look at the question more carefully. You will notice two words that need to be combined to make a sentence, \"higher\" and \"areas\". These words can be combined to form a sentence that reads \"higher areas\". Therefore, the answer is \"A: higher areas\".\n\n### Input  :\nWhat time do we see in an international city?\n\n### Rationales  : \nOption 1: \"A: time\" - The choice \"time\" does not refer to a certain time of day in a location, but rather the general concept of time in general. For example, we could see the clock in a foreign city at various times, indicating that multiple options are possible.\n\nOption 2: \"B: hours\" - This choice refers to the span of time that elapses in a specific set time period, such as \"6:30 - 7:00 hours\" or \"11:00 - 13:40 hours\". While it could be argued that the units measured within a specific time frame are called \"hours\", it does not make sense to refer to time by the term \"hours\".\n\nOption 3: \"C: minutes\" - This choice refers only to the time that elapses while someone's watch counts down. It is a particular period within the whole of time, which can also be measured in other units, such as \"hundred years\" or \"a lifetime\".\n\nOption", "answer": " 35"}

{"text": "He didn't hit 140 of the 175 balls.\n\n### Explanation:Let \"I\" represent the number of times Ralph succeeded.Ralph\u2019s success rate for any ball that he swings at is equal to \u201cI.\u201d \n\nHence, \"I\" is how many times Ralph succeeded from a random collection of 175 balls\n\nBecause of probability, there are two ways to think about what the probability of Ralph hitting a second ball is:\n1.  As the probability of hitting a ball out of a random collection of N ball, it is equal to.\n2.  The probability of hitting any of a random collection of n balls is nP.\nIn this case, \"n\" is 175, and \"I\" is the number of times that Ralph successfully hit a ball from the 175.\n\nFrom 1, the probability of Ralph successfully hitting a ball is:.\n\nFrom 2, that same probability is\n175nI\nHis success rate is n, and the number of times he managed it is I, therefore the probability of Ralph hitting that ball is equal to\n\n175I\n\n175/175\n\nI\n\nWe want to find : I.\n\nTherefore n/n, so n, must be 1.\n\nTherefore, \"I\" must be 175\n\nWe know we can find \"I\" by taking the sum of all the \"I\" values we can get.\n\nIf we use I for the number of times we hit a ball in the first 10 balls, our expression would be:\n\n175 * 1/175 * 2 / 175 = 1/17.5\n\nWe know that we can't express \"I\" as a division ( / ), because \"I\" is one less than an integer and a division of two numbers can only be represented as the fraction of the smaller number divided by the larger number.\n\nWe are left with 2/175. As the denominator (175) is bigger than the nominator (2) we know we are looking for 2/17,5\n\nWe can express 2/17 as 1/8.5. Finally\n\nI = 1/8", "answer": " 110"}
{"text": "Ms. Snyder's previous monthly income was $2,400.\n\n### Rationale:\nBoth options C and D reduce the rent and utility percentage. Both options would help her afford rent and utilities, which Ms. Snyders says her salary previously didn't. Option A multiplies the new salary and does not include the old salary which would be needed to use the 40% rule. Option B does not make sense given both options C and D reduce her rent and utilities without changing her monthly income. Option B would lead to more confusion. In Option D the rent and utilities are not given in the same way in both options. Option E can't be used given the rules for Option A through D all change monthly income.

We have one Western novel on the bottom of our book cart after we take out the mystery books, and we have two Western novels on the top section of the book cart.\n\n### The question is asking Nancy to determine how many books are on the book cart when shelving was concluded.\n\n### We do not need to add all the numbers to get the correct answer of \"B\", we can simply subtract. The remaining 6 biographies on the bottom section after shelving 5 Western novels would be equal to 6 - 5 = 1. Because when it says \"half the books\" it leaves out that there were already 5 mystery books on the bottom section that were previously there, so that is not counted. If there were 10 biographies on the book cart, then when Nancy shelved the 5 Western novels, there would be 5 mystery books and only 1 Western novels on the bottom section, and only one Western novel left on the top section. This doesn't fit, so we know that she didn", "answer": " 46"}
{"text": "Answer:\n1. Marcy has 12 tubes of lipstick. She decides to bring 3 tubes with her, which is 1/4 of her supply. There are 2 tubes in each tube. She wants to make sure she never runs out of lipstick so she brings 4 tubes for the 6 people.\n\nThat is 56 tubes with each tube containing 2. 56 x 2 = 112 tubes of gloss.\n2. If she brings 6 tubes for 6 people, each person gets 3 tubes. Therefore 6/6 = 1 which means each person will use 1 tube.\n\nRationales: Marcy decides to only bring one fourth of her supply, or 12 tubes. 6 of them are 6/12 or 5 tubes, since some will be in her bag. 3 are in her bag and 4 are for the party. There are 12/4 so 3 of the 4 tubes that are untouched will be left after the party and one of her will always be in her bag.\n3. Since each tube holds 2 tubes and a tube is taken from each one, the party needs 1 tube of lipstick a piece. Marcy has chosen to provide 7 pieces of lipstick so each person gets 6 tubes of lipsticks in the party.\n4. There are 6 people at the wedding. Marcy doesn't run out of lipsticks from bringing 6 tubes. This means the other 1 tube is a reserve. Each person will only use 1 tube since the party is taking 7 tubes. 6/(3+1) = 1. Each person needs 1 tube to be used at the party.\nAnswer: D is incorrect because you cannot get 4 with 6.\nA is the best response, the other three need some work, see below:\n\n###Instruction: Answer the following question using the provided information.\n\n###Demonstration: \nInput: The painter's explanation for never achieving a perfect portrait was because all people are flawed.\nRationales: All people are flawed.

{"text": "Baez will end up with 26 marbles.\n\n### Rationale: The first step should be to simplify the question by finding the original quantity of marbles that Baez has. By subtracting 20% from the original number of marbles, we can determine that Baez has 20% remaining marbles, and her original number is 150% of her remaining marbles: Baez had 20% marbles, so 150% marbles are 150, her remaining quantity was 50. We can write 150% as: 150/100 = 1 1/2.\nThe original number of marbles Baez has is 25 original + 15 original = 40. Her original number is 40 marbles.\n\nThe next step involves determining the second quantity of marbles Baezes' friend gives her with 40 marbles divided by 21. 40 divided by 21 equals 1.9. Baez's friend gives her two additional marbles.\nTherefore, her final quantity is 1 + 2, or 3.\n\nThe final calculation is done by multiplying Baez's original with 1.921. Multiplying 40 by 1.92 gives 76.82. The last decimal is dropped, and we have 76.8; 76.5 marbles is Baez's final quantity of marbles.\n\nAnswer: 3 marbles.\nOriginal Number: Baez has 40 marbles\nQuantity of Marbles Given: Baez's 40 marbles are multiplied by 1.9, or 76.5\n\n### Question: What is 7 + 53?\n\n### Answer: 60\n\n### Rationales:\n- Since the number 753 has 7 as its first number, the number 5 will go in the ten's slot of our answer, because that's the space we have free.\n- For the answer, start with 7 to form the ten's place, the hundred's place will be 0 + (5 x 10) giving us 50,", "answer": " 60"}
{"text": "The answer is D. All the clownfish are in the display tank because the blowfish can join the display tank, but the clownfish cannot exit the display tank and join the blowfish in another tank.\n\n### Note here that the question isn't about the blowfish but rather the clownfish. When the blowfish are removed and the aquarium now has 26 fish less, there's no explanation for the clownfish moving back and forth to the display tank. So, the clownfish must be in the display tank, and since that's the only place the blowfish aren't in, the clown fish cannot be in other tanks, leading to the answer being D\n\n### Detailed Response: The question states that an aquarium holds an equal of clownfishes and blowfishes, but then it states that 3 out of every 10 clownfishes return to the aquarium.  We know there's 26 blowfish, and the answer is 100, which means there must be 72 clownfish.  The question says the aquarium holds an equal amount of clownfish to blowfish, so if there is an amount of blowfish, the aquarium must have an equal amount of cough fish.  I'd read the question, then make those assumptions.  So I know that the aquarium has the same amount of clown fish and blowfish, meaning they're in the same two groups, the clown & blowfish. \n\nI know that there are 26 blowfish who remain in their tank but have the possibility to be seen by clownfish, and clown fish who are being seen by blowfish.  We know that an equal amount of clovnfsh and blowfish are in their own tank or display tank because the display tank is only getting half the blowfish, so the question is how many clown fish are in display tank. \n\n\n### When I read the question, I always try to make an assumption or think of how the statement is true.

{"text": "**Answer: E: 64 loads**\n\n### Instructions: Choose the word that most closely matches the sentence's meaning. To simplify, match each question with the answer that is closest in meaning.\n\n**Sentence 1**: The ghost was haunting the apartment building.\n**Rationales:** To understand and answer the question, take a look at each word and understand its specific meaning.\n\n1. \"Ghost\" refers to a spirit of someone who has died and is believed to interact with the living, often as a troublesome or frightening presence.\n2. \"Haunt\" means to visit repeatedly at the same place, often in a melancholy manner.\n3. Given this, the sentence implies that the ghost has visited and spent time in an area multiple times, typically with a melancholic intent. A ghost would be similar to a spirit, but often not directly specified as a dead individual.\n4. In contrast to a spirit, a ghost has some characteristics that are more like a person, and is considered as someone able to communicate with the living. \n5. In a more figurative sense, ghost can also be used to refer to a shadowy, evanescent aspect of something, such as its essence or qualities. \n6. In the sentence, the word \"ghost\" is used as a literal term, referring to a spirit or the essence of someone who is dead and seen or felt by the living after death. \n7.

{"text": "Anne will be 18 years old.\n\n### Rationale:\nStep1: Step 1:\nBoth Emile and Anne start at the same age, Anne being 8 years old. Then, Emile is 8 years old after 2 years. Then, Anne will be 16 after 2 years, which means she'll be 24 at the start of the next 2 years. Then Maude starts at 8 years old.\nThen, Maude will be 16 years old after 6 years while Emile will be 24 years old after 2 more years. That means Emile was 24 when Maude was 16, meaning they were both two times as old as Mau. Emile will be 18 when Maude is 8.\nThen, Anne will be 24 when Mau is 8 so Mau is six times as old as Anne.\n\nStep 2: Now we know what Maude had been after each year since Anne and Emile started their counting. Each time, Maude is six times older than Anne, so now we know Anne will be 108 in 16 years. Hence, she will be 102 at age 19, meaning she'll still be 18 at the end of the year. So we must get to the correct result, then add one before subtracting 1 in the previous equation.\n\nStep 3: Since Anne will be 17 at the begin, she's going to be 99 at the end of the 1 year.\n\nStep 4: Multiply 18+99, we get 114.

In this case, we can see, that there are two possible interpretations available: either (1) he does 15 push-up in each set or (2) he does 10 push-up in each.  \nThe question doesn't indicate which of the two interpretations is right, or give any context. Therefore, we can assume that he does 15 reps in each set.  \n2. To use the assumption we have made, we will consider the options. Option A is the one that is out: he does 3 sets, so it must be one of the first two options because the last one has already come in to effect.  \nOption B is not going to be the right option because he doesn't take three sets to finish, even if if the sets are not consecutive. For example, to get 45 reps from option B, he will have to do 5 push-up sets.  \nTherefore, the correct answer will be between option C and option D. We will assume that the third set is not exhausted and he does an odd number of reps only. Option D is the one that is more likely, according to this assumption, because he only takes 3 sets to finish the exercise instead of finishing with every set and we have assumed that he doesn't take consecutive set to finish.

Therefore, it is.5 + 2 = 2.5 puffs.\n- If we remove the puffs that Caleb's grandmother gets + the puffs that each of his friends gets, we have 30 - 2.5 = 27.5.\n- To divide each friend evenly, we have to add another 7.5 puffs, so 27.5 + 7.5 = 35\n\n### Dear friend,\n\nToday, we used our critical thinking and problem-solving skills to navigate through a reading passage and respond to a prompt!", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "We know that there were 333 particles on the porch before there were 223 after Samuel swept it. The number of particles swept was 331 less than the number not on the porch after Samuel swept it so we know that we have 62 less dust particles than there was before he swept it up. There were 9/10 the number not left on the porch when he swept it up so we have 333/9 which is equal to 37 which is 62/9 is 13.\nIn order to solve the question we first knew that there were 37 dust particles because there was 13 times as much left on the porch after the porch was swept. Using this we can solve the question 62/9=333/9 is equal to 62 x 37 = 2231.\n\n### Output: 2231\n\n### Demostration:\nInput:Let the number of particles = x\nSo he swept away:x-9/10 = 331 and after he swept away it so there are 62 less dust so:  x - 331= 37 So x= 37 x 4.32= 160.28 so the ans is 2231= 2231+62-223=2231+100= 3231.\nInput:Samuel swept this porch and cleared 9/10th of it.

{"text": "There is no answer to this question. It is impossible to determine how many goats the farmer has because any value that is derived as a result of solving this equation is not a natural number.\n\n### Explanation:\nIn order to find the number of goats the farmer might have, we need to understand the question so we can apply mathematical formulas to the equation. \n\nThe question asks us to solve for ____________ (X), the number of goats, given that ____________ (P) + ____________ (C) + ____________(G) = 56. \n\nTo find X (goats), we will apply ___________(addition,) to the equation, and will solve for the unknown ________________ (X) using any value we find for ____________ (P, C, G). If we choose ____________ (P), we will subtract ____________ (P)- ___________ (C) - ____________ (G) from the original equation to arrive at a different form:\n\nFor example, let us assume that the farmer has 24 goats.  Then, 24 - ____________ (P)+ _____________ (C) + _______________________ (G) = 54. We know it must be true that P+ C + G = 56, because this is what the question asks us to solve. \n\nTherefore, P - (24)+ ____________ (C)+ _______________ (G) - ____________(P) - ____________ C - ____________ (C), 54-24= 30. 30 = ____________________ x ____________________. The solution to that equation is X=10.\n\nSince it is _____________ (impossible) to obtain real numbers as answers to questions in the _____________ (test), we can not solve for X in this manner.

{"text": "The difference in the earnings on the two books last week is thirteen times the price of \"TOP\" and four times the price of \"ABC.\" Therefore, the difference is $104.\n\n### Solution:\n\nAt a certain bookstore the best-selling and the least-selling books are \"TOP\" and \"ABC\", respectively. These books are sold for $8 and $23 respectively.\nFor the problem to be solvable, the difference between the price of \"T\"OP\" and the price of \"ABC\" must be 13 times greater than the price of TOP.\n\nThat means that $23 * 13 = $309 and $327. We know that $8 times 13 = 15, so the difference is 3 to 14. We know that the difference is greater than 3, so we can subtract 3 from both sides to get 9 on the right side.\n\nAdding 3 to both sides we get: $23 * 9 = $128. To find what the difference is, we have to subtract 9 from both sides: $164. The difference is $164.\n\nSo the difference in the book store's earnings is $164 for the best-selling TOP and $23 for the least-selling ABC.

{"text": "The question asks how many weeks it would take John to progress from doing wall push-ups to doing floor push-ups.\n\n#### Option Explainer\n\nOption 1: [WALKERS](#WALKERS)\nThe wall push-up is a type of push-up that is performed against a wall. This option does not make any sense, the question and sentence are incoherent. \n\nOption 2: floor push-ups\nFloor push-ups are actual push-ups performed on the ground. John is training to progress from wall push-ups to floor push-ups. This choice matches the question well, since the training progress involves moving progressively from wall push-ups up to floor push-ups, which is exactly what John is doing.\nHence, option 2 is best answer choice.\n\n#### Explanation for Option 2\nThe question begins by describing John's plan to train for floor push-ups. It details the order of events: starting with wall pushes, adding a rep a day for each day of the week, once hitting 15 wall push-ups, doing high elevation, low elevation, and then finally floor push-ups each day.\nThis sentence implies that John trains five days a week for his push-ups. He starts with wall push-up which involves using a support like a table or wall to support him. After 5 reps, he progresses to the next part of his sequence, where he starts training on elevated surfaces which are lower to the ground (high elevation). Finally, he finishes with floor push-ups, where he is on the hardest and most elevated surface.\nTo answer the question, we need to identify how many weeks it takes John to get to floor push ups? \n\nWe know John trains 5 days a day, and is adding 1 rep a day.\n\nTherefore, John takes 5 rep days to complete his 5 day week.\n\nOnce he has completed 5 rep days training, he can move on to elevated surface training.\n\nFor this, we know that each wall push-up rep adds the equivalent of 1 high elevation floor push up.\n\nSince there are 5 rep days, that's 5 reps of wall push ups, and after these 25 reps, John should be able to do 5 high elevation", "answer": " 9"}

The question asks how much money the experienced sailors earned in the previous month (4 weeks). \n2. Because 17 sailors worked for 60 hours per week, the total weekly labor hours were 1020 hours.\n3. Because each experienced sailor received 5 times more paid hours than each inexperienced one, experienced sailors were able to be fully paid for a total of 5100 hours.\n4. Experienced sailors were thus paid $10/hour for the 5100 total combined hours they worked in the month.\n5. Because each hour of pay for a sailor was $10/hr, we can calculate the monthly earnings of each sailor as $51000.\n6. So, because there were 5 experienced sailors (5 x $5100/ sailor = $25500), the total combined monthly salary was 5 x $2550/ sailor = 12750.\n7.

The first question asked us to identify what kind of trip Tracy, Michelle, & Kati are on.  It was indicated that they are going on a road trip.\n2. The second question asked us to identify both the amount of miles that Tracy drives and the amount of miles that Michelle drives.  It should be evident that we find out that Tracy is driving 480 miles and Michelle is driving 450 miles.\n3. The third question asked us to identify exactly how much Tracy is driving than Michelle, and also how much Michelle is driving than Kati.  It should by now be obvious that this question would be the same as the first, since we are being asked to find out the exact amount of miles Tracy drives than Michelle, and Michell drives than Kati.  We know that Kati is driving 150 miles; therefore, this means that Michelle is driving 600 miles (+2 x 100), and Tracy is driving 60 more miles than that, making it a total of 660.  This can be verified by using a similar method as before which can be used to find how many miles Tracy drives than that.\n4. The fourth question is nearly identical to the third.

I hope I haven't made an enemy.\" said the princess. Answer the following grammatical question.Where should the sentence's last word be placed to make the sentence's grammar more correct? Choices: 1. After the subject 'you\u2019ve chosen.' 2. After the subject 'I hope'. 3. Before the word 'enemy'. 4. Before the end of the sentence. 5. After the verb'made'.\nRationales: In this question, the princess is expressing displeasure at the choice of a gift that the reader has made, indicating that the reader has been unwise in selecting the option.\nA. To make the sentence's grammer more correct, it would not be appropriate to place the last word of the grammatical sentence after the verb \"you've chosen\". This suggestion would imply that the princess is displeased at the reader's choice and that they have chosen a strange gift, which is a contradiction.\nB. To make the sentence more correct, the last word should be placed after the subject \"I hope\". The word \"I hope\" indicates that the princess is making this statement in the context of the gift being strange, suggesting that she understands why the reader chose this gift. Therefore, the sentence should end with a statement regarding her feelings towards the gift. The options do not convey such language, suggesting that placing the last word after the last word \"after the word 'enemy'\" or \"before the end of the sentence\" would be incorrect.\n\n## \ud83d\udcbf Notes\nThis exercise is an example of how a question can help to identify a logical fallacy, or an error in reasoning.

{"text": "The correct option is 'd'.\n\nThe statement gives the formula for two different numbers. We only know the current age of the speaker. The formula will tell us the future age, and how many years of age the speaker will be at a point in time. The future age can be calculated from the second formula (when we know the age of the brother).\n\nWe can use the known value of 8 to find the age of the brother in 10 years. When the statement says twice my brother's current age, the question is what is the difference between my current age and the age I will have in 10 years? When you have 8 years, you must subtract it from your current age. Subtracting 8 from 23, we find the answer 15.\n\nThe sum of our ages will equal a number when subtracting the younger's age from the older's age. Adding 100 to 8 gives us 108. 108 + 15 = 123. The future age formula gives us the following equation: (X+30) - 8 - (30-10) = 123, where 8 + 10 = 18, and 18 - (30 -10) = 23 or (X + 30) - X - 20. \n\nX=23, so 23 + 30 - 20 = 15.

They already have more than enough - 930 cards\n2. To make a pizza party happen, they only have to make 18 cards more.

The question asks us to identify the reason the speaker gave for why keeping a large dog out of trouble is as easy as keeping a smaller dog out of trouble.\n2. The speaker implies that it is just as easy to keep any type of dog out of trouble, as long as a specific behavior is prevented.\n3. Looking into the choices, they all sound like reasons it would be difficult to consistently keep a large dog out of all trouble.\n4. Since the speaker's focus was on the ease of keeping a dog out of trouble, we can eliminate D. \"you trainit to stop\". \n5. Thus, \"unless it gets mad at a squrrel\" is the most suitable choice.\n6. \"gets mad at squirrels\" implies that the speaker is saying it is difficult to make a large dog not get mad at squirrel. \n7.

{"text": "The maximum number of residents that might live in this block of apartments is 24\n### Explanation: This is a 10 point question.\n\nInput: In a large company, who would be the manager? Choices: \tA: employee B: staff member C: associate D: subordinate E: assistant\nRationales: This task asks about what kind of person a large company might have as a manager. From the given options, a manager is one level directly above other employees. That being the case, the only people that fits that description is employees. So, The answer is A: employee.\n\n#### The Explanation: The task asks who would be a manager in a large company. Since the task mentions a large company, we can assume the company is a private sector company or corporation. In a large corporation or private sector company, there would be lower-level employees and upper-level employees. Therefore, from the answers given, A and B are upper-level employees, since they are managers. Also, C is a middle-level employee, since they are an associate. Therefore, D and E are lower-level employees, since employees are subordinates and assistants are to a manager. \n\nInput: Which bird would see an eagle in the distance?

{"text": "Fred's weekly allowance is $8.\n\n### Rationales: 1-  Fred spent half of his allowence going to the movies, which is $8.He washed the family car, which was worth $6. So,  Fred spent $14.This means Fred earns $8. \n\n2- First, write the sentence Fred spent 8 dollars going to the movies and 6 dollars washing the family car and earned  6 dollars.\n3- To solve the problem, subtract 6 from 14 dollars. Then, you will get a total of 8 dollars, Which is the amount that Fred ends with. \n\n### Instructions:Fred spent twice of his allowance going the movies. He did something that earned him 14 dollars. What is Freds allowance?\n\n### Rationale:A. The sentence is about: Fred spent twice of his allowence going the movies.\nB. To answer the question, we need to understand the idea behind Fred's allowance, which refers to the amount of money a parent or guardian provides to their child on a regular basis.\n\nC. Given the context, Fred's allowance could be inferred to be a fixed amount, rather than variable. To further determine the amount, we must consider the information in the context, that Fred earns 14 dollars.\n\nD. The sentence states that Fred did something that earned him a total of 14 dollars. This indicates that Fred typically earns money by doing chores and tasks, and that his allowance could be determined by deducting the amount earned from the regular allowance amount.\n\nE. The question then asks what amount Fred's allowance is if we subtract the 14 dollars that he earned. To solve the problem, we need to take half of the regular allowance amount and subtract the earned amount ($8). This leaves us with 8 dollars as the total amount Fred's allowence.\nA. The sentence is: Fred spent twice of is allowence going the moviies. \nB. The meaning of allowing is providing someone with the means or permission to do something. Freds allowence is what he gets from his parent when he goes to the movies. \nC. \n\nAnswer: Freds weekly allowence is $8.", "answer": " 16"}
{"text": "Pete can leave for the 0900 departure at 0740.\n\n### Step 1: The instructions ask you to identify the departure time for a train.\n\n### The question refers to a trip to LA. To answer, we have to calculate the start time for the train that gets you to LA at 0900.\n\n## Step 2: We know 12:00 is midnight and 1:00 is am, while 1:20 and 3:00 are pm. Thus, 08:40 is equivalent to 8:20 am, which is between the 7:00 am and 8:00am train arrival on the train schedule.\n\n### 08:49 am is after 7:00am departure but before 8:00 am departure\n\n## Step 3: That means Pete can actually leave at 0749 am.\n\n## Step4: To be on time, Pete can leave at 07:40 am\n\nAnswer: Pete can leave at: 7:40am.\n\nInput: In the garden,  where were the children playing?

{"text": "1. Rationales: the question seeks to ascertain the cost that Mr. Caiden is left paying\n2. We need to find the total amount Mr. Caiden has to pay for the remaining 50 feet of metal\n3. This can be obtained simply. First, we have 50 feet to solve for.\n3. Next, we multiply the price of a single foot by the number of feet.\n4. Since we already have 8 dollars given in the question, we have the price of one foot.\n5. Finally, we have to multiply the total of $8 by the 300 total feet.\nNote: \nThere are two options to solve this, the first would be the more common way of multiplying. \nThe second is to note that 50 feet is a simple factor of 300 feet, so 50'= 250'3. Therefore, 50'3 = ***********\n\nAnswer: 2800 Dollars. The correct answer is (2800) dollars.\n\n### Explanation:\n3. The solution is found by multiplying the price by the number of feet multiplied by the number of remaining feet.\n4. This method is preferable because it is easy to find the price of the 1 foot, as it is already given in the question.\n5. However, this solution does not take into consideration that 1 foot is equal to 1/3 of 300 foot.\n6. Multiplying a number by a whole-number fraction would produce a whole number, thereby losing the accuracy of our answer.\n7. This is why we used the second method, where we multiplied by 2/3 because by using this method, each individual cost of a foot is $2.73, resulting in a total cost for the remaining feet of $2.73*50= 136.65.\n8. It can be noted that multiplying each 1 foot result and adding them is the same thing as multiplying all the 1 feet result together, which results in the same answer.\n9.

This means that 50% percent of it is pure alcohol, while the remaining 50% is water.\n3.Using this information it can be concluded that every 1.5 ounges of vodka is equivalent to one ounce of pure alcohol.\n4. This can be mathematically shown as $V_1.5 = 0.5$\n5. We can now use the equation $V_1.2 = N$ where $V_1.6$ is the number of ounces of voder and $N$ is the quantity of pure alcohol in one 1.5 ound of vodka and $N = 0.5 * 1.6 = 0.8$\n6. So, Jake would have drank 8 ounces of vodeer and 0.8 ounces of pure alochol.\n7. As we now know the quantity of pure alcoholo Jake drank, we can now determine the quantity of alcohol divided by its 100%.\n8. So, Jake had 6 ounces pure alcohol.\n9. Thus, the correct answer to our original math question is 6.\n\n### Input:\"It took 8 months for me to get over the death of my mother.

{"text": "The oven was 15/18th done with the process and the burger took four 1/6ths of a minute.  The fries also took exactly as long.  26 seconds.\n\n### The explanation:The first step is to find the difference between the amount of time that the fries needed to cook, and the time that actually needed to cook. We do not need to add the two amounts together. We need to subtract the amount needed to cook in the oven to the time that actually did in the oven. The difference is how many seconds that are left. Since the question mentions that it was recommended, and not the correct amount. We subtract because there is a certain amount of excess that we will use in our fraction. We need to write out the fraction using a mixed number. It was recommended for a whole oven, because one of the minutes is divided by 18 french fries. We need to multiply the amount of time needed, by eighteen, to get the amount that each french fry needed, to be cooked. This is how we can subtract what the recommended time was, to the time actually used to cook. There are fourteen seconds left. We have to add a minute because there was fourteen seconds remaining. We then multiply by six, to get the fractions that we need. After we get to our mixed number, 45, we must use it as a denominator, and 40 as the numerator. 45-40 is 5 and 45-41 is 4 since they would be the same.

{"text": "Answer Hannah should prepare 5 cups of dog per day for her three dogs. The first method is to add up the individual amounts per dog, and then subtract from that sum the amount for the first dog, which is 21\u20444.

To get that total, subtract the total of one dog, which is 3, and then multiply three times the amount one dog eats. The third method uses multiplication to get a total of around 19 which is then subtracted from 38.\n\nThe difference between \"Method 1\" and \"Method 2\" is \"how many cups of dog per dog eats\", or essentially \"how many cups do a dog need per day?\".

{"text": "After first taking his deductions and tithes, $1% of the total amount left will be used to cover any incidentals he may have such as extra food, gas, or clothing. That leaves him with $483.\n\n### Rationale:Let's look first to the question about Alex's weekly income and deductions.  It gives us the necessary facts we need to answer the question \"How much money does Alex have?\"  (This is important because the remaining money for Alex is what we are asking the student to calculate.)  The main two facts we are given are the amount of money Alex receives each week ($500) and the deduction on his total income each week ($55, a 10% deduction).  Once we use this information and these facts to answer how much Alex has left, only then can we go on to answer how much change Alex will have left.\n\nNext, we need to answer the main question by putting into place the facts we acquired in the previous part (we already know how much Alex had left each week).  Once we have the information that Alex brings in $500 and gives away at least 10% of that, we know that the remainder of the $500 left is a percentage (a dollar amount as a percentage of the total amount given.)  \nWe are then able to further break down the percentile into how much money he has left after taxes then we know what amount he has after he pays the rest of his bills.  This is $483.  But now, we need to take into account the change he must have left from the first week to the rest of the weeks.  So, we must be able to figure out how much change remains each week in order to give Alex enough money to cover what he needs to continue to live off of.  Finally, we need to determine how much money Alex's bills cost each week.  Using this information, we can answer that Alex will have $5 after he gives what he needs to pay for his bills of $55 the first week and $43 the remaining weeks.  So, after this process, we know that Alex brings in $1000, gives $55 each week to his water bill, $43 each week in total for his bills, and has $40 left each week to live off of.", "answer": " 345"}

The word \"provide\" in this sentence is a verb that means to give something to someone. So, the sentence would mean \"The study is undertake to give...\" which does not make sense and would not be appropriate for the context in which it is used.\n2. In contrast, the phrase \"the study is undertake to obtain\" is a grammatically-correct and logical sentence. It implies that the study is intended to achieve a specific result or objective. The word \"obtain\" in this sentence is used in the sense of achieving or acquiring something rather than giving.\n3. Thus, the answer to the question \"What is the purpose?\" is \"the study is undertaked to obtain\".\nAnswer: The study is undertaken to get something (the purpose).\n\n### Input\n\"It is possible.\"\n\n### Demos\n\nResponse:\n\"It is possible to answer in this way.\"\n\n### Rationales\n1.\"It is possible to do something.\" does not make sense as a sentence.

{"text": "Let n represent the number of actors on the show at one time. There have been a total of m actors and since each actor must be in the show for 15 minutes, the total number of minutes the actors are on stage must be m*15. There are 60 minutes in an hour, therefore we need to find the inverse of 15/60=1/4. Therefore m/(4n)=1. Let us define an inverse of m as inverse m. We are looking for the inverse of 4n. Therefore inverse m must be equal to inverse (4n). Since inverse m is equal inverse 4n, dividing both sides by 4 we get 4 inverse m is equal to inverse n. Then taking inverses of n and all powers of 4 we are left with 4 inverse n= 1/4. The number of actors at one time can then be calculated as n=(4/1)*(1/4)=4.\n\n**Solution:** Let \\({n \\over 4}\\) be the number of actors at a time, so that the number of actors on stage at any time \\(T\\) can be given by \\(n\\,T\\).

On the other hand, the orchard contains 45 peach tree, each one of which should have the potential to produce 65 kg of peaches. \n3: This indicates that each orchard contains 37000 kg of fruit overall. \n4: We can also tell from the orchard description that the farmers planted 30 apple trees and 45 peaches trees. \n5: Because there are more peach trees than apple trees in the orchard, the total number of peach trees is 22000 kg larger than the total number of appple trees. This means the number of peaches harvest should be (30 * 150) + (45 * 65) * 2200/ 30 = 280 kg greater than the number of apples harvest. \n6: Since the orchard contains an equal number of apple and peach trees, the total number of fruit harvests must be (37000 * 30) + (3700 * 45) * 280/ 300 = 430000 kg\n\n### Choices\n\nWe can eliminate 'B.' because it states that each apple tree produces 150 kg. Given that 30 apple trees produce 150 kg apples and 280 kg peaches, the correct answer should not be 150.\nIn addition, 'C' doesn't provide the total number of peeaches, which means the farmers are unable to produce enough peaches to fill the difference between the number of apples and peaches. Because of this, the correct answer should also give the total number of peches that are harvested.\n'D' would only make sense if the orchard contained 44 peaches, not 45; otherwise we would have to", "answer": " 7425"}

{"text": "Bobby paid 1436\n\n### Explanation: You know the cost of the shoe is 250, so the new cost is going to be 85 dollars. You also know the hourly charge is 75 dollars so with 8 hours, you know the total is 600 dollars. You know the total charge is going to be 600 dollars times 85% to make it 510 dollars. If you want to multiply the 510 dollars by 250, you get 127500. If you want to take the 1275 dollars and divided by 100, you get 2012 dollars.

Now if we look at the side length of the cube, which is the side we will take out, it is either 8 cm or 6 cm. \n4. Now as option E, F or G are larger than the side length on one side, we can eliminate them as well, because the cube is the same after the subtraction or division.\n5.

B) When there is no external force acting on the object, it will move horizontally.\"\n\n### Response:\"B) When there is no outside force acting on the object.\"\n(This will do)\n\n\n## Task Context:\n\nThe task context is a short description of the scenario we are analyzing. For the example test, there are 20 tasks. The first 4 tasks all deal with the same subject - a machine. So, in this task context, we are analyzing a machine. Task contexts should give the reader an idea of what kind of task is coming. In our example, there are 2 types of tasks, which will be described in the next subheading; however, when you first encounter a task context, give it a quick once-over to get a general idea of what you are dealing with and what kind of solution it needs.\n\n## Types of Tasks:\n\nWhen you deal with a task, there are a few ways the question will be phrased.  In some cases, you might be asked to simply answer the question in a sentence.  Other times, you might need to take more formal steps by using the given values and equations to complete an algebraic equation and then derive and answer from that formula.  The following are some examples of the ways in which different texts will ask you to solve the question.\n\n## Problems in English\n\nQuestions may also be presented in a problem-solving format.  Often, such questions will present a problem that needs an algebraic solution.  You will then need to understand how to interpret the quantities and the steps to come to the correct answer. For example:\nInput: If Marvin earns \\$1 and each week he spends \\$5, how much money does Marvin have after six months?\nRationales: Answer: \\$133.33 (180/12)\nAnswer: D: \\$133 (18/12)\n\nSolution: Marvin earns \\$5 more than", "answer": " 45"}

Ittymangnkar is a fisherwoman and is able to catch enough fish every day to feed everyone in the family for the day. However, she divides them into equal shares, giving half to each person, including herself. In total, they eat 3/24 of their total fish portion, that is, 3/2 of the total catch each. Oomyapeck, however, takes all of their fish eyes (3/24 of all the fish portion, and as each eye is 0.0635 kg, that comes to 1.35g of eyes per day) but gives 2 eyes to their dog, and eats 21/23 eyes for himself. Thus, since Oomyapeck gives 2/635 kg of eyes to their dog, they are left with 21/634 eyes, which weighs 778.03g.

{"text": "The total amount of bananas is 854\n\n### Explanation\n\nWe can use the equations below to calculate the amount of bananas each monkey gets:\n\nAmount of bananas per pile = 9 * (number of hands in 1 pile)\nAmount of bananas in a pile = 4 * 14 = 56\n\nSo, the total amount of bananas that can be calculated from the equations above is:\n\n28n * 4 = 28 * 14 = (n \ufffd 4) = 72n\n\nwhere n is the number of piles in the family of 12.\nBut, n is also the number of bananas distributed per hand, so we can cancel out the 4 in the equation and get:\n\n28 * n = 72n = (n \ufffd n)\n\nMultiply the left side by (1) n and we get:\n\nThe left side is therefore equal to:\n\n28 + n \n\nSince we know the first equation for total bananas is:\n\n854 = 28n\n\nwe can divide both sides by 28 to get:\n\nn = [(1/2) * (28 + n)]\n\nHence, we have an n value where:\n\nn = 3\n\nThe total bananas are therefore [(1/2) \ufffd (28 + n)], which comes out to:\n\n(854 + 28 * n) / 2 - (n)\n\nOr approximately 254.\nReminder: When dividing by 2, the math is actually equal to (n + 1) because we keep the remainder and add one.", "answer": " 99"}

The sentence includes information about a rectangle measured by Irene.\n2. 'Volume' is the measure of the amount of space something takes up. In other words, it's an exact number that's a total of space taken up by an object.\n3. The formula given, v = ax, suggests that the volume can be figured out by multiplying the area (A) by the x length (L).\n4. Let's solve the question using that formula, making assumptions about the variables: V = volume of rectangle A= area of rectangle L= length of rectangle\n\nSo, V = A x L\n\nLet's substitute the information we know about the variables into that equation: V = 42 x 6\n\n6. 0.64 ft is a reasonable amount of volume.\n\n7. Hence, 0.64 feet is the answer, since that's the volume of the rectangle.\n8. Option 1, 0.16ft, is wrong as that's a fraction too small.\n9.

Choices: A. 65% B. 57% C. 43% D 62% E. 2.3 miles.\n\nRationales:The question only focuses on 'free- falling time'. For skydivers it refers to having jumped out of a high altitude with no parachute. In this case, skydivers use a parachute to slow down the decent and reach the ground. Hence free-falling time has no relevance to skydivers.\nAs it is asked that skydiver has 1 hour free-falling time. We cannot use other parameters of skydiving.\nSo the answer we are looking for is only based on earth's dimensions as we have earth and not other dimensions.\n\nEarth's dimension is 12,742 miles.

A: Cheaper\n    A. An increase of square footage for a vegetable produce comes with a proportional increase of expenses. This is because vegetables come with a high cost of production in terms of water, energy utilities and time. Therefore, a low plot size gives the vegetable producer an opportunity to grow a greater produce from the small plot than from the land of more size.\n    B. Land is not cheaper or more expensive to be sold on. In fact, it is a commodity and it gives an opportunity the farmer in case of a crop failure to grow another produce as a way of earning some profits from his garden.\n    C.

As her ability to juggle increases, she can add more objects.\nAfter 5 weeks of practising, if she starts out with 3 objects and practises them for 5 weeks, she will ultimately be able to juggle 8 objects.\n\nRationales:Step 1: The question is asking about an amount of time, X. \n\nStep 2: We can deduce that X is the number of objects Jeanette can juggle after 5 weeks because the question is referring to an increase in the number of objects she can juggle as each additional week passes.\n\nStep 3: We can infer that Jeanette practises for 5 weeks total and initially starts with 3 objects because the question is asking about the final number after a given amount of time has passed.\n\nStep 4: This inference implies Jeanette begins with 3 objects and adds to that amount, meaning that the first day she is practicing with 3 juggled objects, and by the end of the week she is juggling with 4, then at the end of 2 weeks she is juggling 5 objects, and so on.\n\nStep 5: We can find the final number of objects that Jeanette can juggle by applying these reasoning to our question, taking note of the time in the question's prompt and comparing it to our calculations.\n\nStep 6: The prompt states that Jeanette started off with 3 juggles initially, and after 5 weeks she is able to juggle 5 juggles per day. Because Jeanette is increasing the number that she's juggling, this means that she can juggle 8 objects by the end of the 5 week period.\n\nStep 7: If 'x' represents the final number of objects Jeanette is able to juggle after practising for 5 weeks, then, the correct answer is 8 and would be A.\n\nAnswer:A: 8\n\nInput:You need to study math to graduate from the university.

{"text": "As there are a total of 20 occupied seats of capacity 2, there are 8 seats of capacity 3.\n\nSo, there are 3 empty seats.\n\nTherefore,\n\n2/5 = 4/\n\n4/20 = 4(2/5)\n\n4(2/5)*4/1 = 4(2*2/5)*4*1 = 16*8/100*4 * Number of attended board members\n\nWe need to find the product \n\nThen, 16/8*8/8 = 16/6 = 26 people attended.\n\n### The reason to get the answer as 15 seats in total:\n\nSince we can infer that 2/5 means 40 chairs are occupied, we can also infer 4/5 = 16 seats that are empty.\n\nTherefore 16 chairs are not occupied.\n\nFor the given example, each 'full' chair was either occupied by 2 people or 3 people. \nSo, there are a total of exactly 16 chairs that are not occupied. \nSo, the solution should be 4/20 = x/x + 16/x \n\nAnswer: 26 people attended the meeting\n\n### Response2:\nThe reasoning behind my answer is below: First of all we must figure out the sum of all the chairs and their capacity. 20+40=60. 60/2=30. The third row is empty and there are 26 members, so we subtract 26 from the total sum of chairs and their capacity to achieve 30-26=4 chairs. \n\nEach chair in the third row can have a maximum of 2 people per chair.  If 26/26 = 1/1, and each chair in the third row is occupied by 2 people, this would indicate that each of the 4 seats will have 2/2 = 1/1 people in each, therefore making each chair 50% empty. The fourth row has 50% of the available seats filled.  If 25/50=5/10, and each seat can have 2 people, this indicates there are 10", "answer": " 48"}

But, we do not know the number of video games Daniel has, so we don't know how many games he bought for $7 each.\n3. From here, we know that the percentage of video games that cost $7 each is 50%.\n4. So, we can divide the number of video games in his collection by two, because the half of the 346 video that cost $3 each represent the other 50% of games that cost $7.\n5. He would buy 173 copies of video games for 7, since he bought 50% of the other 50%.\n6. So, we multiply 173 by $7 to find how much he spent on the ones that cost $7 each.\n7. That means he would spend $1219 on games that cost $7, but not the ones that cost $12 each.\n8. We don't even know the number of video game that cost $12, so we can't find out how much he used to pay for those.\n9.

Now, we already know we spent $1219, that is more than $1118 so we know we have more than 346 copies of games that cost $3 each.\n11. By finding out how many videos games he has, we can calculate how much he spent on all the video games.\n12. Let's say he has 354 games for a cost of $12 each of the first 80, then $7 each of the next 173 and finally $3 each of the remaining that would be 354x$12= $4336.\n13.

D: For it is not possible.E: This action cannot occur with a perfect amount.\n\t\t\t\nRationales: Answer D is the correct answer because your mouth doesn't fill up to the top because it's not possible to fill it.\nWhen you eat something, your mouth doesn't get full up to the top because food is a liquid. This action cannot occur with perfection.\n\n### How to Answer\n\nTo answer, we need first to define the terms.\n\nAnimal: Organisms that can reproduce.\nFour-legged animal: Organisms that walk around on two legs.\nFulfil: Make something full up.\nGrow food in: Growth of any.\nManmade: Artificially.\nPure: Pure\nRely: Dependent.\n\nThis is the only question that doesn't work.\n\nIt is true, that animals grow up as a child or as a baby, but do not grown up as an adult with legs. Animals do not grow food in or on with animal with legs. You may buy fruit and vegetables, but that does not mean you will grow the fruits in or with a fruit with legs. You grow food that have fruits and vegetables. A tree does not grow apples, but can have an apple on it. The tree has apples, not it grows apples, although it can grow fruit.\n\n#### A is true because a manmade robot is not animal.\n\n#### B is true because a four-legged animal is not manmade.\n\n#### C is false because a four-leged animal is not animal.\nA four-legged animal has feet on the floor that it walks on.  Animals are organisms that can reproduce.  Four-legged animals can grow up.\n\n#### D is true because a four legged animal", "answer": " 50"}

{"text": "The question is asking us how many minutes it would take Nate to search the parking lot if he can walk past 10 cars per minute.  \n\nTo solve this question, we would start by calculating what fraction of the total cars he can walk past if he goes through each row each minute.\n\tSo, we would multiply 10 cars x 15 rows times 1/60, which equals 0.0167. We can then convert this to a decimal by dividing it by 0.01 and rounding down. This gives us 0.167 as the fraction of cars Nate would have been able to walk past in 1 minute.\n\nNext, we can assume that this number, (0.167), is the number of cars per minute he can walk past. \n\nThe question is describing Nate walking through every row in sections G and H, so, we know that there are a total of 35 rows between G and H. The question is asking what fraction of these 35 rows Nate could walk through in 1 minute. Because we are multiplying a known fraction (0.1667) times the number of rows each section has, we can solve for the answer using this formula: \n\t0.16667 x 15 = 2.4999\t0.167 x 20 = 3.3550\n\tSo, we can also say that in 1 minute Nate could walk past 5 cars from each section (2 + 3 = 5, assuming they are adjacent), so that he would need 35/5 * 1 minutes to walk through every row of every section.\n\nFinally, the question asks us to calculate how many minutes this would take in total. \n\tWe know the fraction to be 5/15, and we know that multiplying this fraction by any number will give 1, just like multiplying any other fraction by 1 will also yield 1. This means that we can simply multiply 35/5 by 1 to get the number of minutes it would take for Nate to walk through every row.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7 days. \nAnswer: 7\n\n### Input : The best way to reach your career goal is to find a mentor.", "answer": " 30"}

Choices:  a. open an envelope b. eat food c. find small fish d. bite large fish e. bite people f. make fish sounds\nRationales: This question asks us to pick something that the shark can use its snout to do. We only need to choose correct answers.\nWe can rule out 'b. eat food' right away since sharks don't eat with their snout and the rest will be easier.\n\nWe can cross out 'c. find small fish' because you can use the snout senses to find something the same way you use the snout to bite something. For example, a whale has a large snout with a rhinophylax (tactile organ) on the surface of it, this serves as a sort of 'whisk' that the whale uses to find something.\nThat leaves 'e. bite people', but in this context the snout means the noodle which is used for eating. So that isn't the answer.\nWe can also cross out 'f. make fish sounds' because the snout is an internal ear and it is impossible for the shark to make fish sounds.\nWe can cross out the rest of the answer because if we cross out every other answer, there won't be anything else left to choose from.\nHence 'A.

How long before it is complete and ready to use again?\nRationales:Answer - The answer is D: 50 days.\n\nThe question asks about a machine that is very complicated so is difficult to use.\n\nLet's think about what the task might mean.\nOne interpretation is that the machine's use is broken and the employees would like it to be working again so they can use it.\n\nThis interpretation leads us to eliminate certain answers.\n\nFor example, B: wash dishes, C: box, and E: implement are inapplicable to the context. Washing dishes is a job and dishes can't be fixed back to working state - a washing machine would need to be used. An implement is a tool and as explained above - it can't be made back to a working state - a mop would need to be used instead. A box is just a box - it doesn't do anything.\n\nThe other way to interpret this question is that the company had made a large purchase and had received a complicated piece of machinery that they would like to be in working order again.\n\nThis interpretation still rules out dishes. How can workers wash a bunch of washing machines?\nBoxes - there are no obvious boxes that employees can use to fix this complicated machinery or make it work.

Thus, each book's average cost = $(5.90*0.9)/6(=0.585) + 0.009 = 1/0.009 -0.005.5 = $59.8.\n5. Rounding off the last two decimal places => 60$/0.5 = $120, which we can shorten to 120$, and 12/20 = 6, which can easily be converted to 0.3, and 1.3, which can round off to 1.

Each unit of caffeine is the same as a chocolate bar for a good comparison. so 750 g chocolate bars.\n\n### Detailed:\nHe drinks 2 high caffeinated drinks.\n\"High\" is adjectival and modifies \"drinks.\"\nEnergy drinks are non-alcoholic beverages that typically contain a high amount of sugar, caffeine and other ingredients, such as taurine, found in many types of energy drinks. \n\nCaffeine (C8H10N4O2\u00b72 H2O) is an organic compound found naturally in coffee, tea, cocoa and many other foods and beverages.\n\n250 milligrams of caffeiene per 8-ounce serving is equivalent to about 5 grams per can or 80 mg per oz.\n\nThe second drink has 3X more caffine per ounce, so 3 times. \n\nLets say 12 ounces.  \nso it is 360 mg of caffeine and 120 mg of cafiine per oz.\nThe second drink is only 3 ounces, so about 360 mgs of caffine.\nThen 1 energy pill has the caffine of both drinks, so it is 720 mgs.\n\nNow we can calculate 750 mgs/oz of the drinks.\n\n1 ounce = 28.3 grams and 12 oz = 144 grams\n\nWe can use that information to find 750/144 is 5.\n\nso 750/5 = 5 ounces.\n\n750 gm/chocolate bar is correct.\n\nThe energy drink is equivalent to a 5 ounce chocolate bar.\n\n### Output:John drinks 40 Ounces and 360 mgrs of caffine at about 12 c", "answer": " 750"}

The question then states that a hole developed in the bag and mentions that Tanya only had nine fruit pieces left. We know that one of the pieces was a plum, so we are asked to identify how many plums Tanya bought.\n\n### Rationales:\n1) The bag developed a hole before Tanya arrived back home \n2) After arriving back home, the bag developed a hole and her fruit fell out of the hole \n3) After arriving back at home, 9 fruits fell out of the bag, so 1 of them is a plum\n4) There is only one basket of plums, so Tanya must have bought the 1 plum\n5) Since 1 (of the 9) fruits were a plum, Tanya could have only bought 2 (of the 4) plums\n6) Tanya must have bought an even number of fruits in all, thus Tanya could only have bought 3 or 6 fruits in all\n\nTherefore the correct answer is 5\n\n### Rationale:\nThe question is asking for the number of plums that Tanya bought. The question states that Tanya bought a \"small basket of plums.\" A basket suggests that it is a small group or quantity of something. The plums were also mentioned as being only a \"small basket.\" Based on this information, the reader could assume that plums were Tanya's primary objective for buying the food since they were mentioned last. If the reader believes this, the remaining plums could have been used in a variety of different recipes or snack ideas, and there could have been multiple other fruits present in the basket. Therefore, we could only conclude that Tanya purchased a \"small batch\" of plums, or less than a half dozen, since there were so many other foods in the initial bag. From there, it's simple math. We know for certain that there were nine plums left in the bag,", "answer": " 6"}

{"text": "Roberto and Valerie can total 2,320 skips.\nTo understand the problem, let's translate it to a mathematical expression. Let R = number of skips Robert can make in an hour, and V = number of skips Valerie can make in a minute. We know they spend 900 seconds skipping. So, R x V x 900 is the total number of skips (and the way it is written). To convert it to hours, divide it by 3600. This is how many times Roberto and Valerie can skip for one minute. From here, we can figure out how long each of them have to skip per hour to total their skips. We can determine this for Roberto who can skip 4, 200 times per hour by dividing R by 4200, which is 3.5625, and for Valerie dividing V by 80, giving us 8.75. For our example, Roberto skips 357 times in every hour and Valerie can skip 9 times every hour. Both of them could skip for 45 seconds to total 783 times per hour. And they must skip together for 15 minutes straight. 15 minutes divided by 783 is 19. 19 of Robert's 45 jumps plus 19 of Valarie's 90 jumps equals 138 total skips.\n\n### Rationale:Let's see how it is done.\nAnswer:798\n\n### Input & Solution: \n![img](./resources/images/2948.jpg)\n\n### Rationales: ANSWER: 12\n\n### Input, Solution and Rationales:\nThe image shows the solution for the puzzle.\n![img](./resourc\u2026/22908.jpeg)\n\n### Input and Solution:\nThe image shows a solution for this puzzle.\n![input](./resources/29684.jpg)\n![solution](./resources/20016.jpeg)", "answer": " 2,250"}

Based on the context, the country in which China is located - China -  is not applicable to this question.\n\nLooking at the three options \"C\", \"D\" and \"E\", we can rule out the answers that include \"Tibet\" since this word is not a country.\n\nHence, options \"C\", \"E\", \"D\" and F\" are all relevant to the context.\n\nHowever, options \"D\" and \"F\" use the same synonym or alternate word for \"Tibet\" which is \"Tibet\".\n\nAnd option \"D\" refers to a location and does not address the question - where a game is from, as indicated in the context.\n\nTherefore, options \"C\" and \"F\" can be eliminated.\n\nFrom choosing between options \"E\" and \"C\", we can tell that they are different since \"E\" refers to a game and \"C\" to a location - Tibet.\n\nFor option \"E\", since it refers to a nation/region of China, I believe this is the correct option since the question is specifically asking about China. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is", "answer": " 80"}

{"text": "The stuffed animal which cost just less than the cost of the magnet(2x$3).\n\n### Rationale:\nThe logic behind solving is as follows:\n\nLet's assume that the cost of the magnet was equal to $x and that of the stuffed animal as $3x. Now, since $x is thrice of $3, the magnet costs three times the price of the stuffed animal.\n\nThis leads us to think that the two options are:\n$x = 6 and $x = 9 \n\nSince the total cost (price) of the two stuffed is equal to $3x, the price of each stuffed animal would be $3x/2 which equals $3x/2.\n\nHence,\n$3x/2 = $3\nAnd, since $3/2 = $1.5\nhence, the amount for single stuffed animal which cost $3, is $3/2 = 1.5", "answer": " 6"}
{"text": "Terese runs an average distance of 4 miles each day.\n\n### Solution:\nInput: Terese averages 4 miles each day she runs, Monday through Thursday.

For example, we can say that if Terese runs 4.2 +3.8, then she must run 8 miles on Monday to make the total 18.6.\nSubtracting 8 from 18.6 gives the distance Terese runs on Tuesday. \nYou can perform a similar process for Wednesday and Thursday. \nAnalyze Terese's data and come up with the number for each day.\nAnswer: 4 miles each day, Monday through Thursdays.\n\n### Example:\nTerese runs Average distance\n4.2 miles 3.8 miles 3.6 miles 4.4 miles    \nMonday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday\nSolution 1\n(4.2 + 4.4) * 2 = 16 + 17 = 33\nSolution 2\n(4.2) * 2 + (3.8) * 2 +  (3.6) * 2 +     (4.4) *2\n= 8 + 7.6 + 7.2 + 8.8\n= 30\n\n### Example 2:\nTerese works at UPS 4.2 miles 4.3 miles 4.9 miles 4.8 miles   \nEach day\nSolution 1: (4.2 + 6.35) * 4 = 20.9\nSolution 2: (4.2) *5 + (4.3) *4 + (4.9) *5 + ( 4.8) *4 = 41.6\n\n### Example#3:\nTerese lives on East 23rd Avenue.

{"text": "16 pages total\n\n### Rationales:\nThe given question is about how many pages a person would have in his or her journal over a certain period.\nStep 1: We need to identify the relationship between the number of pages Mack writes in his journal and the times he writes in it.\nStep 2. The first sentence of the question tells us that Mack writes in his journal every Monday at the same time.\nStep 3. In this case, every Monday Mack writes for 60 minutes, or 1 page for every 30 minutes, during which he continues writing until he has filled 60 minutes or written 1 page. Thus, we already know that writing = 1 page for every hour x 30 minutes.\nStep 4. Subsequently the second sentence of the question tells that Mack writes from Monday to Wednesdays. In this case, Mack writes in his journals for 45 minutes instead of 60 minutes for every Monday. We need to understand what that means.\nStep 5. We know that writing = 30 minutes x 1 page. This equation will serve as our baseline throughout. So every 30 minutes equals 1 page.\nStep 6. Thus, if Mack writes 45 minutes when he usually writes 60 minutes, then Mack writes 3 more pages when he usually writes 1 page for every half an hour.\nStep 7. Continuing, the third sentence of the question tells Mack writes on Wednesday for 5 pages in his journals, which means he writes 5 times as much as usual in his journals.\nStep 8. The first three steps tell us that for Monday and Tuesday Mack writes 1 page for each thirty minutes he writes and on Wednesday Mack writes for 5 pages.\nStep 9. Adding up what we now know, we can see that on Monday and Tuesday, which are the days that Mack writes the most, Mack writes for 6 hours and writes 1 page for 6 hours x 30 minutes x an hour in his journals. On Wednesday Mack writes 5 extra pages for a total of 6 pages written for the Wednesday.\nStep 10. To sum up what we have written in the previous steps, Mack writes for 1 page for every thirty minutes he writes on Monday, Tuesday, and Wed", "answer": " 10"}

If the blue car can travel a rate of 80 miles an hour, at what rate can the orange car travel?\n\nThe clues here are the numbers that are being compared in the first two questions. \n\nWe knew that Dale owns 4 cars, and that the yellow is broken, so the numbers we are left with are 4 and 2/3 of the total number of cars.\n\nSo, in this question, the clues tell us that the answer to this question should be the same speed as the red car in the first example. Since we know that that speed is 4 times the speed that the yellow one can travel, we know that the answer is 4.\n\nNow, let's try the next question.  Dale owns 5 cars. The red car can travel at double the speed of the orange one, but the orange one travels at a speed of 92 miles an hour.

{"text": "There are 20+20*20% = 3.2 total different color marbles inside that box.\n\n### Rationale\nSolving for the answer is actually pretty simple. We are given that there are three times the number of green marble, since we know the marbles are divided into 4 colors. If we multiply 20/4 = 5 by this amount, we see that there are an additional 75 marbles. As we also know that the total amount of marbles totals 3 times the amount of green marbles, we calculate that the sum of yellow + red + blue = (3*5) + 20\n\nIf we solve for the equation, we can get to 177 + 20= 197 marbles that total up to more than three green marbles. Now, we just need to figure out how many marbles are a different color. \n\nWe can conclude that there are at least 75 marbles of a different color since we know the amount of green marble. If we take 75+20, however, we know for a fact the marbles of a different colors do not total the amount of green marbels. Therefore, marbles of a different colored must total less than 75. The final number must be less than or equal to 75.\n\nTo add to this, we know there are 20+5 = 25 red marbles that do not fall into the group of green. This gives us that the number of marbles of a different type has to be above 75-25 = 50. We are also shown this figure in question 4.\n\nGiven the constraints of information, the final question is asking us to find whether less than or equal to the number of marbles that are a different color is 177 or 198.", "answer": " 88"}

The question doesn\u2019t provide an actual price, so let\u2019s plug in some numbers to get the difference between the two options: If the $ amount for store is 950, then the store A would sell $950 - ($950 * 6 % ) = $ 897 and Store B would sell \u20ac920 - (\u20ac920 * 5 % ) = \u20ac892. \nStep 4. According to this calculation, Store B is slightly cheaper than Store A because is it sells for \u20ac892 but we buy it for only \u20ac890. \nThat's how we solve arithmetic questions, and Store B is the best option of the two.\n\n### Example:\nStep 1: 7 + 5 = 12, so the answer is A.\nStep 2 - 3: Since options A, B and C are all different, we can't eliminate anything. Now we need to plug in values to the equation to get the correct answer. We know that both X and Y are greater than or equal to 0, so we use them as variables. \nStep 3 - 4: So, let's plug in some numbers. If Y = 0, which means 'less than 0', then X * 1.5(0 + Y) = X * 1. Y * -1.5(Y + X) = Y. From now on, we will assume that X is always greater than Y (because both variables are variables, so they can be bigger or smaller than each other). If X = 0, then Y = 0, so Y * 1.500 = Y. If X = 3, then Y = 3 -", "answer": " 19"}

Choice A cannot be correct because it does not say 30 more. It only explicitly points out 30 chocolates, so we can eliminate that choice.  Choice E can also be eliminated for the same reason. \n- Choice B cannot be correct because it is a countable noun, whereas choices A, C and E are uncountable nouns.

Choice C can be eliminated for the reason that you would say \"30 chocolatos and more\", not \"30 chocolaits more\".

The problem asks us to figure out which of several people is the oldest. \n\n2. The sentence gives us two pieces of information: 1. Brenda is 12 and a half years old, and 2. Beverly is two and a half \n\nyears younger than Brenda. \n\n3. We know that a half-year is six months, so, combined with the age information, we can figure out that Brenda is 13 years and 6 months old. \n\n4. Beverly: She is half-a-year younger than Brenda, so she must be 12 years, 6 months old.\n\n5. We can figure out how much time has passed between Brenda's age and Beverly's age by subtracting a half-year from each. \n\n6. Brenda's age is 12 years, and 6 months. \n\n7. By subtracting a half-a-year from the \n\n8. we obtain that: 13 years, 6 months + \n\n6 months = 13 years, and 6 \n\nmonths = 13 years and a half year old.\n\n1,000 of something divided by 615 is what times 6.

Therefore, Tylor has 12 CDs.\n\nAdd 1.\n13.\nSubtract 7.\nThe result is still his original number of CDS.\n\n### Input; If x is 15 more than y, what is the difference between x and y?\n\n### Solution: 25.\n\n### Justification:\nFirst we add the x to 15. \n\nNext we add 15 to y.\nThen we subtract the x to y.\nThe result is x - y = 25.\nThen we subtract y from x.\nThe result is y \u2013 x = 13.\nFinally we divide 13 by 2. The result is 6.5.\n\n## Contributors:", "answer": " 22"}

The sentence states that 40% of students have elected to learn at home (learned from home) during the pandemic period.\n2. Of the remaining students, they are further divided into two equal groups.\n3. One of the groups that has elected to learn online is physically in school each day.\n4. The second group has no-one in school physically, hence every student is physically in there on any day.\n5. The correct answer is that **25%** of students are actually in school on any day, because every student is present in school.\n\nRationale:\n\n### Reminders:\n1. The phrase 'on any day' means any time that we are thinking of in relation to the sentence in the question.\n2. This implies that the first group of students (i.e. the online learners) are present on any day.\n3. We know that we are counting students physically present in school, because 'present in school' is mentioned previously.\n4. The only remaining physical students who are not in school each day, are those who have opted for physical school.\n5. Hence, the only possible response is 25%, because 40% x the no. of students present in school = 25% students physically present in the school\n\n### Input 2:\n25% of the students present in school are physically in school.

So the answer is $8 $. \n\n### Answer: Jack has $100 remaining.\n\n### How: We have to put money in the supermarket to buy things. And after we buy those things, we subtract the total price of the product that we buy with money.\n\n### Input \"John has a pet which is either a turtle or a rabbit. John does not take him everywhere he goes but he does not lock him in a cage all the time.

John's pet is cared for by someone else when he does not take him. What animal is John's pet?\"\n\n### Answer \"John's pet is a rabbit.\"\n\n### Why:\n1. The question is: John has a pet which is a rabbit or turtle. What is the animal's name?\n2. Now we notice that the word \"a\" should be changed to \"the\" which implies that there is only one.\n3. We can easily narrow down possible possibilities by taking into account what it says: John has a pet either rabbit or turtles. Which is obviously impossible for an animal.\n4. Rabbit is the only possibility left.\n\n## Output: What", "answer": " 71"}

Choices: 1. A: frozen B: fresh C: picked D: canned E: onions\nRationales: Vegetables are all fresh and unprocessed, although sometimes frozen after being processed. Fresh and picked both describe harvest, when a plant was grown and picked. \nCanned and canned both refer to packaging options and to packaging materials. Onions are a kind of vegetable, but they're not the only vegetable that exist. \nFresh and picked would both make more sense for any vegetable, but onions specifically are often grown in their own area, and not moved to where other vegetables are.\n\n### Answer and explanation:\nAll the vegetables available for purchase are grown on someone's property, in some way, and then sold to the grocery store. They never just arrive in a truck and sit on the store's shelves. \n\nVegetables are all grown on someone's land and then sold to the store, and they get processed after they've been grown, not before or during. No vegetable is actually freshly grown with its final packaging in place.\n\nSince picking and canning are both options for what a plant is doing in real life, it's hard to rule out canned and fresh. We can, however, rule out canned and picked because picking is a thing that happens before canning. \nCanned or picked make sense in this context, so we'll choose pick.\nAnswer: D. pick\n\n### Input -\nIf a car has a driver, then who is driving it?\n\n### Correct -\nIt is the car\n\n### Rationale\nThe statement refers to the car as a whole, and not to one of", "answer": " 300"}

{"text": "Let y represent the number of total birds in the cage before the 10 minutes. Since the number of remaining birds in the cage after 10 minutes equals y/2, we need to find y, which allows us to solve this task.\n\nInitially, the number of grey birds (x) in the cage is given as 40 and the number of white birds (y) next to the cage is given to be 6. Thus, 54 = x + y. Furthermore, it is given that there are 40 grey birds in the caged, thus, 40 = x. Given that we are to find y (the total number of birds in the cage), we can express it as y = x \u2013 40.\n\nAdditionally, the question states that initially, there are 6 more white birds next to the cage than grey birds. Since there are 6 more, 6 + x = 6 + x, thus, 6 + 40 = x, or x = 46. Together, we have x = 46, and y = 46 \u2013 40 = 6. This means that initially, there are a total of 6 more white birds than grey birds which are all present inside the enclosure.\n\nBy the 10 minute mark, since half of the total number of birds have been freed and flown away, x = y + (x \u2013 y) = 46 \u2013 (46 \u2013 46), or 0, which is equivalent to half of the caged birds leaving. This means that there are 33 birds remaining after 10 minutes. However, since initially there were 6 more white birds in the cage than grey, there are more than just 33 remaining because we have to subtract that as well.

So, the house needs 10 shingles by 1 ft (20 ft) which would give 20 shingles by one foot.\n\nThe total area of a 20 ft x 20 ft rectangle is 400 sq ft. One foot is 12 inches. 20 ft by 12 inches equals 240 inches.\n\nSo, 10 shingle by 1 ft (per house) plus 240 inches of the 69 sq ft of shingle needed for the porch is equal to 106.905 (rounded to the nearest 0.01) square ft. The 6.905 is how the last 0.5 sq ft is rounded off to the nearest. \n\nSo, 66.1 sq ft of shingling are needed for the porch and 40.35 sq ft of shinging are needed for the house.\n\n106.2 square feet is the answer.", "answer": " 232"}

The question states that the cost of 2 sets of towels (6 items) for the guest bathroom is 40.04 dollars.\n2. The question further states that the cost (of 12 items - 6 x 2) for the ma\n\nst room is 50 dollars.\n3. Hence, Bailey needs to spend 812 (= 6 + 6) dollars on towels.\n4. The store's discount is 20% of the total amount spent so Bailey's discount is: 1 - 0.20 = 0.8\n5. The discount is on the total amount spent not the individual cost of towels.\n6. Hence, Bailey will need to spend:\n812*0.8 dollars on towel sets to get 20% discount.\n7. Multiplying (812 x 0.8), the answer is $ 61.28.\n8. Since the question is looking for the total spent, we add the total cost of the towels (in our case 6 sets) to get $ 61.40.\n9.

The answer is option F: 2 because there are 2 books in the box. \n\n## Input: Which of the following does the writer tell the reader in the first sentence? Choices:A: that the writer is boredB: that the writer has lost his keyC: that the writer has forgotten to take his coat to collegeD: that the writer was tiredE: that the writer has been reading his notes\n\n### Choice:\nA: that the writer has not been bored all summer but has in fact had a wonderfully happy time\n\n### Rationales:\n1. The writer says 'That I have been bored all summer, and have lived out of books as a result, is shown by the fact  that my library has almost run out', he says that he has been bored since the summer and he cannot use his books like he used to.\n2. The meaning of these words is not related to the question, so we can cross them out.\n3. The rest of the choices sound similar to my answer choice, and one of them should be true.\n4. My answer choice 'that the writer has not been  bored all summer but  actually has had a wonderfully happy  time' makes sense because in the rest of the paragraph he says that he hated being lazy during summer vacation but finally he has started enjoying his vacation", "answer": " 28"}

{"text": "Ryan had his party, and Taylor had hers.  It makes no sense to \"combine\" these two things \u2014 there are no unspecific individuals who were invited to both events.  That being said, we can tell the number of guests at both parties based upon the clues.  For Taylor's party, the clue is \"four times as huge\" than just the number of people at her birthday party.  We plug in the clue to find the answer:\n\n\t240 * 4 \n\nand we get \\(2 = 960 \\).  We divide this by four, and the answer is equal to \\(225\\).  The answer in this context is how MANY MORE people were at Ryan's party, but the original question was what the number of people at Ryan's party was, so we subtract twenty-five to get twenty-one-fifty: (215)\n\nInput: When you're a tourist, a what is a must-do item to fill your schedule? Choices:  I) See the zoo II) Hangout with friends III) Going to the beach IV) Go sight-seeing\nRationales:  1. The question asks us \"what is a must-do tourist activity\".\n2. The question does not imply any restriction on type of tourist, but rather provides a set of potential activities anyone could reasonably do.\n3. This leads us to consider the answer choices.\n4. Both \"seeing the zoo\" and \"going to the beach\" all refer to particular locations. They are a particular activity an individual can participate in.\n5. However, neither of these activities require anything beyond simply traveling to a particular destination.\n6. Similarly, \"going sight-seeing\" does not necessitate a set tourist agenda. It can be done on your own, and does not require any specific location to be visited.\n7. That leaves \"going out with your friends\", which is the clear only response choice that matches what a tourist \"must\" do, since it involves planning activities, socializing with other people, and requires a bit of flexibility to visit a variety of different locations.\nAnswer: IV) Go sight- seeing\n\n### Input\n\n\n\nInput:What is found in the darkest and lowest section of the ocean, where many fish are not able", "answer": " 192"}
{"text": "A) 42 B) 137 C) 41 D) 8 E) none of these\n\n### Demostration:\nAnswer: (B) 41\n\nStep 1: Johann (person) - Person + friend (plural) - plural + friend (plural)- friend (plural) = 1 person + 2 people\n\nStep 2: We know we're trying to find how many pieces Johann needs to help with...\nStep 2A: We also know Johann can't help with the whole stack of certified mail by himself. This is because it's not given in the question.\nStep 2B: We know that Johann and his friends collectively can deliver the whole stack of certifie mail. This is because they are collectively told to deliver the whole stack of mail. \nStep 2C: So, if we plug this into the equation we came up with in Step 1: 1 person + 1 person + 0 person = 1 person * 137 pieces of mail\n\nStep 2D: Therefore, we arrive at B. The number of pieces of mail Johann needs to help with is 137.

{"text": "She will divide 20 muffin bakes between herself and her four friends, equally sharing 20 muffine bakes. Each person will receive five bakes.\n\n### Rationale: The question is asking us how many muffins each person will get.\n\nThe person being invited, Jesse, is the one that will get the whole number of muffins (20).\n\nWe are told to divide the muffins, and we are asked how many each person will get. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of muffins between the number of people, so that each person receives something different.\n\nThere are 5 people total, so we divide the 20 muffies between the 5 people to get the 5 muffins that would be given to each person.\n\n### Input.

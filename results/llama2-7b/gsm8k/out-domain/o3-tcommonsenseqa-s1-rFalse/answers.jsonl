The program looped until it completed counting and displayed how many pennies there were. Each iteration added all the pennies for that iteration to the total. The student wrote a test program that performed the following task. She started a program, ran it, input in 30 pennies, and then copied and pasted the contents of the standard output to a text edit page called PENNE. After the test run, she displayed the original source of the program in the text edit and examined the program. She saw that the penny count was 55 and the number of iterations were 30. She observed that the program had performed well, but that there were pennies missing from the count. She changed the program so that it would input 60 pennies instead of 30 and then ran it. This time, she saved the output on a data page called PENNE_60 and copied and pasted the data onto the data edit page. She again observed that the count was wrong, even though it was higher than before. She changed the program again to input 55 pennies and then ran it, saving on its standard output with the letter PENNE and copying and pasting the output on to the data edit page. This time, she observed that the count was correct.

The correct answer is B, because plumbing is not of use to me if I am thirsty(because in every house, there must be a water faucet, which can be used to drink).\n\n2. The correct answer is A, because as the statement says, \" when a person is beginning work \", the person has not worked yet, therefore the person lacks  accomplishing.\n\n3. The correct answer is D, because if the statement says \" I lost my pen, where might I find pens of a company logo? \", it means the pens are only in the companies.\n\n4. The correct answer is C, in this question, the value of x, can be computed by following operations, $10 + 3x + 8 = 30, which can be rewritten as $10 + (3x + 8) = 30, and we subtract 10 from each side, thus yielding $10 + 4x + 2x = 30, now we divide each side by 2, thus yielding $5 + ( 2*x) = 15, and then substract 5 from each side to  yield $5 -2*x = 15, now we multiply each side by 2 to reveal  $10 - 4*x = 10, we subtract 4*x from both sides, to yield $10 - 20x = -10, finally, solve by  variable for x, $10 + ( 2*4) - (9/2) = 15 -->20x = 9, thus  x = 45/9.\n\n\n\n### Run the code\n```bash\n$ java 10_questions -file hello_world_questions.txt\nInput: You drive your car for 9 hours and 15 minutes.

This is represented as a partition in set notation.\n\n$$\\{1, 2, 3, 4\\}$$\n\nThis means that each person can do the job in minimum 1 unit of time, and the sum of the parts will be equal to the minimum number of plumbing in the set.\n\n$$\\{2, 2, 4\\} \\cup \\{4 \\} \\cup \\{3,3\\} \\cup \\{1, 1\\} \\cup \\{1\\} = 4$$\n\n### Instruction:In which problem is the", "answer": " 126"}

{"text": "The correct answer is $65,550. Here's how to get it: The 7,000 dollars added by Sheila\u2019s family is 7,008 dollars, as this addition is calculated by a monthly interest rate of 0.0854%. The total saving after 4 years, which includes Sheila\u2019s savings and her family\u2019s $7,008, equals $37,250 + 7008 = $44,258. But we also need to figure out the return of the interest rate, r. Therefore, IMPORTANT TIP: You will receive 854 for each interest rate. Therefore, there are 4491/0.08554=5162 months from 4 to 5162, and $ 37,258+ 5162 \u00d7 7008 dollars will be more than $ 44,250.\n\nInput: How are these two lines that are parallel equal to?

The same thing, you have a straight horizontal line, and a straight vertical downward line. 2 is 8 and 9. The two are different because you have two straight horizontal lines, one at an angle of 45 degrees, and a straight vertical line. Here are the math calculations:\n1.

If a sharpener breaks, it won't matter to her if she has to go without pencils for a little while, because she has always had pencils before.

The girl wants to find out if her grandmother would prefer a meal with less fat than before. But the girl did not know what kind of fats her grandmother used to eat. So she went to the butcher's to see if they could help. There at the butcher's they have a lot of charts that show kinds of fats, such as, butter, lard, and fat from meat, and these show both grams of calories and of fat. The butcher's was out of the charts for fat from meat and told her to try their counter to see what they had. At the counter her grandmother said she used to eat 3 kinds of fat instead. She said she used to eat butter, but she got sick from it because she was taking lots of vitamins. Then she said she used to eat lard, but she got sick of it because her granddaughter was eating the butter. She did not go on. The granddaughter made an educated guess and said \"Well I think the third fat you used to use was chicken fat that came with the skin and was called schmaltz?\" The grandmother didn't know. \"How about duck fat?\" asked the granddaughter. The grandmother thought and said \"Well that is an idea but I never heard that one before.\" And she was right but the little girl would not give up. Finally in a raid on all kinds of canned food it came out that the grandmother liked salmon but not the salmon itself but the oil from the fish. The granddaughters guessed butter, lard and canned pork and beef fats were the only ones left but knew they were all wrong. The grandmother admitted eating canned salmon instead of butter but she had not used lard to get fat. Finally Grandmother said \"Yes it is canned salmon, but there is a lot of other ways that I get fat!\" The last guess was that she got fat from being a very busy woman and she was right.\nOutput:  D: canned salmon\n\nInput: In which of the following situations is it more appropriate to spell something out?

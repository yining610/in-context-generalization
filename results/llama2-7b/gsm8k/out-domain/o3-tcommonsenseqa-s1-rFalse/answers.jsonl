What is 4863 + 6764.\n\nAdd the hundreds. Your answer should be 48 + 67.\n\nAdd the tens. Your answer should be (4 + 7) (add each group) Your answer should be 130.\n\nAdd the fives. Your answer should be add the 8 and 6 and 14.\n\nAdd your two groups. 130 + 14 = 144.\n\n### Vertical addition\n\nLet's practice vertical addition.\n\nLet' work with an example. We'll add 166 + 6879.\n\nFirst group: Add the hundreds. (16 + 6) We get 22. \n\nSecond group: Add the tens. (thousands) We get 68.\n\nThird group: Do the same as step 1. We get 80.\n\nSo, (thousands) + (hundreds) + (tens) = 22 + 68 + 80 = 170.\n\nWe can use either a vertical or horizontal method!\n\n### Subtraction\n\nIn order to subtract positive numbers, we must combine the numbers with the one's digit first. \nWe can't just ignore the ones digit and just subtract the ones.\n\nLet' look at an example. 6067 - 3465\n\nFirst we add 3 + 4", "answer": " 400"}

He score 4 touchdowns each game.  He scores a 2 point conversion each time.  There are 35 points in each touchdown.  There are 200 points to the game.  What is the total points James score?\nDemonstration:A: First we begin with the information of the game.  A football game has 4 touchdowns x 35 points = 140 points and then 6 conversions x 6 points added on to that.  6 x 6 = 36 points added on = 176 points.  Then we just add up to our start point which is 140 points + 176 points which equals 316 points and take away from our start point.  316 points - 140 points = 176.\n\nOutput: 316 - 140 = 176\n\n### Feedback:", "answer": " 72"}

{"text": "Answer is $12.\n\n### Input(continued):Each year, he gives 2 apples to 4 relatives.  How many trees must he plant to do that? He planted a total of n trees, so n trees gives 2 n apples per year.  So his total apples per year is 2 n.  His money earned each year from selling apples is $2 n.  We can't directly find $2 n because n doesn't give a number with a dollar sign at the end, so I did this.  We need 2 n of n, so that is $2 n x n.  But that gives $2 n 2n, not $2 n, so we need to divide by 2 to get $2 n.  Now we can add up his apples per year ($2 n) and divide it by 2 (because the amount of years that he has been planting trees).  Since n and n = 3, and n = 4, the total apples for 3 trees equals 6 apples, so his income from the apples per year are $6.  We can then add $6 to $6, because he has been planting 2 n for 2 years, to get $12.", "answer": " 30"}

{"text": "$21.00\n### Challenge:\nDesign an algorithm that can help you identify and respond to a person who wishes to have a conversation.\n\n### Challenge Solution:\nThis is a tricky problem, and is almost the inverse of the previous problem. Since we want to have a conversation we are basically just trying to keep the person from talking\n\nFirst step is to get the program started by getting the user input for the program. When the program is started it then needs to check if the person is talking. The program then asks the user if it would like to end conversation (if they do and say no then move to the end of the loop). This is where the program needs to identify (and then repeat if yes) if the person is talking\n\nFirst test is to test if the person says something. If the person says something the loop end and if the person does not say something the program needs to identify if the person wants to keep talking or not. If it would like to keep talking the program needs to wait for a response from the user and test it the program needs to move into the check if the person wants to continue talking. When the program reaches that point and the conversation is started it needs to create a new loop for itself and repeat.\n\n\n\n### Solution\n![](./ReadMeAssets/ConvoSol1.png)", "answer": " 135"}

{"text": "The answer is 13.\n\n### Justification:\nLard shares a pizza with his best buddy jelly.\n\nLard grabs a whole, uncut pizza and slices it in half.\n\nThe two slices become two pieces.\n\nLard cut each piece in half to get the number of pieces. This gives up a piece number of four. \n\nLard take the fourth slice out, then take the third slice. This gives the fifth piece. \n\nLater on, the sixth piece take out the seventh piece and so on.\n\n### Lard ends up with a whole pizza. So he cut each pizza in half. To make eight pieces. \n\nLord cut them into six pieces. This gives him and Jelly five pieces each. They each receive one of the remaining pieces.  Lard's first piece drops because his friend drops it (12-1=11).\n\nLard's first slice is cut into three. This results in 3 pieces of that whole pizza. This makes 12.\n\n### The final step: Lard's last slice is 5 divided by 2 which equals 2.5, so there's three pieces. \n\nWe put together like 12 pieces, then divide it in half. This makes a total of 5 pieces on Lard's whole pizza. \n\nNext, we divide these five pieces in half. We arrive at  8.75 pieces. \n\nThe final step: Lard gives Jelly five pieces. This leaves him with three pieces to give someone else.", "answer": " 9"}

{"text": "#### Solution:\n\nFirst, we need to solve for the number of vampire themed bags and pumpkin themed bags purchased individually to satisfy the needs of the kids.\n\nTo solve for the number of bags purchased individually we first use the distributive property of multiplication over addition to get the total number per bag. The total number per bag is 3, the number of themes purchased individually. Then we multiply that by the vampire bag percentage 11/25 and the pumpkin bag percentage 14/25.\n\nVampire bag percentage: 11/24 = 0.45\nPumpkin bag percentage: 14/24 = 58.33\n\n108 kids\n\n\\(108 \\times 0.45 * 3 = 14.72\\) (individual vampire themed)\n\nSince the kids all asked for the vampire bag, then the teacher will buy them all.\n\n\\(14.72 kids * 3 packs $3 = 44.26\\) (\\(3*3*3\\) from the distributive property of muliplication over addition)\n\nPumpkin bag\n\n\\(130.67 kids * 3packs $3 = 272.21\\) (from distributive property of multiplication over addition)\nPumpkin bag individually : \\(272.20 - 272.19 =.01\\)\n\n\\(262.21 - 44.25 = \\text{ $218.96$ }\\)\n\n#### Discussion:If possible, suggest an alternate solution.\n\nWhen purchasing the bags individually, you can buy less than 3 bags and still satisfy all kids wants.

What is the difference between doing a problem and providing a demonstration.\n  - A demonstration is a detailed step by step explanation of how you arrive at an answer to a question. (eg. 1+2=3) and 1+1=2,so 1+1+1=2+2+1=5) a demonstration is also useful when showing how to do complicated math questions where you are uncertain of if you or your partner is correct (eg. 4^5=16) so I write down each step after multiplying something by a number and write down 16^2=256)\n  A problem is just simply asking a question.\n2. Why can you provide a demonstration if there is a calculator.\n  - I can give a demonstration because i know the answer is going to be correct or there was a simple step (eg.3/3=1)\n3. Do you think that when your demonstrating, that you are less likely to make a mistake when doing a problem.\n  - I think that i am less likely to make mistakes because when I'm demonstrating, this is the only chance to show that I'm correct because it seems like every partner you have is always wrong. This means I am extra conscious about whether i am correct or not because the answer has to be correct when i am writing.\n4. If you were doing a simple question where you didn't think you needed to demonstrate such as 1 + 2=3. Would you still do the demonstration?\n  - I would still do the demonstration because it just shows the person I am", "answer": " 40"}

{"text": "The student council should make $100 in total. Each eraser is sold for 75 cents, so each box of erasers is worth $6.75. There are 2 boxes in each box, so there are a total of 0.75 boxes or 1.5 boxes in each box. We multiply all units of erasers by 0.75 to get the price per unit. So to find the amount of erasers, we multiply 6.75 by the number of units sold. This is 6.75*1.5 or 10.25. We then multiply this amount of erasers by the price per eraser. This is 10.26 * 0.75 $/eraser. We then multiply all of this by the total amount of erasers so to find the total amount of money, we multiply 102.6*0.75 and the result is 76.55, which in total is $100.\n\n### Input : You want to help a local school with a fundraiser to help the school buy some equipment. With the help of your peers, you decide to sell carnations as a fundraiser. Your peers are able to find six boxes of carnations, each box has ten carnations. You decide you will sell the carnations for $5.00 a unit. Your group meets to discuss ways to advertise the fundraiser. Your teacher asks you, \u201cHow much money do you think you will make from the fundraiser?\n\n###Response:The group's total amount of money will be $45. Because each box contains 10 carnations, multiplying 6 by 10 gives us 60. Thus each box has 60 carnations in it. We then multiply 60 by $5 to get $300 before taxes. Then to account for taxes, you multiply by 16.5 which equals $49 as in $300*16.5 and then you round the final price to $50.\n\n## License\nThis work is licensed under the [creative commons BY-SA 3.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0)", "answer": " 864"}

{"text": "163.75 pounds  \nExample Answer:   \nIf a dog eats 5 pounds of food twice a day then each dog eats 5 x 2 = 10 pounds of food a day  \nIf the puppies eat 2 ounces 3 times each day, each pup then eats 2 x 3 = 6 ounces of food per day.  \nSo, if the dogs eat 10 pounds of dog food per day and the puppies eat a grand total of 6 pounds then each puppy gets an additional 4 ounces of food that day which adds up to a total of 16 ounces for each puppy or 2 pounds of food per day for each puppy.  \nSubtract the daily amount of food each dog eats (10 pounds) from the total amount of food puppies AND dogs eat in a day (6 x 10 = 60 pounds) and you are left with 60 minus 10 = 50 pounds left for puppies  \nSo, puppies get 50 pounds of food per day.

{"text": "### Demonstraion:Solution:\nThe number of points Paislee must achieve to tie Calvin will be equal to one more than the product of 500 times the fraction  3/4. Thus,  the needed number of points will be the product of 5 times the fraction 3/4. The number of points will be 10 x\n4 times the  3/4.\n### Demonstation:\nThe fractional representation of 10 x  (4 times the fraction 3 over 4) is found with the division of the number of points Calvlin won(500) by the product of (3/4) divided by two. Thus, the number of points equals 10 x 4 times the fraction 9/8.\nThe fraction 9/8 can be reduced to 1/16.

{"text": "The best-selling book is \"TOP,\" which costs $8. The most sold book last week at a certain bookstore is \"TOP\" ($8). The cheapest book sold last week at the certain bookstore is \"ABC\" ($23).\n\n### Response Cont'd\nThe four cheapest books that were sold costs $23, which means that there are total of four \"ABC\" or less cheapest books that were solde. Since there are four \"ABC\" books that were sold, we know that $23 X 4 = 92, which means that $23 was earned four times. Since the four cheapest books cost $23 then that means that they will be sold 3 times. So, the difference of the total sales of the two books is $8-$23=$15. This means $15 was earned from each cheapest book. So, the total amount earned from $15 times 4 which equals $60. This means that there was $60 earned by the bookstore from the most sold book last year.\n\nYou are not required to provide an explanation, just answer the question itself", "answer": " 12"}

{"text": "Input:I'll be twice my brothers age in ten years. The sum of our age at that time is 45 years.

How old will my brother's be then.`\n\n### Response\n```\nMy brother's age + I's age is equal to 51 years old in 3 years.

How old is my father?`\n\n### Response \n```\nI know my son's age (let's call that n). I'm n + 1/3 of n.\n1/3 of n = my father's age.\nn = 1/3 of (n + 1/3):\n     My father's age = n (I can substitute in my son's age n for \n                         my father's age and use the above equation\n                        for my son's age. \n\n        My age = 2/3 of my son's age + 1/3\n        \n```\n\n```\nSo my father's age, my son's age, and I's age is 1 5 times my sons age plus 1 2/3 times my son's age plus 1/3 \nSo my son's age is 5 2/3\nAnd my age is 3/3 of 5 2/13\nSo my age is 5\nSo my father is 35 years old.\n```", "answer": " 20"}

I was at my office for several days. I left the office with the key when I went to the truck that was on the street. I parked the truck on a hill facing the side of the street that was up a incline.

It is raining a lot. When it rains, everything runs down hill after the rain.

Bobbie has 2 less letters if she takes 2 away from her last name. Jamie\u2019s last name is Jam. So if Bobbie takes two letters from her last name, she has a last name like Jamie's, just the letters on the right side of the name are missing.\n\n* For Samantha\n* - 3 letters will be deleted (2,4,6)\n* For Bobbie\n* - 2 letters will be deleted\n* If we subtract all these letters from Samantha, we will have 6 letters. This gives us the correct answer.\n\nWe can simplify the problem using mathematical language.\n\n* 10 letters - 3 letters = 7 letters\n* 9 letters - 2 letters = 7 letters remaining\n* 8 letters - 2 letters - 3 letters equal 3 letters remaining.

This letter can also be the first letter of a new name.\n\nAn example of one possible answer is \"Q\". Q can be used to replace any other letter in the alphabet.

{"text": "Ann, Bill, Bill, and cate each buy personal pan pizza cut into 4 pieces, they each eat 50% but bill and cate split 1/2 of the left pizzas, so that is 4/2 = 2 pizzas. Bill gets 2/5 of his pizza which is 1/3 of a pizza. Ann and Dale both split cate and bills half leaving 1/2 of Dale and 1/4 of Ann, That leaves 1/4 of Dale and 3/8 of ann. This means that there are 14 pizza pieces left uneaten as 50% equals 2/5 and 75% equals 3/8.\n\n### Solution:\nEach person pays for 1/4th of the entire pizza. It's split four ways, so each person gets a fourth. We want to know what this fourth is and how many there are left over.\n\nThis is the simplest problem to solve, so to start, I decided to take the number of slices. There was a personal pan pizza. For every slice sold, the restaurant makes money. If you have a pizza of a size that has 8 slices in a single pizza, the restaurant makes 4 extra dollars when a total of 8 are sold. You don't get more than the money. A pizza with 8 slices, and if Bill and Dale split each other's pizzas, and the pizza, and you buy a personal pan pizza, for every one that someone eats, the store is making 8 dollars.

{"text": "There are some lions in London at first\n\n### Analysis: I want to try a different method in this task for analyzing it. The analysis is to find the pattern to see whether this task is a pattern matching. It turned out that every question can be divided into two parts: (a) The context of the question (b) An answer.\n\n### Pattern matching:\n\nThis is the third question and my interpretation of the meaning of the word \"some\" in every question. The problem is which number can we interpret to? 5? 6? 14? 50? In the case that 5 per month, 1 per month is small enough, 5 will be chosen.\n\n### Solution:\nI have the answer in mind, since I do not know how to answer the question like most children. I know: \"There are some lions... at first\"\n\nA question is a word or a group of words that shows which information we want it to show and which information we are not required to show. I know the question for the answer 148 in the fifth question: How many lions are born in the first year?\n\nAnswering all of them is a little bit like rote learning. I know the answer for the fifth question because I know the answer for all the previous questions.\n\n### Analysis for the fifth question:\n\nWe need to find the pattern to get the answer to the fifth question. If you follow the instructions, you can find the pattern:\n\n* \n  * We do not care about the answer to the first question\n  * \"the fifth question\" here is the answer to the question we are working on\n\nThe following is what I want to tell you from the fifth step.\n\nThe word \"some\" in this is used to express the number of the first group. (Not 5 or 148. It is a group of animals. In other words, the word \"some\" is not just for us to represent the animal's number). The word \"lions\" is used to represent the animals of the first group. 148 is the total number of the group.\n\nI am not sure if I understand right or wrong. This may be a pattern. However, I think that the task is in English. So, I will not try it again.", "answer": " 100"}

Therefore 205% + 5/12*220 equal 204 guests attend the wedding.\n\n### Input.Melissa is planning her wedding.. She expects 200 people to attend the Wedding, but she has told that approximately 6% typically don't go. How many people will attend her wedding?\n### Response: Melissa will have 64 guests attend the wedninng. The formula for determinding how many guests will go to the wedding is: guests (%) is multiplied by 100, which equals 200 guests will go to the Wedding.

{"text": "Carl will put 50 marbles in the jar after his game.\n\n### Input : I had a dream that I was a teacher. I had six students. I was in my room. I had some paper, but I could not write on this paper. I decided to play a game, and I took out my marbles as I started the game. I put all the marbles into the first jar. All my students had marbles in their jars. I needed to buy some more papers so I could write. I went to the store, and I bought four new papers. I added marbles to each of my students\u2019 jars. Each student added 6 more marbles to all their jars until they were all full. I then played the game again. There were 63 more marbles in all our jars. I made six tables, and I gave each student 12 marbles and took 13 marbles from them to make the tables. This process was repeated. Then, I added all these marbles, which were in the tables, to my jar. There were 40 marbles that were in the 6 tables, and I added 6 marbles to 1 student\u2019s jar. Then, all my students played on this game again, and they added another 28 marbles each. After that, there were 25 marbles left after this exercise again. Then, I told my friend to give me 11 marbles and he gave me 18 marbles and took the 7 marbles from my jar.

What is this number?\n\n### Output\n\n6\n\n### Rational:\n\nThe number 24 has three parts. There are 24 and then a number that we do not know of yet has been added to the right. This number was 10. So, we can write it as 24+10. It is also possible to write it as 2 x 12. The fraction we just calculated was 2/12 of 24. Using our fraction equation, we can write it this way: (2/12) x 24 = 6.\n\n### Note\n\nIn Grade 4, we will look at some problems that require students to apply the math skills they have already learned. For example, in Grade 4, students calculate the units that represent different quantities. They also learn how to use different kinds of unit blocks to estimate the amount of quantity needed for building projects. They can also read and write numbers to express a given quantity in different ways.\n\nThis grade has a lot of homework.\n\n### Author:Stephen J. Wallace", "answer": " 20"}

So how long is the task going to be when you multiply the number of bags by the amount by which you are multiplying it 20 bags x 1000 = 20000 total\n### Output \uf0e0 The task is going to take 2000 hours to complete.\n### Exaplanation: The number of hours can be determined by the time when you multiply the amount of bags by the weight.\n\n### Input-It's the day before the new years again and the boss tells me", "answer": " 100"}

{"text": "26.666666\n\n### Explanation:\n\nMelissa needs 56 / 4 = 14 square meters of fabric per dress. Assuming the number of hours she spends making each dress is constant, she can make 14 / 3 = 4.66667 dresses an hour.\n\n\nThe working hours could be calculated by using the following formula:\n\nNumber of dresses / time (in hours) = Number of working hours\n\n56 / 4.66 = 12 hours working\n\nWe only need to find out the number of working hours.\n\n\nThe question asks about how many hours could she work to finish the project. In this case, the formula is as follows:\n\nNumber of working hours = 4.67 hours * 12 = 55.47 hours\n\nThen, we get 55.467 hours, which is equal to 12.2233 hours multiplied by 4.667\n\nIn both cases, the working hours total 26.67 hours.\n\n### Author:Liu Yu", "answer": " 42"}

{"text": "In the given information we have, we cannot accurately calculate how much time it will take because there are not specific times on each task. Also, we do not know exactly how long it takes for Trey to do the things on his list. So we cannot accurately find out how long it will take to clean the house, or how long it will take or shower. And we cannot find out how long it takes for him to prepare his meal. Therefore, we cannot calculate how much time it takes to complete everything on Trey' s list, without further instructions.\n\n### Rationale:\n-\"we have\"-The use of the demonstrative pronoun we refers to the fact that either the student, or the professor, has this list. We cannot assume either. \n-\"to calculate\"-The verb to calculate implies there is a formula in math that we can use to solve. \n-\"how long it will take\"-The word take is missing information, it may not use the same meaning. \n-\"accurately\"-The adjective accurately, suggests there is an accurate way to solve the question. We would only know if the calculation is accurate based on the type of formula we apply. \n-\"Trey's list\"-There are no instructions to write the answer with the word list. Without more clear directions we cannot assume that the answer to this question is the list and we can't assume Trey means his list. \n-\"take 10 minutes\"-The question and the demonstration states\" 1 thing to do\" we know there should be some kind of formula to calculate how much time those items take. \n-\"it will take\"-Since the question doesn't have more information or instructions, we cannot assume the word \"It\" is referring to the list. \n-The number \" 10 minutes\"  could also refer to 10 items (10 things to do) \n\n### Rational for Edit: \nThe instructions on Question 3 are different from Question 2 and the explanation to Question 3 is different than Question 2. \n\n### Recommendation: \nI recommend including the explanation from Question 2 for questions 3&4 and use similar questions for the other explanations.  \n\n### Revision: \nInput: Where might you find plumbing that would", "answer": " 2"}

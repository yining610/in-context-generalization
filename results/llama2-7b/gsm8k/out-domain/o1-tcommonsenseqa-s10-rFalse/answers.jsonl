{"text": "If the guy is smart, the answer is \"$26,500.\"\n\n### Explanation: \n\nThe response: Tom wants to make the world\u2019s largest dough ball and wants to make it happen in a matter of days.  The world's largest bread dough was created in Australia.  The record-breaking doughball weighed only 65 lbs  This was created in a matter of days and that did not mean that the man was able to sleep or eat.  He probably missed some meals or had them late because he was up creating the dough ball.  The fact that it broke a record that was created 13 years earlier shows that it is likely that he spent a lot to gain recognition.  My guess is that he spent a lot of money on decorations and such. \n\nHow much money did he spend? In total, the guy spent a total of $3585.00 which included $2700 for food, $585 for ingredients and $35 for a new measuring cup. \n\nThe ticket prices were $10 but that was a promotion.  The general price would be $20 each (for a ticket) and 500 tickers at the general price would give them a total of $10,000.\n\nThe question is \"How much money did he make?\"  The man earned $26,50 for a total profit of $26,550.  This, of course, doesn't include the $13,035.00 that he spent. \n\n### Credits:\n\nI found this on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSy8U-BqZy4&list=LLRMxTjzp0Vl18Mm9IYK-Uw&index=20", "answer": " 8798"}

He gets an extra point at the beginning of the game, on the first roll, for everyone who has scored a 7 in the previous game, or for each time that anyone rolled a 7 the game before. In the game, all of these are added to the players' score. Each player must put a coin in the slot, and then roll the die.

Then his mother makes 10 pies using the leftover tomatoes. Now if the rest of the tomatoes are used to make marinara sauce again and enough sauce remains to make 5 more pies, how many pies are made from the original 18 pests?\n\n### Solution:\nI have figured out how to solve the problem. The number of tomatoes in all the marinara sauce that was made from the 18 plants is equal to the number of sauces made.\nTo find the number of pies that were made, I have to find a half of the sauce produced from the 18 tomato plants. I can use half of 5.5 and end up with.5. The remainder of the sauce is 1.5 tomatoes. I am going to ask for 5 pies in a sauce.\nI need the number to multiply each time the sauce is produced.

Fortunately, he was able to put the loan from Alicia of $600 into savings before the month-end deposit came through. Unfortunately, before he was able to invest that money into the stock market and make a large profit, a hacker stole it, putting him deep in debt for the month. He calls up\n##Alicia to apologize for forgetting about paying her back in the 29th. To make matters worse, there was also a late fee for the deposit but she could go without. However, she says:\n##Response:\n\"I'll be happy to forgive you a part of the fees. I hope you have the money you need to purchase the stock. That will\n##give you the money you need to pay me.\"\n\n### [Note: Response may include a emoji]\n##[Note: Response may not include an emoji]\n[Note: Response 2 may include a emoiji]\n\n##Instruction: Answer the following grade math question", "answer": " 3900"}

If you count on a dart board in ten places where a dart lands, how many chances does each child has of getting a six-spin win if you throw the dart?\n\n### Demostration: Each child has gotten 3 and 6, so 3+6=9.\n### Response: There are two children, so there is a 50/50 chance that any one child will be winning, then there is a 5/50 * 5/50 chance that each of the two children is winning. In total there is a 51/100 chance that they both win.

B. or D.\n\nThe length of a rectangle Is 4x. if the rectangle has an area of 100 m. square. what is the length?\nAnswer: 8 m.\n\nBecause the length of a rectangle is a multiplier that is four times their area. The area is square and the length of a rectangle. You can do the following. You can do the area of the rectangle and take the inverse square. The area is 10 cm x 10 cm. You can divide the area of 3,000 or you can multiply it by 2.\n\nThe area is 3,002. You can also do the inverse of six. The inverse of six is 0.048. Therefore, if you put it all together. You can divide by 0.04 and the answer is 8 metres.\n\nThe area of a rectangle is 324 sq cm. If the rectangle Is 2 times as long as wide how wide is the rectangle?\nAnswer: 3.5 cm.\n\nThe area formula for a rectangle is 8 inches x 8 inches. The formula for the area is L x. If 8 x 8 you can get an area of 64 square inches. The inverse of 0.072. The inverse of 64 is 0.07. Therefore, if you divide by the inverse of 0.72, the answer is 0.5 inches.

You may choose two dice as long as the sum of the faces of one of the dice is greater than or equal to the sum of the faces on the other die.

The third and fourth values are choices because one has double the value of the other. Choices may be repeated, unlike non-choices.\n\nThe table goes on in this fashion, with some dice being non-choices (as indicated by a dash) because they have the same value as another dice, followed by more rules as specified. \n\nChoose a pair of dice according to the rules above and report your choices in the form shown below:\n\n*1*2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9", "answer": " 81"}

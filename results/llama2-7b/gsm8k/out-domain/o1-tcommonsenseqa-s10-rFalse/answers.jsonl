If she earns  15 $ per hour of work, calc ulate the total amount of money sh e makes from cleaning all th e floors in the building..\n\nOutput:\n24 hours * $ 15 = $3 60\n\n\nDetailed Answer:\n# The building has 4 floors with 10 rooms on each floor. Legacy is to clean all the rooms on all 4 floors and she cleans one room in 6 hours. If I give a person a job and then they find a way to do the same thing in less time then they still need to earn the same rate. So if the person is getting paid a certain rate which is 15 dollars we have to multiply it by how many hours they made the job take which is 48 hours then we will have 15x48 and it will give us back the same answer. It took 6 hours to clean each room then multiplied by how many rooms there is which is 40 rooms each floor then it would equal 72. It takes 6 hours to clean 1 room that means that one room could equal 24 hours then multiplied by 280 which gets you 72 on one floor and then that is repeated for each floor.", "answer": " 3600"}

Every number is the sum of its predecessor + 5. Write a function to return the total of the array (without iteration).\n\nOutput: 31\n\nInput: If every number in an array is even, how many numbers are there in the array?\n\nOutput: An even number is an integer that is the sum of two integers, each of which is also an integer. Therefore, for an even number, you can subtract from each integer, except to make the outcome an even integer.\nFor a smaller subset (array) of even integers, for each number in an array, subtract its previous element, so if it's an even number, then it will be even if you subtract any number in the array (which is odd).\n\nIn essence, if n(k- 1)/2 for any integer is odd, let a(i) = (a+i)(a+i-1). Now the even number of (k-1)/2 is always (k-1)/4 which is even.\n\nInput: Is the following expression true or false: \u201c(1) \u2192 \u00ac (1)\u201d\n\nOutput: This is false.

{"text": "B: 3\n\nInput:  How do I measure for two curtains at the same time?\nOutput: A: I'd start by using the formula 1 1/2 times your window height, and 1 1/4 times your window width for the width, to estimate your total curtain width. Then for the length I'd choose a length that was twice your window height. For example, if your  double hung window measures: 92 inches tall and 54 inches wide, your curtain will be 17 1/2 inches (the measurement of your window height) by 22 1/2 inches for width and length.\n\n\nInput:  What is a casing?\nOutput: A casing is a narrow channel used to keep staples and stitching from raveling out.\n\nInput: There are (5) different types of casings and each is described below:\n\n 1) Flanged casing - the casing has turned up edges to prevent raveling.\n2) Eye casing - one edge extends to one or more holes used to insert a curtain rod through. \n3) Blind casing - the blind casing prevents raveling on all sides of the window.  \n4) Beaded casing - the beaded casing has ridged edges that give a finished look to the casing.\n5) Rod ring casing - the rod ring casing is intended for a single window; there is a hole in the ring that accepts a standard curtain rod.\n\nInput:  An open weave on a curtain can add depth and intrigue. But you have to choose the correct weave for the room or the mood you need to set. A few basic guidelines from interior designers regarding open weave:\n* To set the mood for a room, pair a sheer curtain with a matching window drapes. The sheer curtain gives you a soft filter while the drapes help define the space.\n* To create the illusion of a room that is bigger than one would normally be, use sheers with small weave patterns.\n\nNow that you've finished some of the basic math problems, let's move on to the next grade math question.", "answer": " 160"}

Incorrect input-output combinations may be interpreted as having different values from the previous one, and should be considered as different from one another.\n\nFor example, let\u2019s take a look at what you should do if you\u2019re asked to answer a question regarding the number of \u201ccrystals\u201d (crystals have a value of 4) that can be filled out of 24 different \u201ccrystals\u201d. This question will not make sense if you ask yourself how many crystals you can fill out of 24 crystals. If you ask such a question, what could you do?\n\nLet's imagine our first solution. Let's say we asked how many of 24 crystal could you fill in. Let's say there are 6 left crystals and 6 empty crystals, and we choose to do one operation on our first crystal: put 3 in our first crystal. It happens when we're looking at it for the first time. We have 6 empty and 6 full crystals. The remaining three empty crystals are 2, 1. 3 and 1 respectively.\n\nIf we had asked how many of 6 crystals could we fill in (instead of 24), we would say there would be 6, 3, 1. 4, 1, 2 respectively. And we would choose 2 as the answer, because 2 was full. In this example, we didn't ask the number of \"crystals\" that could be put into 24 \"crystals\", or 6. However, the question you really asked was, \"What is the number of \"c\" that can be filled out in 24?\" If you make a mistake, you will not get the same answer. This is why this question is not allowed in this site. (We will not make it because it is not a good question).\n\nWhen you do not ask the question you are asking, and you want", "answer": " 7"}

Clothing store and sewing room cut cloth to order but they won't need a tailor shop because they cut themselves their clothes and the material is already made and sewn to the size they already made. Tailor shops cut fabrics that are already made and will need a tailor. A curtain is a type of fabric that is a material made made out of cloth, wood, plastic, fabric materials used in houses and other places.\n\n- The gummy bear factory can manufacture 300 gummies a minute. 50 Gummy bears inside each packet. Multiply 50 times 300, we get 15,000 gummy beans. 240 packets contains 24,000 gummies. Divide 15,024 by 24,024, we get 220.2 minute. Which is 220 minutes.\n\n<b>2. Answer to 0225</b>.\n\n- In a hardware store, fabrics are normally kept in the material section. Hardware stores carry many varieties of materials and can even custom cut and sew. They can sew, cut and sell many fabrics. Tailor shoppers sew fabrics according to the buyer's measurements, which is why tailor shops don't carry fabric like a hardware store. Hardware companies sell or distribute materials such as vinyl and plastic to make bags, wallets, briefcases and other things. \n\n- The gummies produced by a factory are manufactured on the assembly line. The gummy bears inside each pack of gummy beans are sewn together. The time it takes to manufacture a packet of gummy beans will involve a single sewing line. After 220 minutes, the last sheet of fabric has been made in the assembly line.", "answer": " 40"}

But where do we get our food? Do animals eat plants, do plants eat animals, do animals eat animals or do they eat neither? We know that vegetarians or herbivores eat plants - as they don't have opposable thumbs, they can't kill to eat other animals and they eat their food raw. (It's good for their teeth and digestive system. The food comes from an ecosystem that makes food.) Carnivores kill to eat meat and they only eat meat. Omnivores don't have to kill to eat meat or plants, they will eat meat if it comes to them or if they have the ability to prepare it. So, in order to eat meat. carnivores and omnivores must have opposable thumbs. You must use your thumbs when you cook meat (no matter how much you trust those restaurant people) - because if you can't grill the meat on your own and wrap it appropriately you shouldn't eat it. Animals with large jaws or jawbones will have to dig for their food to eat and need an opposable thumb just to do that. But if they are strong enough to dig for their food, they can easily eat their food raw or cooked. So, they need an opposable thumb even if they eat plants. What is the conclusion? The world needs carnivores (who can eat meat or be eaten without an opposable thumb) to survive.\nOutput:The answer should be we do not need carnivores to survive.\n\nInput:Pick an integer n between 0 and 20, inclusive (inclusive means 0 includes all even", "answer": " 7"}

The standards in sixth\ngrade reflect the importance of building understanding\nof mathematics in the context of real-life, multi-step problems and other\nrelevant connections and providing time for reflection and discussion so\nstudents can build on their experience in learning how to\nreason mathematically. In addition, the standards emphasize the\napplication of mathematics to everyday life,\nillustrating that mathematics is relevant in many areas, encompassing\nthe range of occupations from which students in sixth grade choose\nThe sixth grade standards on fractions help\nstudents understand the meaning of fractional expressions and that\nconcepts about division relate to these expressions using division methods\n(such as area model). Students divide a set, compare and order fractions\nand mix numbers with fractions, and solve for a missing number in the set\nusing a strategy based on counting. Students recognize that some fractions are equal to a whole and use ratios to represent and\ndescribe relationships, including proportions. Students use reasoning (such\nas real-world examples) and a variety of tools and strategies to solve\nprobability problems, recognizing and applying various concepts\nincluding independent events, expected values and fair dice probabilities.\nMuch of the learning in sixth grade is focused\non the real-world context of multiplication and division and developing the\nconcepts of area, surface area, perimeter, volume and composite figures.\nStudents use arrays and area models to multiply and divide,\ndevelop and use formulas for the area and circumference of circles, and\nsolve real-world and mathematical problems involving surface area and\nvolume of figures composed of different types of quadrilaterals,\ncylinders, prisms and composite figures.

When it had 15 soldiers with 7 rifles, he needed 3 soldiers to each rifle, and they needed to carry an additional rifle to make an even dozen. There were 5 hunters in a deer herd. There were enough trees for 40 trees for each 17 hunters. When there were 23 hunters, the remaining deer herd split into two groups and left. Then, one group of 14 hunters was separated from their rifles as they split into two groups and then they left without their rifles, leaving behind 2 hunters in both groups. There were enough rifles to only leave one rifle out of the total for each 14 hunters that remained. There weren't enough rifles for each hunter to use one in combat.

{"text": "22\n\n\n### Instruction:In the next 30 minutes, you will work on creating a solution to the puzzle below.\n\n### Puzzle:There are five casks containing different liquids.  The liquids are milk, coffee, tea, juice, and water. The casks are labeled A, B, C, D, and E. The liquids were all obtained in a single trip to the grocery store by a single cashier using one shopping cart.  In each cask, there are the same number of items.  The liquids in the casks are not necessarily liquid mixtures. The liquids that are in casks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are not necessarily in a different order. One cask contains juice; it is not 1. The order of the other liquids is not preserved. In other words, juice could be in cask 1, milk could be in cask D, water could be in cask A, etc...  If this is the case, then the solution to the puzzle is impossible.  If it is possible for a solution to exist here, then there exists a cask (where 'cask' can be interpreted to equal 'bag', 'carton', etc...) that represents that the solution exists.)\n\n### Instructions:After the puzzle, you will work through a question sheet to understand how it worked.\n\n### Questions:This will work by making calculations and then seeing if there isn't a \"magic number\" in your results.  We start by setting up an easy first step.  We then write a formula that takes our result from the first step and uses the result from that step with another step.  That new value will then work to calculate our answer.  The process continues until the final results are shown.  The values used on each step will then be calculated from our initial inputs.  The final step will show the \"value\" of the entire process.  This is the process for the first 4 steps. I have set up the value from the first step. You may simply type in the values and the answer will be computed for you.\n\n### Input:In the previous problem, \"juice\" was in cask 1.  How many casks did you write", "answer": " 12"}

You're pretty certain that they're in love with each other, but can't decide which one is having the feeling first. George is a mathematician who likes to use a 24-hour clock, and Julia is a chemist who prefers to use a 12-hour clock. Which of them is in the best position to figure out which clock is correct, George and Julia's relative phases are a mystery. Let D = Day, P = PM. George always writes DD as his notation for 24-hour time, while Julia normally does not differentiate between PM and AM. She does this to avoid confusion if two days overlap. That is, Julia might write either 2D or D2 to express 2 PM or 2 AM. If George and Julia write the same notation for 24 hours, this means that the day has gone out of sync. Julia sometimes writes the absolute time like a regular person. For instance, if she thought George would understand her notation, she might write simply 2D. If she normally uses relative notation, she might also write PD instead.\nInput: The code that follows specifies the relative phases that George (G) and Julia (J) have.  DayPhase(G), HourPhase(J), and RelativePhase(G) specify their day and hour phases relative to the 24-hour cycle.  They also specify whether the phase is GMT or their own relative phase. If they're not writing in the same phase, then they're not syncing. If you're confused by which notation Julia likes to use from the phase specs, just remember that it", "answer": " 2"}

Her parents, my brother and his wife, want to build a game they can play with her at the dinner table that would give her a fun experience counting from 1 to 10. For the first round, the 2-year old will be the dealer.  After each player goes, the dealer will give everyone a \u201cpass\u201d card.  Each card can only be used once, so if a player passes, she can no longer use any cards she's passed.  After the first round, the child will be the dealer for the second round.  For example, here are the cards in the deck:  12: \"Dad\" 13: \"Mom\" 14: \"me?\" 15: \"too!\" 16: \"cat\" 17: \"dog\" 18: \"brother\" 19: \"cat\" 21: \"pizza\" 22: \"toast\" 23: \"snail\"   We'll need a card shuffling program to deal the cards.  Once all the cards have been dealt, the child will decide which card they're thinking of.  After everyone decides, the dealer will show everyone who passed what cards they picked.  The 2-year old is the winner if everyone else guessed wrong.  If only the 2-year-old guessed correctly and everyone else guessed wrong, a tie is declared.   Here are the cards being dealt:  \n\n![image](Problem_Description_for_My_Niece.png)  \n\nHow much will Bailey spend if she wants to buy 2 new towel sets for $40.0", "answer": " 224"}

{"text": "Input:In 2014, the US had a total of 1,269 public charter schools compared to a maximum of 1,241 in\n2007. (Note: Public Charter schools are publicly funded schools that operate independently from the traditional public schools). There have been many debates around charter schools nationwide. A recent study, conducted by researchers at Stanford University, found that charter schools were associated with a positive learning gain in math and reading test scores for their students. To determine if a state is providing a charter school system that is providing a positive benefit to their students, students should do the following: A) Create a scatter plot of learning gain in Reading test scores as measured by the Nation's Report Card and per-pupil expenditure. The learning gain refers to the difference in the average scores on a scale given to US schools by the National Report card from 2007 to 2014. For this exercise, the scores are taken in the same scale by adjusting for the difference in the difficulty between the tests between 2007 and 2014 (the adjusted score is called the learning gains in both years.) The expenditures are measured in 2014 US$. B) Create a scatter plot using the scores from the students from your school(s). For example, if your school has students in grades 5, 7 and 8, use the data for just those grades to create a data set, lable it with state name, charterschool name and your score in that section. C) Using your data and state data, create a linear regression with the following variables y - Learning gain in reading test scores x - Per-pupil expense\n\n* Note, the data, though not complete, are available to you on the website if\n* you feel you need it. The only data that you should use in your analysis is\n* the state of the charter school and the student data data you have created.\n\nD) To be considered a \"successful state\" there is a positive relationship between the amount of money spent on a charter school and the increase in learning gain. Based on the linear regression, determine whether or not a state should invest more money in its charter schools. If a trend line is not a good fit for the data, create a", "answer": " 14"}
